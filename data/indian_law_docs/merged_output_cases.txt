ix. Such interim order or orders as deemed fit just and proper in the circumstances of
the case.
2) The facts in brief are that the marriage of the applicant−aggrieved Mrs. Yogita and
the respondent− husband took place on 30.11.2001 at PTS Baraat Ghar, Malviya
Nagar, New Delhi according to the Hindu Rites & Rituals. The dowry articles were
given to the respondents which was kept by them.
The respondents were however not happy with the quantity of the dowry articles. The demands for
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. dowry kept on pouring from the respondents side and some
of the demands were met by the father of the applicant. A son was born to the couple in October
2002. The respondents turned the said occasion to an another opportunity for demanding more
dowry from the applicant's parents. The applicant was not treated well and she turned anemic. The
applicant was threatened with serious physical injuries in case the demands were not met. It was
due to the intervention of the common friends that the respondent assured the applicant that he
would keep her well. A letter of apology was written by the respondent−husband and the Annexure−
P1 has been exhibited as Ex. CW−1/1. The apology of the respondent No.1 turned out to be hollow
one and the sais respondent resumed to treat the applicant with cruelty and abuse.
3) The applicant was compelled to file various cases against the respondents which are :
i. FIR No.392/2003, under Section 498−A/406 IPC, registered at Police Station
Defense Colony.(this FIR was quashed by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court on
19.01.2004) ii. FIR No. 840 / 2006 u/s 323, 34, 406, 498−A, 506 of IPC(this FIR was
again lodged due to the continued abuses);
iii. Case under s.125 Cr.P.C.
4) A case for the custody of the child was also filed by the respondent No.1 which is
pending before the Guardianship Court. In the case the respondent No.1 had
admitted that he is in a sound financial condition. The copy of the said petition is
annexed as Annexure−P2 and has been exhibited Ex.
CW−1/2.
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc.
5) The applicant−aggrieved has also mentioned that on 16.06.2003 when she was at her parents'
house the respondent No.1 had visited and made a demand of Rs.1,00,000/− on the pretext of his
starting new business. On refusal the respondent turned aggressive and assaulted the applicant and
her parents. The respondent No.1 refused to take the applicant back till his demands were fulfilled.
The applicant and her parents were threatened and were told that the respondents had relations
with the local Politian. Subsequently, the applicant was served with a legal notice dated 29.06.2003
to which she replied vide reply dated 10.07.2003 and the copy of the same Annexure P−3 exhibited
) The vs . on 27 July, 2010

as Ex.CW−1/3. The applicant−aggrieved had filed the list of dowry articles before the CAW Cell
which is Annexure−P4 and has been exhibited as Ex.CW−1/4.
6) An FIR No.392/2003, under Section 498−A/406 IPC, registered at Police Station Defence Colony
was registered against the respondents who were grated anticipatory bail subject to the condition
that an amount of Rs.50,000/− was paid by them to the applicant−aggrieved. The said amount was
paid to the applicant. However, the respondent sought the compromise of the matter and were able
to convince the applicant. Subsequently, the applicant returned to her matrimonial house on
19.09.2003. Meanwhile , the respondent No.1 had filed CRL.M.C. 5133/2003 before the Hon'ble
Delhi High Court seeking the quashing of the FIR No. 392 of 2003 in which the applicant was
successfully persuaded to give statement in favour of the respondent No.1. Consequently, the FIR
No.392/2003, under Section 498−A/406 IPC, registered at Police Station Defence Colony was
quashed vide order dated 19.01.2004. However, the things would not improve for the applicant
herein and she was again abused and mistreated by the respondents. The amount of Rs.50,000/−
which paid during the anticipatory−bail proceedings was again asked to be returned to the
respondents herein. Certain dowry articles were also retuned by the applicant herein to the
respondents. The amount of Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. Rs.50,000/− was received by
the applicant herein from her father vide receipt annexed as Annexure P−5A.
7) The applicant herein did what the respondents wanted her to do in order to save her marriage.
However, It turned out that the respondents had cleverly staged the compromise in order to get out
of the criminal proceedings i.e. FIR No. 392/2003. The whole exercise was done in order have the
said FIR quashed and when it was eventually quashed the respondents resumed to inflict abuses and
violence on the applicant.
8) The applicant and the respondent No.1 were blessed with another son on 02.12.2004. The
respondents would not allow the applicant to meet with her elder son. The applicant herein would
another mental torture that the respondent is interested in marrying a lady name M. Punam
Maheshwari a business associate of the respondent No.1. The applicant objected to the said
relationship and suffered multiple physical injuries in the hands of the respondent No.1. The
respondents would starve the applicant. On 06.10.2006 came to the applicant and asked for more
money for the business of respondent No.1. On refusal the applicant was beaten by iron rode and an
attempt was made to burn her by pouring the kerosene oil. The knob of the LPG gas cylinder was
turned on. The applicant ran out of the house to rescue herself and reached the public road.
Meanwhile, the mother−in−law of the applicant came and snatched the baby which the applicant
was carrying. Before the applicant could have had recourse to the police authorities the respondent
No.1 called the PCR van so that a false case could be registered against the applicant. By now the
applicant had received much physical injuries leading to the swelling in the left forearm and the
wrist. The police arrived but would not listen to the applicant. No FIR was registered against the
applicant. On 07.10.2006 the applicant gave a complaint Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. in
writing to the police narrating the incidence. The applicant was sent for a medical check−up on
07.10.2006. The younger child's custody was restored to the applicant and she was sent to AIIMS for
her medical check−up on 11.10.2006 where she was treated. The medical reports are annexed as
Annexure P−6 and the copy of the same have been exhibited as Ex. CW−1/6. Meanwhile the parents
) The vs . on 27 July, 2010
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9120615/

of the applicant−aggrieved pursued the matter with the senior police officer and got the FIR No. 840
/ 2006 u/s 323, 34, 406, 498−A, 506 of IPC registered against the respondents. However, the police
did not do much investigations into the matter. Neither the amount of Rs.50,000/− was recovered
nor the stridhan articles were restored to the applicant herein. The recovery of the amount of
Rs.50,000/−. The FIR etc. are Annexure−P−7(colly).
9) The respondent is said to admitted that he has sound financial position. The said respondent is
said to be owning movable as well as immovable properties. The applicant herein has sought various
prayers in her main application u/s 12 of the PWDV Act,2005. The applicant got herself examined as
CW−1 and has tendered evidence by way of the affidavit and has exhibited various documents.
10) The respondents filed a reply and denied the allegations of domestic violence. It was also stated
that the respondent No.1 has been disowned by his parents (R−2 & R−3) and that he had no
property movable or immovable in his name. However, the respondents were proceeded ex−parte
on 15.04.2009. No evidence was lead by the said respondents.
11) At the very onset I need to address one necessary issue - the admissibility of documents. The
applicant−aggrieved has not exhibited the original documents. The aspect is technical still Ms.
Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. required to be decided as the same relates to the admissibility of
evidence. In the present case the applicant−aggrieved has exhibited the photocopies of various the
documents in her favour. The general law is that the photocopies are not primary evidence.
12) At this juncture, Ss. 61, 62 and 63 of the Evidence Act need to be looked into. S.61 lays down that
contents of the documents may be proved either by primary or by secondary evidence. This Section
is based upon the principal that "best evidence" in the possession or power of the party must be
produced. What the best evidence is, depends upon facts and circumstances of each case. Generally
speaking, the original document is the best evidence. The contents of every written paper are,
according to the ordinary and well established rules of evidence, required to be proved by the
original document, and by that alone, if the document is in existence. It is, therefore, necessary that
when a document is produced as primary or secondary evidence, it will have to be proved in the
manner laid down in Sections 67 to 73 of the Evidence Act. (see AIR 2008 BOMBAY 81 "Bank of
India v. Allibhoy Mohammed" BOMBAY HIGH COURT). Truth or otherwise of the facts or contents
so stated would have to be proved by admissible evidence, i.e. by the evidence of person who can
vouch for the truth of the facts in issue as held by the Apex Court in Ramji Dayawala and Sons Pvt.
Ltd v. Invest Import, A.I.R. 1981, S.C. 2085. Person with knowledge must be examined. Every
document should first be started by some proof before the person who disputed that document can
in any way be considered as proved because it's genuineness is not disputed by the opposite party.
Documents do not prove themselves.
13) Let me now deal with the photo copies of the documents filed on record. S.63 of the Evidence Act
provides for the leading of secondary evidence. Secondary evidence cannot be accepted without Ms.
Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. sufficient reason being given for non production of the original.
The loss of original document must be shown in order to lead secondary evidence. Secondary
evidence of the document can be allowed to be lead only where original is proved to have existed but
) The vs . on 27 July, 2010
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9120615/
4
was lost or misplaced (see AIR 1973 Bom
66. Filmistan Private Ltd. Co. v. The Municipal Corporation for Greater Bombay). The document
unless shown to have been compared with original one, mere copy of the document does not become
secondary evidence. The person giving oral evidence who accounts for the contents must have
himself seen the original document and not a mere copy. "Seen" here will obviously mean "read". A
person who proposes to testify the contents of a document, either by copy or otherwise, must have
read it. The contents of private documents may be proved as secondary evidence by any witness who
has in fact read them. The secondary evidence is required to be proved in the same manner in which
primary evidence. S. 65 of the Evidence Act provides that in each type of cases secondary evidence
relating to the document may be given. This Section enumerates the certain exceptional cases in
which secondary evidence is admissible. Secondary evidence is of the contents which cannot be
admitted without the production of document in such a manner within one or the other of the cases
as provided for in the Section. The prior permission of the Court required to be taken for producing
secondary evidence of the documents on the grounds that original documents were lost. To sum up,
when anybody wants to lead secondary evidence, two things are required to be proved; there must
be evidence of the existence of the original documents and there must be evidence of their loss.
14) In the present case no permission to lead secondary evidence was obtained by the applicant
herein. As per the order sheet when the evidence by way of affidavit was filed on 15.04.2009 by the
applicant herein it was nowhere stated that the originals were seen and returned. As far as the
exhibits CW−1/2 to CW−/6 are concerned, the exhibited documents cannot be said to be primary
evidence Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. since they are mere photo copies. No evidence is on
record to show that at any time in the past, original documents were in existence and that they are
lost. The secondary evidence of the contents of document is generally inadmissible until non
production of the original is first accounted for, so as to bring it within one or the other category of
the cases provided for in S. 65.
15) Now the question is whether or not the photocopies should be admitted as evidence. In this
regard I rely upon an authority of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the cases of Narbada Devi Gupta v.
Birendra Kumar Jaiswal (2003) 8 SCC 745 : (AIR 2004 SC 175) and R. V. E. Venkatachala Gounder
v. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami and V. P. Temple, (2003) 8 SCC 752 : (AIR 2003 SC 4548). In the later
case the Supreme Court has pointed out two different classes of 'objections' by observing as under :−
"......... Ordinarily, an objection to the admissibility of evidence should be taken when it is tendered
and not subsequently. The objections as to admissibility of documents in evidence may be classified
into two classes:
i. an objection that the document which is sought to be proved is itself inadmissible
in evidence, and ii. where the objection does not dispute the admissibility of the
document in evidence but is directed towards the mode of proof alleging the same to
be irregular or insufficient.
In the first case, merely because a document has been marked as "an exhibit", an Ms.
Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. objection as to its admissibility is not excluded
) The vs . on 27 July, 2010
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9120615/
5
and is available to be raised even at a later stage or even in appeal or revision. In the
latter case, the objection should be taken when the evidence is tendered and once the
document has been admitted in evidence and marked as an exhibit, the objection that
it should not have been admitted in evidence or that the mode adopted for proving
the document is irregular cannot be allowed to be raised at any stage subsequent to
the marking of the document as an exhibit. The latter proposition is a rule of fair
play. The crucial test is whether an objection, if taken at the appropriate point of
time, would have enabled the party tendering the evidence to cure the defect and
resort to such mode of proof as would be regular. The omission to object becomes
fatal because by his failure the party entitled to object allows the party tendering the
evidence to act on an assumption that the opposite party is not serious about the
mode of proof. On the other hand, a prompt objection does not prejudice the party
tendering the evidence, for two reasons, firstly, it enables the Court to apply its mind
and pronounce its decision on the question of admissibility then and there, and
secondly, in the event of finding of the Court on the mode of proof sought to be
adopted going against the party tendering the evidence, the opportunity of seeking
indulgence of the Court for permitting a regular mode or method of proof and
thereby removing the objection raised by the opposite party, is available to the party
leading the evidence. Such practice and procedure is fair to both the parties. Out of
the two types of objections, referred to hereinabove, in the latter case, failure to raise
a prompt and timely objection amounts to waiver of the necessity for insisting on
formal proof of a document, the document itself which is sought to be proved being
admissible in evidence. In the first case, acquiescence would be no bar to raising the
objection in a superior Court."
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc.
16) In the present case the respondents have been participating in the proceedings
from 15.12.2007 till 15.04.2009. The evidence by way of Affidavit was rendered on
15.09.2008. It therefore very relevant to consider that the said respondents were
proceeded ex−parte long after the evidence by way of the affidavit was rendered. Not
only that, the order sheet dated 28.01.2009 reveals that the respondents were
represented and that they had sought time to cross−examine the applicant herein.
The only unconvincing inference that could be drawn from the above circumstance is
that the respondents had ample opportunity to raise objections to the admissibility of
the exhibited documents. The ratio of Narbada Devi Gupta case (2003) 8 SCC 745)
and that of R. V. E. Venkatachala Gounder case [(2003) 8 SCC 752] comes to the
rescue of the applicant herein.
17) The other reason for this court to admit the photocopies is that the said documents are not
creating any right in favour of any party but only recording something. Such documents are
admissible in evidence. This view is supported by an authority of the Hon'ble Bombay high court
"Tex India v. Punjab and Sind Bank" reported in AIR 2003 BOMBAY 444. Keeping the above−
dimensioned authorities in mind I am not hesitant to hold that in the interest of justice the
) The vs . on 27 July, 2010
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9120615/
6
documents exhibited as CW−1/2 to CW−1/7 are admitted as evidence.
18) However, the document exhibited as Ex.CW−1/1 stated to be the apology of the respondent−
husband and hand−written by the said respondent is held not admissible for the reason that no
writing can be received in evidence as a genuine one until it has been proved to be in the writing of a
particular person. The production of the document purporting to have been signed or written by a
certain person is no evidence of its authorship. A writing, by itself, is not evidence of the one thing or
the other. Proof, therefore, has to be given of the handwriting. A writing, by itself, is evidence of
nothing, and therefore is not, unless accompanied by proof of some sort, admissible as evidence. For
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. the above−said reason the Ex.CW−1/1 is excluded.
19) In Sait Tarajee Khimchand v. Yamarti Satyam, AIR 1971 SC 1865, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
has very categorically held that mere marking of an exhibit does not dispense with the proof of
documents. To the similar effect is the decision in Thagiram Borah v. State of Assam, AIR 1980 Gau
59 and in Punjab National Bank v. Britannia Industries Ltd., 2002 (3) Civil Law Times
517. Now that the Ex. CW−1/2 to CW−7 have been admitted as an evidence the same does not
dispense with the burden of proving them. The said evidence needs to be now be evaluated.
20) Before coming to the merits of the case it is necessary to examine the historical background of
the said Act, the objects and reasons for the said enactment and the provisions contained therein.
This Act was actually enacted with a view to implement the General Recommendation No. XII
(1989) of The United Nations Committee on Convention on Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). India is a signatory to CEDAW, having accepted and
ratified it in June 1993. Article 16 of the said Convention, which deals with measures to eliminate
discrimination against women in matters relating to marriage and family relations, reads as follows :
"States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against
women in all matters relating to marriage and family relations and in particular shall
ensure, on a basis of equality of men and women :
(a) The same right to enter into marriage;
(b) The same right freely to choose spouse and to enter into marriage only with their
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. free and full consent;
(c) The same rights and responsibilities during marriage and at its dissolution;
(d) The same rights and responsibilities as parents, irrespective of their marital
status, in matters relating to their children; in all cases the interests of the children
shall be paramount;
(e) The same rights to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of
their children and to have access to the information, education and means to enable
) The vs . on 27 July, 2010

7
them to exercise these rights;
(f) The same rights and responsibilities with regard to guardianship, wardship,
trusteeship and adoption of children, or similar institutions where these concepts
exist in national legislation; in all cases the interests of the children shall be
paramount;
(g) The same personal rights as husband and wife, including the right to choosing a
family name, a profession and an occupation;
(h) The same rights for both spouses in respect of the ownership, acquisition,
management, administration, enjoyment and disposition of property, whether free of
charge or for a valuable consideration."
21) The PWDV Act, 2005 has been based on the Beijing Declaration which was build on consensus
and Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. progress made at various United Nations conferences
and summits − on women in Nairobi in 1985, on children in New York in 1990, on environment and
development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, on human rights in Vienna in 1993, on population and
development in Cairo in 1994 and on social development in Copenhagen in 1995 with the objectives
of achieving equality, development and peace. The focus is on equal rights and inherent human
dignity of women and men and other purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United
Nations, to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights
instruments, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against
Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as the Declaration on the Elimination
of Violence against Women and the Declarationon the Right to Development. It was recognized that
women's empowerment and their full participation on the basis of equality in all spheres of society,
including participation in the decision−making process and access to power, are fundamental for the
achievement of equality, development and peace.
22) The need was felt that there ought to be equal rights, opportunities and access to resources,
equal sharing of responsibilities for the family by men and women, and a harmonious partnership
between them are critical to their wellbeing and that of their families as well as to the consolidation
of democracy. It was further recognized that reaffirmation of the right of all women to control all
aspects of their health, in particular their own fertility, is basic to their empowerment. Very
intriguingly it was also observed in at the Beijing Declaration that Local, national, regional and
global peace is attainable and is inextricably linked with the advancement of women, who are a
fundamental force for leadership, conflict resolution and the promotion of lasting peace at all levels.
The men were sought to be encouraged to participate fully in all actions towards equality and to
promote women's economic independence. The Strategic objective was to revise national laws and
administrative practices to ensure women's equal rights and access to economic resources. The Ms.
Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. national governments were expected to undertake legislative and
administrative reforms to give women full and equal access to economic resources, including the
right to inheritance and to ownership of land and other property, credit, natural resources and
appropriate technologies. It was in this background that India responded by enacting various laws
) The vs . on 27 July, 2010
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9120615/
8
and the PWDV Act, 2005 happens to be the most recent one.
23) The first three paragraphs of the statement of object and reasons under which the Bill No. 116 of
2005 for passing the act was placed before the Parliament, are as under (published in the Gazette of
India Extraordinary Part II Section 2 page 22 dated 22nd August, 2005) :− I. "Domestic violence is
undoubtedly a human rights issue and serious deterrent to development. The Vienna Accord of 1994
and the Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action (1995) have acknowledged this. The United
Nations Committee on Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women
(CEDAW) in its General Recommendation No. XII (1989) has recommended that State parties
should act to protect women against violence of any kind especially that occurring within the family.
II. The phenomenon of domestic violence is widely prevalent but has remained largely invisible in
the public domain. Presently, where a woman is subjected to cruelty by her husband or his relatives,
it is an offence under Section 498−A of the Indian Penal Code. The civil law does not however
address this phenomenon in its entirety. III. It is, therefore, proposed to enact a law keeping in view
the rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution to provide for a remedy under
the civil law which is intended to protect the woman from being victims of domestic violence and to
prevent the occurrence of domestic violence in the society."
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc.
24) The PWDV Act,2005 was challenged in a case Aruna Parmod Shah v. Union of India reported in
2008(3) R.C.R.(Criminal) 191. The ground was that the PWDV Act, 2005 provided protection only
to women and not to men. The DB of the Hon'ble Delhi Court while upholding the vires of the
PWDV Act,2005 held:
"Domestic violence is a worldwide phenomenon and has been discussed in
international fora, including the Vienna Accord of 1994 and the Beijing Declaration
and the Platform for Action (1995). The United Nations Committee Convention on
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against women (CEDAW) has
recommended that States should act to protect women against violence of any kind,
especially that occurring within the family. There is a perception, not unfounded or
unjustified, that the lot and fate of women in India is an abjectly dismal one, which
requires bringing into place, on an urgent basis, protective and ameliorative
measures against exploitation of women. The argument that the Act is ultra vires the
Constitution of India because it accords protection only to women and not to men is,
therefore, wholly devoid of any merit. We do not rule out the possibility of a man
becoming the victim of domestic violence , but such cases would be few and far
between, thus not requiring or justifying the protection of Parliament."
25) CHAPTER IV of the PWDV Act, 2005 deals with the PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING ORDERS
OF RELIEFS. The provision of S.12 of the said Act empowers the Magistrate to deal with the
application under S.12 of the PWDV Act, 2005 and is worded thus:

(1) within a period of sixty days from the date of its first hearing.
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc.
26) The provision of S.12 of the PWDV Act, 2005 speaks of 'one or more reliefs under
this Act' which refers further to the other provisions providing various reliefs. The
applicant herein has sought various reliefs mentioned in the provisions from S.18 to
S.22 of the said Act. For granting such relief under S.12 PWDV Act, 2005 it is
essential to first see whether 'domestic violence' has been perpetuated. The PWDV
Act, 2005 defines domestic violence in S.3 (Ch. II) thus:
For the purposes of this Act, any act, omission or commission or conduct of the
respondent shall constitute domestic violence in case it −
(a) harms or injures or endangers the health, safety, life, limb or well−being, whether
mental or physical, of the aggrieved person or tends to do so and includes causing

physical abuse, sexual abuse, verbal and emotional abuse and economic abuse; or
(b) harasses, harms, injures or endangers the aggrieved person with a view to coerce
her or any other person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any dowry or
other property or valuable security; or
(c) has the effect of threatening the aggrieved person or any person related to her by
any conduct mentioned in clause (a) or clause (b); or
(d) otherwise injures or causes harm, whether physical or mental, to the aggrieved
person.
Explanation I.−For the purposes of this section,−
(i) "physical abuse" means any act or conduct which is of such a nature as to cause bodily pain,
harm, or danger to life, limb, or health or impair the health or development of the aggrieved person
and includes assault, criminal intimidation and criminal force;
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc.
(ii) "sexual abuse" includes any conduct of a sexual nature that abuses, humiliates, degrades or
otherwise violates the dignity of woman;
(iii) "verbal and emotional abuse" includes−
(a) insults, ridicule, humiliation, name calling and insults or ridicule specially with regard to not
having a child or a male child; and
(b) repeated threats to cause physical pain to any person in whom the aggrieved person is
interested.
(iv) "economic abuse" includes−
(a) deprivation of all or any economic or financial resources to which the aggrieved person is
entitled under any law or custom whether payable under an order of a court or otherwise or which
the aggrieved person requires out of necessity including, but not limited to, household necessities
for the aggrieved person and her children, if any, stridhan, property, jointly or separately owned by
the aggrieved person, payment of rental related to the shared household and maintenance;
(b) disposal of household effects, any alienation of assets whether movable or immovable, valuables,
shares, securities, bonds and the like or other property in which the aggrieved person has an interest
or is entitled to use by virtue of the domestic relationship or which may be reasonably required by
the aggrieved person or her children or her stridhan or any other property jointly or separately held
by the aggrieved person; and Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc.

(c) prohibition or restriction to continued access to resources or facilities which the aggrieved
person is entitled to use or enjoy by virtue of the domestic relationship including access to the
shared household.
Explanation II.−For the purpose of determining whether any act, omission, commission or conduct
of the respondent constitutes "domestic violence" under this section, the overall facts and
circumstances of the case shall be taken into consideration.
27) The definition of 'domestic violence' is widespread and overlaps with the definition of 'cruelty' as
provided under S.498−A IPC. Therefore, a demand of dowry would both be a penal offence as well
as a domestic violence. The prescription provided under the IPC is the 'imprisonment' up−to three
years whereas under the PWDV Act, 2005 the remedy provided is more of civil in nature. It was
observed by the HON'BLE MADHYA PRADESH HIGH COURT in "Ajay Kant v. Alka Sharma"
reported in 2008 CRI. L. J. 264 that basically the act has been passed to provide the
civil remedy against domestic violence to the women. However, as provided by
Sections 27 and 28 of the Act, a Judicial Magistrate of the first class or the
Metropolitan Magistrate has been empowered to grant a protection order and other
orders and to try the offence under the Act. Vide Section 28 of the Act, it is
mentioned that save as otherwise provided in this Act, all proceedings under Ss. 12,
18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 and the offences under Section 31 shall be governed by the
provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, Vide sub−sections 3 and 4 of
Section 19, it is also provided that a Magistrate may require from the respondent to
execute a bond, with or without sureties, for preventing the commission of domestic
violence and such order shall be deemed to be an order under Chapter VIII of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and shall be dealt with accordingly, Chapter VIII of
Cr. P.C. dealt with security for keeping peace and for good behavior which runs from
Sections 106 to 124. In Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. these Sections, it is
provided that for keeping the peace and maintaining good behavior, a person can be
directed by a Magistrate to execute a bond with or without sureties and in case of
non−compliance of such order, that person can be detained into custody. Section 31
of the Act provides penalty for breach of protection order passed by the Magistrate,
which is punishable as an offence.
28) We therefore find that though the PWDV Act, 2005 primarily addresses a civil
remedy, the procedure adopted is that of the criminal procedure. That is not unusual
as the provision of S.125 Cr.P.C. too, operates in the same fashion. The civil remedy
under the PWDV Act, 2005 ranges from providing damages to injunctions. The said
act does not provide for the punishment such as imprisonment or fine etc. The
PWDV Act, 2005 also does not define 'domestic violence' as a new 'offence'
altogether.
It is a different matter that S.31 PWDV Act, 2005 does prescribe breach of protection order by
respondent as a cognizable offence.

29) The provision of S.3(a) & (b) relates to the 'dangers' to the health, safety, life, limb or well−
being, whether mental or physical, of the aggrieved person. The provision of S.3(c) relates to the
threat to the aggrieved person by any conduct as mentioned in S.3(a) or S.3 (b). Therefore not only
the actual harassment is covered but any act, omission or commission or conduct of the respondent
having the effect of causing such a harassment shall constitute domestic violence. The terms like
'dowry' are also included in the definition. Here I would like to point out one more intricacy as far as
the illegal demand (of dowry is concerned). The term 'dowry' has not been used in the provision of
S.498−A I.P.C. but S.3 of the PWDV Act, 2005 does use the term 'dowry'. Another intricacy relates
to the fabric of the offence inasmuch as the S.498−A I.P.C. being a criminal offence needs evidence
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. beyond the reasonable doubt whereas under S.3 PWDV
Act,2005 the illegal demand may be proved by merely indicating the effect of any act, omission or
commission or conduct of the respondent. The civil remedy of 'dowry' as the 'domestic violence'
under the PWDV Act,2005 is thus differentiated from the criminal justice of 'illegal demand' under
the I.P.C. It is also for the said reason that any decision under the PWDV Act vis−à−vis 'dowry'
ought not affect the decision given under the criminal proceedings such as S.498−A I.P.C.
30) The 'domestic violence' is drafted to have included physical abuse, sexual abuse, verbal &
emotional abuse and economic abuse. As far as the evidence of the perpetration of 'domestic
violence' in the present case concerned the same has to be gauged in terms of the principles of legal
proof. The applicant−aggrieved herein has averred physical violence against her. The applicant−
aggrieved had filed the list of dowry articles before the CAW Cell which is annexed as Annexure−P4
and has been exhibited as Ex.CW−1/4. The complaints were made from time to the police. The
particular incidence of 06.10.2006 has been narrated in detail by the applicant where she was
beaten up. The applicant ran out of the house to rescue herself and reached the public road.
Meanwhile, the mother− in−law of the applicant came and snatched the baby which the applicant
was carrying. Before the applicant could have had recourse to the police authorities the respondent
No.1 called the PCR van so that a false case could be registered against the applicant. By now the
applicant had received much physical injuries leading to the swelling in the left forearm and the
wrist. The police arrived but would not listen to the applicant. No FIR was registered against the
applicant. On 07.10.2006 the applicant gave a complaint in writing to the police narrating the
incidence. The applicant was sent for a medical check−up on 07.10.2006. The younger child's
custody was restored to the applicant and she was sent to AIIMS for her medical check−up on
11.10.2006 where she was treated. Meanwhile the parents of the applicant−aggrieved pursued the
matter with the senior police officer Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. and got the FIR No. 840
/ 2006 u/s 323, 34, 406, 498−A, 506 of IPC registered against the respondents. The medical reports
are annexed as Annexure P−6 and the copy of the same have been exhibited as Ex. CW−1/6. The
said medical report reflects that the injuries were due to 'assault by the husband'. That goes to say
that the applicant while reporting the matter to the doctor gave the information that it is her
husband who did it. The sais stand was not changed even in the averments made in her application
under S.12 of PWDV, Act 2005 which was filed on 14.12.2007. The evidence seems credible and
trustworthy.
31) Sir Alfred Wills in his admirable book Wills' Circumstantial Evidence (Chapter VI) has laid down
certain rules regarding the burden of proof. The above principles have been duly incorporated in the
) The vs . on 27 July, 2010
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9120615/
13
provisions of S.101 and s.102 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. Two essential rules are :
"(1) the facts alleged as the basis of any legal inference must be clearly proved
connected with the factum probandum;
(2) the burden of proof is always on the party who asserts the existence of any fact,
which infers legal accountability."
32) The given segment of evidence encompasses the incidence particularly the one which had
occurred on 06.10.2006. The legal burden to introduce the said segment of evidence was on the
applicant. She did it. The mere introducing was not enough for her to have a decision. A fair support
of documents was required. The applicant did that as well. The issue of domestic violence became
very much alive and relevant in order to attract judicial deliberations. It was fairly established that
the domestic violence happened. The next step was to demolish the case put by the applicant. This
could only have been done through the cross−examination. The opportunity was indeed granted to
the Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. respondents but they never availed it. The applicant
herein discharged her burden and the respondent did not offer any evidence to counter or negate
the evidence of the applicant. This is how the applicant succeeded in establishing the fact dated
06.10.2006 and the series of facts thereafter. The narrated incidence depicts act or conduct (of such
a nature as to cause bodily pain, harm, or danger to life, limb, or health or impair the health or
development of the aggrieved herein) and is supported by the documents and has been clearly
established by her in her evidence.
33) As far as the sexual abuse is concerned the ingredients as per S.3 PWDV Act, 2005 includes any
conduct of a sexual nature that abuses, humiliates, degrades or otherwise violates the dignity of
woman. The applicant−aggrieved herein has not made any averments of that sort.
34) As far as "verbal and emotional abuse" abuses are concerned the applicant−aggrieved herein has
narrated incidences when she was insulted and ridiculed for bringing less dowry. The applicant was
tricked to give a favorable statement during the proceedings to have the FIR No. 392 of 2003
quashed. The FIR instituted by her were quashed. However, the respondents again resumed to
torture her. As a matter of fact the incident dated 06.01.2006 occurred when the FIR No.392 of
2003 were already quashed and the applicant was hoping a happy marital life. There is something
intriguing about the terms 'verbal' & 'emotional' being used together. The term 'verbal' typifies a
louder abuse - in tone. The 'emotional' abuse on the other hand is more characterized by 'silence'.
However both sorts of such abuses are mutually co−existing and the learned legislatures were sharp
enough to use the combination of 'verbal and 'emotional' together. In the present case it is not
denied by the respondents that the applicant−abused is living separately from the respondents.
Living separately:
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. either by choice or by compulsion, is an emotional abuse.
Another aspect of the emotional abuse happens to be the relationship of respondent No.1 with Ms.
Punam. I therefore hold that the emotional abuse stands established so far it relates to the inflicting
of the physical violence which resulted in the physical injuries sustained by the applicant.

35) As far as the economic abuse is concerned it would be relevant to state that this is the sort of
abuse which is the most prevalent. According to a research "Abuse in Intimate Relationships :
Defining the Multiple Dimensions and Terms. National Violence Against Women Prevention" by
Vera E. Mouradian, PhD. Batterers control victims' finances to prevent them from accessing
resources, working or maintaining control of earnings, achieving self−sufficiency, and gaining
financial independence. In another report "The Battered Women's Justice Project, Civil Office" by
Christine Thomas (Staff Attorney, BWJP Civil Office, June 2004) it has been observed:
"Because economic dependence and severe financial stress on abused women can so
acutely impact a survivor's choice to stay or leave an abusive relationship and because
economic abuse by batterers is often an aspect of the power and control over their
lives, stronger legal advocacy for economic safety and restitution is important to the
economic empowerment of battered women and the goal of assuring that women
may live free of violence and oppression by their intimate partners. The economic
relief available through a protection order may be an essential temporary mechanism
to ensure safety and promote economic justice for the survivor."
36) The above−mentioned report also stated that effective strategies to end violence against women
must include strong measures that promote economic security and restitution for survivors. Many
women Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. are compelled to stay in abusive relationships or
return to their batterers because of financial constraints and economic concerns. Moreover,
protection order proceedings are an appropriate and necessary venue to address the economic
injustice that often characterizes domestic violence. It is pertinent to acknowledge that even in the
most developed countries like the USA there are strong economic provisions for the women. For
instance, child support and/or temporary spousal maintenance awards are specifically authorized by
most state statutes; typically, these forms of emergency financial support to survivors and their
children can be obtained in protection order proceedings.
37) The PWDV Act,2005 is a legislation aimed at strengthening the economic independence of a
woman and therefore includes the aspect 'financial deprivation to the women' in the category of
'economic abuse'. Economic abuse can manifest itself in many different ways, and abusers can
victimize their partners even after they have left the abusive relationship. The PWDV Act, 2005, has
perceived that a woman needs 'economic' contribution from her husband in the light of 'domestic
violence'. The said Act is law which provides for more effective protection of the rights of women
guaranteed under the Constitution who are victims of violence of any kind occurring within the
family and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. In the present case it is not
disputed that the child is being brought up by the applicant−aggrieved single handedly and any
economic deprivation to the child (in which the applicant is certainly interested) is the economic
deprivation of the applicant.
38) In the present case there happens to be the most elaborated averment with in regard to
'stridhan' of the applicant−aggrieved. It has been deposed by CW−1 that all the articles have not
been returned to her. When the FIR No.392/2003, under Section 498−A/406 IPC, was registered at
Police Station Defence Colony the Sessions Court had granted the anticipatory bail to the accused on
) The vs . on 27 July, 2010

15
the condition Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. that Rs.50,000/− would be given to the
applicant herein. The amount of Rs.50,000/− was returned by the applicant herein to the
respondents to improve the relations. The applicant herein did what the respondents wanted her to
do in order to save her marriage. The issue of the wrongful retaining of Stridhan and the amount of
Rs.50,000/− is certainly an economic abuse if proved. The sort of evidence that was required was
the examination of the father who purportedly played part in returning the money to the
respondents. That has not been done. The sole evidence that we have is the averment of the
applicant. Certain dowry articles were also allegedly retuned by the applicant herein to the
respondents. The amount of Rs.50,000/− was received by the applicant herein from her father vide
receipt annexed as Annexure P−5A. It is relevant to hold that the receipt that is being mentioned of
is the one which was issued by the applicant and not the respondent. Moreover, the said receipt has
not been exhibited and proved. The applicant herein has not been able to discharge that initial
burden of establishing the particular fact of giving the The amount of Rs.50,000/− to the
respondents. The economic abuse regarding the stridhan and the amount of Rs.50,000/− is not
established.
THE RELIEF SOUGHT u/s 19 of the PWDV Act,2005
39) The provision of S.19 essentially deals with the Residence orders:
"(1) While disposing of an application under sub−section (1) of section 12, the
Magistrate may, on being satisfied that domestic violence has taken place, pass a
residence order −
(a) restraining the respondent from dispossessing or in any other manner disturbing
the possession of the aggrieved person from the shared household, whether or not the
respondent has a legal or equitable interest in the shared household;
(b) directing the respondent to remove himself from the shared household;
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc.
(c) restraining the respondent or any of his relatives from entering any portion of the
shared household in which the aggrieved person resides;
(d) restraining the respondent from alienating or disposing off the shared household
or encumbering the same;
(e) restraining the respondent from renouncing his rights in the shared household
except with the leave of the Magistrate; or
(f) directing the respondent to secure same level of alternate accommodation for the
aggrieved person as enjoyed by her in the shared household or to pay rent for the
same, if the circumstances so require:
) The vs . on 27 July, 2010
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9120615/
16
Provided that no order under clause (b) shall be passed against any person who is a
woman.
(2) The Magistrate may impose any additional conditions or pass any other direction
which he may deem reasonably necessary to protect or to provide for the safety of the
aggrieved person or any child of such aggrieved person.
(3) The Magistrate may require from the respondent to execute a bond, with or
without sureties, for preventing the commission of domestic violence. (4) An order
under sub−section (3) shall be deemed to be an order under Chapter VIII of the Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) and shall be dealt with accordingly. (5) While
passing an order under sub−section (1), sub−section (2) or sub−section (3), the court
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. may also pass an order directing the officer in
charge of the nearest police station to give protection to the aggrieved person or to
assist her or the person making an application on her behalf in the implementation of
the order.
(6) While making an order under sub−section (1), the Magistrate may impose on the
respondent obligations relating to the discharge of rent and other payments, having
regard to the financial needs and resources of the parties.
(7) The Magistrate may direct the officer in−charge of the police station in whose
jurisdiction the Magistrate has been approached to assist in the implementation of
the protection order. (8) The Magistrate may direct the respondent to return to the
possession of the aggrieved person her stridhan or any other property or valuable
security to which she is entitled to."
40) The relief(s) u/s 19 PWDV which have been sought the applicant herein are :
i. The residence orders u/s 19 of PWDV Act, 2005 thereby directing the respondents
to provide the applicant with the same level of residence as enjoyed by her when she
lived with the respondent No.1;
ii. The directions to the respondents to return the stridhan of the applicant to her. In
case the said stridhan and articles are not returned the applicant has sought an
additional compensation of Rs.12 Lacs;
41) The S. 19(1) (f) PWDV Act, 2005 provides that on being satisfied that domestic
violence has been perpetrated on the aggrieved woman the magistrate may direct the
respondent to secure same level of Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. alternate
accommodation for the aggrieved person as enjoyed by her in the shared household
or to pay rent for the same, if the circumstances so require. There is no doubt that the
said provision is aims at securing a shelter over the head of a woman either in the
shared household or elsewhere. The responsibility to do so is fastened on the
) The vs . on 27 July, 2010
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9120615/
17
respondents.
42) The kind of proof that was required on part of the applicant was the proof of the
level of accommodation that she had enjoyed in the shared household. There
happens to be no cogent evidence with that regard. An inference can only by drawn
from the overall financial position of the respondents. The mere averments would
show that the respondents are enjoying a comfortable life style. The provision of
S.19(6) empowers the magistrate to impose on the respondent obligations relating to
the discharge of rent and other payments, having regard to the financial needs and
resources of the parties.
43) It is pertinent to see that even before the advent of the Act, the right of a wife to
reside in the matrimonial home, was recognized as part of her right to maintenance,
in so far as Hindus are concerned. In para−12 of its judgment in B.P. Achala Anand v.
S. Appi Reddy and Another, 2005(3) SCC 313, the Supreme Court laid down the law
on the point as follows :
"A Hindu wife is entitled to be maintained by her husband. She is entitled to remain
under his roof and protection. She is also entitled to separate residence if by reason of
the husband's conduct or by his refusal to maintain her in his own place of residence
or for other just cause Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. she is compelled to live
apart from him. Right to residence is a part and parcel of wife's right to maintenance.
The right to maintenance cannot be defeated by the husband executing a Will to
defeat such a right. (See Mulla : Principles of Hindu Law, Vol. I, 18th Edn., 2001,
paras 554 and 555). The right has come to be statutorily recognised with the
enactment of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956. Section 18 of the Act
provides for maintenance of wife. Maintenance has been so defined in clause (b) of
Section 3 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 as to include therein
provision for residence amongst other things. For the purpose of maintenance the
term "wife" includes a divorced wife."
44) In the paragraph No. 17 of the petition filed by the respondent0husband it has been admitted
that the respondent herein had a sound financial background. The applicant herein cannot be
expected to stay in her father's house indefinitely. She is also entitled to separate residence if by
reason of the husband's conduct or by his refusal to maintain her in his own place of residence or for
other just cause she is compelled to live apart from him.
45) In the present case it has already been held that the domestic violence stands established by the
applicant particularly with respect to the incidence of physical injuries inflicted upon her body on
06.10.2006. That is sufficient reason for her to stay in a separate residence. I therefore direct the
respondents to pay a monthly rent of Rs.10,000/− (Rupees Ten Thousand) so that the applicant
could arrange for her accommodation.

46) The facts relating to the 'stridhan' articles essentially involve the factum of 'possession' of the
movable articles. The expression "possession" is a legal term and its proof varies with the nature of
property under the scrutiny of the courts and it can be proved by credible oral evidence as well. The
expression "Evidence" has been defined under Section 3 of the Evidence Act which means and
includes all statements which Courts permit or require to be made before it by witnesses in relation
to matters of fact under inquiry such statements are called oral evidence. The testimony of a reliable
witnesses about the possession cannot be brushed aside by giving superficial treatment or by
ignoring it. The Courts are required to weigh to the oral testimony adduced by the parties and its
ignorance would be treated to be fatal. In abundant caution, it is held that Courts while analysing
oral statements of the witnesses are required to keep in view the statements of those witnesses who
had deposed the acts of possession leading to an inference about possession of a party according to
the nature of the property under consideration in preference to the statements of the witnesses who
had stated only about possession simpliciter without stating any act of possession in favour of one
party or other. (see AIR 1997 RAJ. 230 "Kanti Lal v. Shanti Devi").
47) Although the applicant herein has filed the list of dowry articles before the CAW Cell which is
Annexure−P4 and has been exhibited as Ex.CW−1/4. However, the mere list would not prove the
possession. The handing over of the dowry articles is that segment of fact which should have been
brought out clearly by the applicant herein. In the Indian culture the actual delivery of the
possession of the dowry articles is done either by the father/son or by any concerned person who
could even be a relative. A bride sits pretty in the marriage while the arrangements etc. are made.
She only has an idea what she would take in her matrimonial house. That is to say that she does not
have the best knowledge of what she carries. The actual knowledge could only be provided by the
father / brother / relative etc. who handed the possession. It is for this reason that when a list of
dowry articles is Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. prepared the same ought to be signed and
countersigned by the giver and the taker. I can understand that this could appear a bit awkward at
the time of the marriage but the courts can come to definite conclusion only after being satisfied of
the 'possession' by one evidence or the other. Even the oral testimonies of the persons would do. It is
for this reason that I am skeptic of relying solely on the oral testimony of the applicant herein. The
sole oral evidence of the applicant (CW−1) is not able preponderate the probability.
48) There happens to be other difficulty in granting the relief of the recovery of the 'stridhan'. The
recovery has to be specific and so has to be evidence otherwise great difficulty arises in
implementing the same. The applicant has not been able to adduce that precise evidence which
could lead her to have the said relief. The ration in the judgment AIR 1997 RAJ. 230 "Kanti Lal v.
Shanti Devi" could not come to the rescue of the applicant. The rigors of the legal proof ought be
undergone in order to establish a particular fact. The prayer of the applicant with respect to the
restoring of the stridhan articles is declined.
49) However, I would caution myself in commenting more on the aspect of 'stridhan' a criminal
proceeding' is also pending u/s 406 IPC. I have only held on the basis of the requirements of the
PWDV Act, 2005.

50) Now I come to the monetary relief(s) to the applicant−aggrieved. The scheme of the PWDV Act,
2005 does provide for the interim monthly relief as well as the compensation & monetary damages
to the said applicant. According to S.20 of the PWDV Act, 2005:
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. (1) While disposing of an application under sub−section (1)
of section 12, the Magistrate may direct the respondent to pay monetary relief to meet the expenses
incurred and losses suffered by the aggrieved person and any child of the aggrieved person as a
result of the domestic violence and such relief may include, but not limited to,−
(a) the loss of earnings;
(b) the medical expenses;
(c) the loss caused due to the destruction, damage or removal of any property from the control of the
aggrieved person; and
(d) the maintenance for the aggrieved person as well as her children, if any, including an order
under or in addition to an order of maintenance under section 125 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) or any other law for the time being in force. (2) The monetary relief
granted under this section shall be adequate, fair and reasonable and consistent with the standard of
living to which the aggrieved person is accustomed. (3) The Magistrate shall have the power to order
an appropriate lump sum payment or monthly payments of maintenance, as the nature and
circumstances of the case may require. (4) The Magistrate shall send a copy of the order for
monetary relief made under sub−section (1) to the parties to the application and to the in charge of
the police station within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the respondent resides.
(5) The respondent shall pay the monetary relief granted to the aggrieved person within the Ms.
Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. period specified in the order under sub−section (1).
(6) Upon the failure on the part of the respondent to make payment in terms of the order under
sub−section (1), the Magistrate may direct the employer or a debtor of the respondent, to directly
pay to the aggrieved person or to deposit with the court a portion of the wages or salaries or debt
due to or accrued to the credit of the respondent, which amount may be adjusted towards the
monetary relief payable by the respondent.
51) The provision of S.20 PWDV Act,2005 deals with the monetary relief. It speaks of "monetary
relief to meet the expenses incurred and losses suffered by the aggrieved person and any child of the
aggrieved person as a result of the domestic violence." The monetary relief under S.20 thus takes
adequate care of the reality that an aggrieved−woman may have to bring up the children on her own.
However, the provision is characterized by two relevant factors:
i. the expenses incurred and ;

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9120615/
20
ii. the losses suffered by the aggrieved person and any child of the aggrieved person
as a result of the domestic violence.
52) The losses as prescribed include the loss of earnings; the medical expenses; the
loss caused due to the destruction, damage or removal of any property from the
control of the aggrieved person. The evidence that was required on part of the
applicant was to establish that the appropriate facts with respect to the losses as
mentioned under S.20 PWDV Act, 2005. The applicant had merely averred Ms.
Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. and deposed the financial status of the
respondents. The said provision is based on specific reimbursement rather than
general monetary maintenance. The applicant has sought Rs. Rs.25,000 per month
and the following prayer(s) which apparently fall under S.20 PWDV Act, 2005 and
the litigation cost of Rs.10,000/−
53) There can be no doubt that S.20(3) empowers the to order an appropriate lump
sum payment or monthly payments of maintenance, as the nature and circumstances
of the case may require.
Therefore the piece of evidence that would be required on part of the applicant herein in order
establish the monetary claim under S.20 is the elaboration of the expenses required and the loses
suffered. The only loss averred is that of Rs.10,000/− on the litigation. As far as the monthly
monetary relief is concerned the principle is that the sum so granted must be reasonable and
consistent with the standard of living to which the aggrieved person is accustomed. In Bhagwan v.
Kamla Devi (AIR 1975 SC 83) it was observed that the wife should be in a position to maintain
standard of living which is neither luxurious nor penurious but what is consistent with status of a
family. The applicant has admitted that she is getting some maintenance under S.125 Cr.P.C.
According to S.20 PWDV Act, 2005 the magistrate may still grant an additional maintenance
depending on the facts of the case. The applicant has asked for Rs.25,000/− per month
54) The term `maintenance' is defined in Black's Law Dictionary, (6th Edn. pp.953−54) thus; "The
furnishing by one person to another, for his or her support, of the means of living, or food, clothing,
shelter, etc., particularly where the legal relation of the parties is such that one is bound to support
the other, as between father and child or husband and wife'`. For computing maintenance the
following test have been laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Jasbir Kaur Sehgal v. District
Judge, Dehradun and Ors., 1997 (7) SCC 7, wherein it has been observed that "No set formula can be
laid for fixing the amount of maintenance. It has, in the very Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc.
nature of things, to depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. Some scope for leverage
can, however, be always there. The court has to consider the status of the parties, their respective
needs, the capacity of the husband to pay having regard to his reasonable expenses for his own
maintenance and of those he is obliged under the law and statutory but involuntary payments or
deductions. The amount of maintenance fixed for the wife should be such as she can live in
reasonable comfort considering her status and the mode of life she was used to when she lived with
her husband and also that she does not feel handicapped in the prosecution of her case. At the same
time, the amount so fixed cannot be excessive or extortionate."
) The vs . on 27 July, 2010
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9120615/
21
55) Considering the facts of the case I am inclined to grant a monthly maintenance of Rs.10,000/−
(Rupees Five Thousand) per month from the date of order after deducting the amount paid to the
applicant under the other litigations.
THE RELIEF SOUGHT u/s 22 of the PWDV Act,2005
56) Compensation to the victims of the crime is laso covered under S.357 of the Cr.P.C. In awarding
compensation, it is necessary for the Court to decide if the case is a fit one in which compensation
deserves to be awarded. If the Court is convinced that compensation should be paid, then quantum
of compensation is to be determined by taking into consideration the nature of the crime, the injury
suffered and the capacity of the convict to pay compensation etc. It goes without saying that the
amount of compensation has to be reasonable, which the person concerned is able to pay. If the
accused is not in a position to pay the compensation to the injured or his dependents to which they
are held to be entitled to, there could be no reason for the Court to direct such compensation.
(Sarwan Singh and Ors. Vs. St. of Punjab AIR 1978 SC 1525 : 2 (1978) 4 SCC 111 Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh.
Durgesh Mishra etc.
57) In Dilip S. Dahanukar Vs. Kotak Mahindra Co. Ltd. and Anr. [(2007) 6 SCC 528] explaining the
scope and the purpose of imposition of fine and/or grant of compensation, it was observed that the
purpose of imposition of fine and/ or grant of compensation to a great extent must be considered
having the relevant factors therefore in mind. It may be compensating the person in one way or the
other. The amount of compensation sought to be imposed, thus, must be reasonable and not
arbitrary. Before issuing a direction to pay compensation, the capacity of accused to pay the same
must be judged. A fortiori, an enquiry in this behalf even in a summary way may be necessary. Some
reasons, which may not be very elaborate, may also have to be assigned; the purpose being that
whereas the power to impose fine is limited and direction to pay compensation can be made for one
or the other, factors enumerated out of the same; but S.357(3) does not impose any such limitation
and power there−under should be exercised only in appropriate cases. Such a jurisdiction cannot be
exercised at the whims and caprice of a Judge.
58) As far as the monetary relief under S.22 PWDV Act, 2005 is concerned the same deals with
compensatory orders and says:"In addition to other reliefs as may be granted under this Act, the
Magistrate may on an application being made by the aggrieved person, pass an order directing the
respondent to pay compensation and damages for the injuries, including mental torture and
emotional distress, caused by the acts of domestic violence committed by that respondent."
59) The compensation provided under S.22 is a onetime payment in addition to the payment
(monthly or lump−sum) granted under S.20 of the PWDV Act,2005. The scheme of the said act
covers the aspect of human agony and also uses the terminology of 'damages' which is usually used
in the Indian Contract Act, 1872. However, the commercial transactions under the contractual
obligations give little significance to the human agony. For instance the illustration (n) appended
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. to S.73 of the Indian Contract Act, 1972 says: "A contracts to
pay a sum of money to B on a day specified. A does not pay the money on that day; B, in
consequence of not receiving the money on that day, is unable to pay his debts, and is totally ruined.
) The vs . on 27 July, 2010
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9120615/
22
A is not liable to make good to B anything except the principal sum he contracted to pay, together
with interest up to the day of payment."
60) The human agony of a trader being ruined by the untimely payment of money from his debtor
attracts no more remedy than the mere principle amount along−with the interest. In the commercial
transaction the damages must have been arisen naturally in the usual course of things from such
breach, or which the parties knew, when they made the contract, to be likely to result from the
breach of it. The provision under S.22 PWDV Act, 2005 though speaks of 'damages' and
'compensation', there happens to be a human touch to it. The said human touch is further
strengthened by the fact that no statutory device has been provided in order to gauge the said
damage. It is even more human that the provision of S.20 of the PWDV Act, 2005 which is guided by
the loss of earning etc. Now the question is what amount is deserved by the applicant in the present
case in the circumstances where in particular the emotional & economical abuses stand reasonable
established.
61) The statute PWDV Act,2005 uses two terms together i.e. 'compensation' and 'damages' and by
using two terms together the legislators have imported the concept of compensatory damages and
the punitive damages which could deter the respondent from committing a similar action in the
future. The ingredients of the measure of such compensation & damages are roughly enumerated as
in terms of: the injuries, including mental torture and emotional distress. There is however no test
provided. How can the mental torture and the emotional distress be proved? It has been held in AIR
1973 Delhi 200 that it may safely be stated that any conduct of the husband which causes disgrace to
the wife or subjects her to a course of annoyance and indignity amounts to legal cruelty. Proof
beyond Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. reasonable doubt is not postulated where human
relationship is involved and eye−witnesses are difficult to obtain. Similar proposition was laid down
in Shobha Rani v. Madhukar Reddi, AIR 1988 SC 121. As far as 'emotional distress' is concerned the
said terminology is more akin to torts. While granting damages there are 'mitigation rules' whereas
in 'emotional distress' there happens to be no mitigation rules particularly when one is dealing with
the human relations out of matrimony and the likes. By combining 'damages' with 'emotional
distress' the provision of S.22 of the PWDV Act, 2005 thus seems to have enunciated the concept of
'matrimonial tort'. Courts have awarded damages for emotional distress primarily when the
'physical injury' has resulted and not otherwise. Originally at common law, a plaintiff could not
recover for physical injury from fright alone absent an impact even though the defendant was shown
to have operated a railroad negligently (shock without impact). In an English case Victorian
Railways Commissioners v. Coultas [(1888) 13 AC 222] a woman was barred from recovery due to
shock despite suffering a miscarriage. Even with intentional conduct, absent material damage,
claims for emotional harm were similarly barred. "Mental pain or anxiety, the law cannot value, and
does not pretend to redress, when the unlawful act causes that alone. Courts had been reluctant to
accept a tort for emotional harm for fear of opening a "wide door"
to frivolous claims. [Mitchell v. Rochester Railway Co. 151 NY 107 (1896)]. The idea
that shock without impact would be a bar to recovery was first questioned at the
Queen's Bench in Pugh v. London etc. Railroad Co.([1896] 2 QB 248. )

62) The PWDV Act, 2005 has added 'mental torture' thereby clarifying that 'mental
injury' is as much the part of 'emotional distress'. The definition of 'emotional
distress' is thus expanded under the PWDV Act, 2005. This expanded definition finds
great support from the recently developed concept of Intentional infliction of
emotional distress (IIED) which is a tort that results in extreme emotional distress.
Some jurisdictions refer to it as the tort of outrage.
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc.
63) In matrimonial cases the very domestic violence would cause mental distress
whether physical abuse is inflicted or not. The physical abuse would add to emotional
distress. The PWDV Act, 2005 addresses such emotional distress by providing for the
damages to the aggrieved woman. The measure of the damages could well be done by
the general principles of applying test of directness while not relying too much upon
the remote possibilities even if human agony is considered. Compensation can assist
women to deal with the aftermath of violence at both a practical and symbolic level.
The applicant−aggrieved has been able to establish the physical abuse and has sought
Rs.10 Lakh as compensation and damages. After going through the whole evidence
and the overall circumstances I am inclined to grant the damages and compensation
of Rs.1 Lakh to the applicant−aggrieved.

ix. Such interim order or orders as deemed fit just and proper in the circumstances of
the case.
2) The facts in brief are that the marriage of the applicant−aggrieved Mrs. Yogita and
the respondent− husband took place on 30.11.2001 at PTS Baraat Ghar, Malviya
Nagar, New Delhi according to the Hindu Rites & Rituals. The dowry articles were
given to the respondents which was kept by them.
The respondents were however not happy with the quantity of the dowry articles. The demands for
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. dowry kept on pouring from the respondents side and some
of the demands were met by the father of the applicant. A son was born to the couple in October
2002. The respondents turned the said occasion to an another opportunity for demanding more
dowry from the applicant's parents. The applicant was not treated well and she turned anemic. The
applicant was threatened with serious physical injuries in case the demands were not met. It was
due to the intervention of the common friends that the respondent assured the applicant that he
would keep her well. A letter of apology was written by the respondent−husband and the Annexure−
P1 has been exhibited as Ex. CW−1/1. The apology of the respondent No.1 turned out to be hollow
one and the sais respondent resumed to treat the applicant with cruelty and abuse.
3) The applicant was compelled to file various cases against the respondents which are :
i. FIR No.392/2003, under Section 498−A/406 IPC, registered at Police Station
Defense Colony.(this FIR was quashed by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court on
19.01.2004) ii. FIR No. 840 / 2006 u/s 323, 34, 406, 498−A, 506 of IPC(this FIR was
again lodged due to the continued abuses);
iii. Case under s.125 Cr.P.C.
4) A case for the custody of the child was also filed by the respondent No.1 which is
pending before the Guardianship Court. In the case the respondent No.1 had
admitted that he is in a sound financial condition. The copy of the said petition is
annexed as Annexure−P2 and has been exhibited Ex.
CW−1/2.
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc.
5) The applicant−aggrieved has also mentioned that on 16.06.2003 when she was at her parents'
house the respondent No.1 had visited and made a demand of Rs.1,00,000/− on the pretext of his
starting new business. On refusal the respondent turned aggressive and assaulted the applicant and
her parents. The respondent No.1 refused to take the applicant back till his demands were fulfilled.
The applicant and her parents were threatened and were told that the respondents had relations
with the local Politian. Subsequently, the applicant was served with a legal notice dated 29.06.2003
to which she replied vide reply dated 10.07.2003 and the copy of the same Annexure P−3 exhibited
) The vs . on 27 July, 2010
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9120615/
2
as Ex.CW−1/3. The applicant−aggrieved had filed the list of dowry articles before the CAW Cell
which is Annexure−P4 and has been exhibited as Ex.CW−1/4.
6) An FIR No.392/2003, under Section 498−A/406 IPC, registered at Police Station Defence Colony
was registered against the respondents who were grated anticipatory bail subject to the condition
that an amount of Rs.50,000/− was paid by them to the applicant−aggrieved. The said amount was
paid to the applicant. However, the respondent sought the compromise of the matter and were able
to convince the applicant. Subsequently, the applicant returned to her matrimonial house on
19.09.2003. Meanwhile , the respondent No.1 had filed CRL.M.C. 5133/2003 before the Hon'ble
Delhi High Court seeking the quashing of the FIR No. 392 of 2003 in which the applicant was
successfully persuaded to give statement in favour of the respondent No.1. Consequently, the FIR
No.392/2003, under Section 498−A/406 IPC, registered at Police Station Defence Colony was
quashed vide order dated 19.01.2004. However, the things would not improve for the applicant
herein and she was again abused and mistreated by the respondents. The amount of Rs.50,000/−
which paid during the anticipatory−bail proceedings was again asked to be returned to the
respondents herein. Certain dowry articles were also retuned by the applicant herein to the
respondents. The amount of Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. Rs.50,000/− was received by
the applicant herein from her father vide receipt annexed as Annexure P−5A.
7) The applicant herein did what the respondents wanted her to do in order to save her marriage.
However, It turned out that the respondents had cleverly staged the compromise in order to get out
of the criminal proceedings i.e. FIR No. 392/2003. The whole exercise was done in order have the
said FIR quashed and when it was eventually quashed the respondents resumed to inflict abuses and
violence on the applicant.
8) The applicant and the respondent No.1 were blessed with another son on 02.12.2004. The
respondents would not allow the applicant to meet with her elder son. The applicant herein would
another mental torture that the respondent is interested in marrying a lady name M. Punam
Maheshwari a business associate of the respondent No.1. The applicant objected to the said
relationship and suffered multiple physical injuries in the hands of the respondent No.1. The
respondents would starve the applicant. On 06.10.2006 came to the applicant and asked for more
money for the business of respondent No.1. On refusal the applicant was beaten by iron rode and an
attempt was made to burn her by pouring the kerosene oil. The knob of the LPG gas cylinder was
turned on. The applicant ran out of the house to rescue herself and reached the public road.
Meanwhile, the mother−in−law of the applicant came and snatched the baby which the applicant
was carrying. Before the applicant could have had recourse to the police authorities the respondent
No.1 called the PCR van so that a false case could be registered against the applicant. By now the
applicant had received much physical injuries leading to the swelling in the left forearm and the
wrist. The police arrived but would not listen to the applicant. No FIR was registered against the
applicant. On 07.10.2006 the applicant gave a complaint Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. in
writing to the police narrating the incidence. The applicant was sent for a medical check−up on
07.10.2006. The younger child's custody was restored to the applicant and she was sent to AIIMS for
her medical check−up on 11.10.2006 where she was treated. The medical reports are annexed as
Annexure P−6 and the copy of the same have been exhibited as Ex. CW−1/6. Meanwhile the parents
) The vs . on 27 July, 2010
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9120615/

of the applicant−aggrieved pursued the matter with the senior police officer and got the FIR No. 840
/ 2006 u/s 323, 34, 406, 498−A, 506 of IPC registered against the respondents. However, the police
did not do much investigations into the matter. Neither the amount of Rs.50,000/− was recovered
nor the stridhan articles were restored to the applicant herein. The recovery of the amount of
Rs.50,000/−. The FIR etc. are Annexure−P−7(colly).
9) The respondent is said to admitted that he has sound financial position. The said respondent is
said to be owning movable as well as immovable properties. The applicant herein has sought various
prayers in her main application u/s 12 of the PWDV Act,2005. The applicant got herself examined as
CW−1 and has tendered evidence by way of the affidavit and has exhibited various documents.
10) The respondents filed a reply and denied the allegations of domestic violence. It was also stated
that the respondent No.1 has been disowned by his parents (R−2 & R−3) and that he had no
property movable or immovable in his name. However, the respondents were proceeded ex−parte
on 15.04.2009. No evidence was lead by the said respondents.
11) At the very onset I need to address one necessary issue - the admissibility of documents. The
applicant−aggrieved has not exhibited the original documents. The aspect is technical still Ms.
Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. required to be decided as the same relates to the admissibility of
evidence. In the present case the applicant−aggrieved has exhibited the photocopies of various the
documents in her favour. The general law is that the photocopies are not primary evidence.
12) At this juncture, Ss. 61, 62 and 63 of the Evidence Act need to be looked into. S.61 lays down that
contents of the documents may be proved either by primary or by secondary evidence. This Section
is based upon the principal that "best evidence" in the possession or power of the party must be
produced. What the best evidence is, depends upon facts and circumstances of each case. Generally
speaking, the original document is the best evidence. The contents of every written paper are,
according to the ordinary and well established rules of evidence, required to be proved by the
original document, and by that alone, if the document is in existence. It is, therefore, necessary that
when a document is produced as primary or secondary evidence, it will have to be proved in the
manner laid down in Sections 67 to 73 of the Evidence Act. (see AIR 2008 BOMBAY 81 "Bank of
India v. Allibhoy Mohammed" BOMBAY HIGH COURT). Truth or otherwise of the facts or contents
so stated would have to be proved by admissible evidence, i.e. by the evidence of person who can
vouch for the truth of the facts in issue as held by the Apex Court in Ramji Dayawala and Sons Pvt.
Ltd v. Invest Import, A.I.R. 1981, S.C. 2085. Person with knowledge must be examined. Every
document should first be started by some proof before the person who disputed that document can
in any way be considered as proved because it's genuineness is not disputed by the opposite party.
Documents do not prove themselves.
13) Let me now deal with the photo copies of the documents filed on record. S.63 of the Evidence Act
provides for the leading of secondary evidence. Secondary evidence cannot be accepted without Ms.
Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. sufficient reason being given for non production of the original.
The loss of original document must be shown in order to lead secondary evidence. Secondary
evidence of the document can be allowed to be lead only where original is proved to have existed but
) The vs . on 27 July, 2010
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9120615/
4
was lost or misplaced (see AIR 1973 Bom
66. Filmistan Private Ltd. Co. v. The Municipal Corporation for Greater Bombay). The document
unless shown to have been compared with original one, mere copy of the document does not become
secondary evidence. The person giving oral evidence who accounts for the contents must have
himself seen the original document and not a mere copy. "Seen" here will obviously mean "read". A
person who proposes to testify the contents of a document, either by copy or otherwise, must have
read it. The contents of private documents may be proved as secondary evidence by any witness who
has in fact read them. The secondary evidence is required to be proved in the same manner in which
primary evidence. S. 65 of the Evidence Act provides that in each type of cases secondary evidence
relating to the document may be given. This Section enumerates the certain exceptional cases in
which secondary evidence is admissible. Secondary evidence is of the contents which cannot be
admitted without the production of document in such a manner within one or the other of the cases
as provided for in the Section. The prior permission of the Court required to be taken for producing
secondary evidence of the documents on the grounds that original documents were lost. To sum up,
when anybody wants to lead secondary evidence, two things are required to be proved; there must
be evidence of the existence of the original documents and there must be evidence of their loss.
14) In the present case no permission to lead secondary evidence was obtained by the applicant
herein. As per the order sheet when the evidence by way of affidavit was filed on 15.04.2009 by the
applicant herein it was nowhere stated that the originals were seen and returned. As far as the
exhibits CW−1/2 to CW−/6 are concerned, the exhibited documents cannot be said to be primary
evidence Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. since they are mere photo copies. No evidence is on
record to show that at any time in the past, original documents were in existence and that they are
lost. The secondary evidence of the contents of document is generally inadmissible until non
production of the original is first accounted for, so as to bring it within one or the other category of
the cases provided for in S. 65.
15) Now the question is whether or not the photocopies should be admitted as evidence. In this
regard I rely upon an authority of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the cases of Narbada Devi Gupta v.
Birendra Kumar Jaiswal (2003) 8 SCC 745 : (AIR 2004 SC 175) and R. V. E. Venkatachala Gounder
v. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami and V. P. Temple, (2003) 8 SCC 752 : (AIR 2003 SC 4548). In the later
case the Supreme Court has pointed out two different classes of 'objections' by observing as under :−
"......... Ordinarily, an objection to the admissibility of evidence should be taken when it is tendered
and not subsequently. The objections as to admissibility of documents in evidence may be classified
into two classes:
i. an objection that the document which is sought to be proved is itself inadmissible
in evidence, and ii. where the objection does not dispute the admissibility of the
document in evidence but is directed towards the mode of proof alleging the same to
be irregular or insufficient.
In the first case, merely because a document has been marked as "an exhibit", an Ms.
Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. objection as to its admissibility is not excluded
) The vs . on 27 July, 2010
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9120615/
5
and is available to be raised even at a later stage or even in appeal or revision. In the
latter case, the objection should be taken when the evidence is tendered and once the
document has been admitted in evidence and marked as an exhibit, the objection that
it should not have been admitted in evidence or that the mode adopted for proving
the document is irregular cannot be allowed to be raised at any stage subsequent to
the marking of the document as an exhibit. The latter proposition is a rule of fair
play. The crucial test is whether an objection, if taken at the appropriate point of
time, would have enabled the party tendering the evidence to cure the defect and
resort to such mode of proof as would be regular. The omission to object becomes
fatal because by his failure the party entitled to object allows the party tendering the
evidence to act on an assumption that the opposite party is not serious about the
mode of proof. On the other hand, a prompt objection does not prejudice the party
tendering the evidence, for two reasons, firstly, it enables the Court to apply its mind
and pronounce its decision on the question of admissibility then and there, and
secondly, in the event of finding of the Court on the mode of proof sought to be
adopted going against the party tendering the evidence, the opportunity of seeking
indulgence of the Court for permitting a regular mode or method of proof and
thereby removing the objection raised by the opposite party, is available to the party
leading the evidence. Such practice and procedure is fair to both the parties. Out of
the two types of objections, referred to hereinabove, in the latter case, failure to raise
a prompt and timely objection amounts to waiver of the necessity for insisting on
formal proof of a document, the document itself which is sought to be proved being
admissible in evidence. In the first case, acquiescence would be no bar to raising the
objection in a superior Court."
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc.
16) In the present case the respondents have been participating in the proceedings
from 15.12.2007 till 15.04.2009. The evidence by way of Affidavit was rendered on
15.09.2008. It therefore very relevant to consider that the said respondents were
proceeded ex−parte long after the evidence by way of the affidavit was rendered. Not
only that, the order sheet dated 28.01.2009 reveals that the respondents were
represented and that they had sought time to cross−examine the applicant herein.
The only unconvincing inference that could be drawn from the above circumstance is
that the respondents had ample opportunity to raise objections to the admissibility of
the exhibited documents. The ratio of Narbada Devi Gupta case (2003) 8 SCC 745)
and that of R. V. E. Venkatachala Gounder case [(2003) 8 SCC 752] comes to the
rescue of the applicant herein.
17) The other reason for this court to admit the photocopies is that the said documents are not
creating any right in favour of any party but only recording something. Such documents are
admissible in evidence. This view is supported by an authority of the Hon'ble Bombay high court
"Tex India v. Punjab and Sind Bank" reported in AIR 2003 BOMBAY 444. Keeping the above−
dimensioned authorities in mind I am not hesitant to hold that in the interest of justice the
) The vs . on 27 July, 2010
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9120615/
6
documents exhibited as CW−1/2 to CW−1/7 are admitted as evidence.
18) However, the document exhibited as Ex.CW−1/1 stated to be the apology of the respondent−
husband and hand−written by the said respondent is held not admissible for the reason that no
writing can be received in evidence as a genuine one until it has been proved to be in the writing of a
particular person. The production of the document purporting to have been signed or written by a
certain person is no evidence of its authorship. A writing, by itself, is not evidence of the one thing or
the other. Proof, therefore, has to be given of the handwriting. A writing, by itself, is evidence of
nothing, and therefore is not, unless accompanied by proof of some sort, admissible as evidence. For
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. the above−said reason the Ex.CW−1/1 is excluded.
19) In Sait Tarajee Khimchand v. Yamarti Satyam, AIR 1971 SC 1865, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
has very categorically held that mere marking of an exhibit does not dispense with the proof of
documents. To the similar effect is the decision in Thagiram Borah v. State of Assam, AIR 1980 Gau
59 and in Punjab National Bank v. Britannia Industries Ltd., 2002 (3) Civil Law Times
517. Now that the Ex. CW−1/2 to CW−7 have been admitted as an evidence the same does not
dispense with the burden of proving them. The said evidence needs to be now be evaluated.
20) Before coming to the merits of the case it is necessary to examine the historical background of
the said Act, the objects and reasons for the said enactment and the provisions contained therein.
This Act was actually enacted with a view to implement the General Recommendation No. XII
(1989) of The United Nations Committee on Convention on Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). India is a signatory to CEDAW, having accepted and
ratified it in June 1993. Article 16 of the said Convention, which deals with measures to eliminate
discrimination against women in matters relating to marriage and family relations, reads as follows :
"States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against
women in all matters relating to marriage and family relations and in particular shall
ensure, on a basis of equality of men and women :
(a) The same right to enter into marriage;
(b) The same right freely to choose spouse and to enter into marriage only with their
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. free and full consent;
(c) The same rights and responsibilities during marriage and at its dissolution;
(d) The same rights and responsibilities as parents, irrespective of their marital
status, in matters relating to their children; in all cases the interests of the children
shall be paramount;
(e) The same rights to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of
their children and to have access to the information, education and means to enable
) The vs . on 27 July, 2010

7
them to exercise these rights;
(f) The same rights and responsibilities with regard to guardianship, wardship,
trusteeship and adoption of children, or similar institutions where these concepts
exist in national legislation; in all cases the interests of the children shall be
paramount;
(g) The same personal rights as husband and wife, including the right to choosing a
family name, a profession and an occupation;
(h) The same rights for both spouses in respect of the ownership, acquisition,
management, administration, enjoyment and disposition of property, whether free of
charge or for a valuable consideration."
21) The PWDV Act, 2005 has been based on the Beijing Declaration which was build on consensus
and Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. progress made at various United Nations conferences
and summits − on women in Nairobi in 1985, on children in New York in 1990, on environment and
development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, on human rights in Vienna in 1993, on population and
development in Cairo in 1994 and on social development in Copenhagen in 1995 with the objectives
of achieving equality, development and peace. The focus is on equal rights and inherent human
dignity of women and men and other purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United
Nations, to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights
instruments, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against
Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as the Declaration on the Elimination
of Violence against Women and the Declarationon the Right to Development. It was recognized that
women's empowerment and their full participation on the basis of equality in all spheres of society,
including participation in the decision−making process and access to power, are fundamental for the
achievement of equality, development and peace.
22) The need was felt that there ought to be equal rights, opportunities and access to resources,
equal sharing of responsibilities for the family by men and women, and a harmonious partnership
between them are critical to their wellbeing and that of their families as well as to the consolidation
of democracy. It was further recognized that reaffirmation of the right of all women to control all
aspects of their health, in particular their own fertility, is basic to their empowerment. Very
intriguingly it was also observed in at the Beijing Declaration that Local, national, regional and
global peace is attainable and is inextricably linked with the advancement of women, who are a
fundamental force for leadership, conflict resolution and the promotion of lasting peace at all levels.
The men were sought to be encouraged to participate fully in all actions towards equality and to
promote women's economic independence. The Strategic objective was to revise national laws and
administrative practices to ensure women's equal rights and access to economic resources. The Ms.
Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. national governments were expected to undertake legislative and
administrative reforms to give women full and equal access to economic resources, including the
right to inheritance and to ownership of land and other property, credit, natural resources and
appropriate technologies. It was in this background that India responded by enacting various laws

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9120615/
8
and the PWDV Act, 2005 happens to be the most recent one.
23) The first three paragraphs of the statement of object and reasons under which the Bill No. 116 of
2005 for passing the act was placed before the Parliament, are as under (published in the Gazette of
India Extraordinary Part II Section 2 page 22 dated 22nd August, 2005) :− I. "Domestic violence is
undoubtedly a human rights issue and serious deterrent to development. The Vienna Accord of 1994
and the Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action (1995) have acknowledged this. The United
Nations Committee on Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women
(CEDAW) in its General Recommendation No. XII (1989) has recommended that State parties
should act to protect women against violence of any kind especially that occurring within the family.
II. The phenomenon of domestic violence is widely prevalent but has remained largely invisible in
the public domain. Presently, where a woman is subjected to cruelty by her husband or his relatives,
it is an offence under Section 498−A of the Indian Penal Code. The civil law does not however
address this phenomenon in its entirety. III. It is, therefore, proposed to enact a law keeping in view
the rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution to provide for a remedy under
the civil law which is intended to protect the woman from being victims of domestic violence and to
prevent the occurrence of domestic violence in the society."
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc.
24) The PWDV Act,2005 was challenged in a case Aruna Parmod Shah v. Union of India reported in
2008(3) R.C.R.(Criminal) 191. The ground was that the PWDV Act, 2005 provided protection only
to women and not to men. The DB of the Hon'ble Delhi Court while upholding the vires of the
PWDV Act,2005 held:
"Domestic violence is a worldwide phenomenon and has been discussed in
international fora, including the Vienna Accord of 1994 and the Beijing Declaration
and the Platform for Action (1995). The United Nations Committee Convention on
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against women (CEDAW) has
recommended that States should act to protect women against violence of any kind,
especially that occurring within the family. There is a perception, not unfounded or
unjustified, that the lot and fate of women in India is an abjectly dismal one, which
requires bringing into place, on an urgent basis, protective and ameliorative
measures against exploitation of women. The argument that the Act is ultra vires the
Constitution of India because it accords protection only to women and not to men is,
therefore, wholly devoid of any merit. We do not rule out the possibility of a man
becoming the victim of domestic violence , but such cases would be few and far
between, thus not requiring or justifying the protection of Parliament."
25) CHAPTER IV of the PWDV Act, 2005 deals with the PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING ORDERS
OF RELIEFS. The provision of S.12 of the said Act empowers the Magistrate to deal with the
application under S.12 of the PWDV Act, 2005 and is worded thus:
) The vs . on 27 July, 2010
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9120615/
9
Application to Magistrate.−(1) An aggrieved person or a Protection Officer or any
other person on behalf of the aggrieved person may present an application to the
Magistrate seeking one or Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. more reliefs under
this Act:
Provided that before passing any order on such application, the Magistrate shall take
into consideration any domestic incident report received by him from the Protection
Officer or the service provider.
(2) The relief sought for under sub−section (1) may include a relief for issuance of an
order for payment of compensation or damages without prejudice to the right of such
person to institute a suit for compensation or damages for the injuries caused by the
acts of domestic violence committed by the respondent:
Provided that where a decree for any amount as compensation or damages has been
passed by any court in favour of the aggrieved person, the amount, if any, paid or
payable in pursuance of the order made by the Magistrate under this Act shall be set
off against the amount payable under such decree and the decree shall,
notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908),
or any other law for the time being in force, be executable for the balance amount, if
any, left after such set off.
(3) Every application under sub−section (1) shall be in such form and contain such
particulars as may be prescribed or as nearly as possible thereto.
(4) The Magistrate shall fix the first date of hearing, which shall not ordinarily be
beyond three days from the date of receipt of the application by the court. (5) The
Magistrate shall Endeavour to dispose of every application made under sub−section
(1) within a period of sixty days from the date of its first hearing.
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc.
26) The provision of S.12 of the PWDV Act, 2005 speaks of 'one or more reliefs under
this Act' which refers further to the other provisions providing various reliefs. The
applicant herein has sought various reliefs mentioned in the provisions from S.18 to
S.22 of the said Act. For granting such relief under S.12 PWDV Act, 2005 it is
essential to first see whether 'domestic violence' has been perpetuated. The PWDV
Act, 2005 defines domestic violence in S.3 (Ch. II) thus:
For the purposes of this Act, any act, omission or commission or conduct of the
respondent shall constitute domestic violence in case it −
(a) harms or injures or endangers the health, safety, life, limb or well−being, whether
mental or physical, of the aggrieved person or tends to do so and includes causing

10
physical abuse, sexual abuse, verbal and emotional abuse and economic abuse; or
(b) harasses, harms, injures or endangers the aggrieved person with a view to coerce
her or any other person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any dowry or
other property or valuable security; or
(c) has the effect of threatening the aggrieved person or any person related to her by
any conduct mentioned in clause (a) or clause (b); or
(d) otherwise injures or causes harm, whether physical or mental, to the aggrieved
person.
Explanation I.−For the purposes of this section,−
(i) "physical abuse" means any act or conduct which is of such a nature as to cause bodily pain,
harm, or danger to life, limb, or health or impair the health or development of the aggrieved person
and includes assault, criminal intimidation and criminal force;
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc.
(ii) "sexual abuse" includes any conduct of a sexual nature that abuses, humiliates, degrades or
otherwise violates the dignity of woman;
(iii) "verbal and emotional abuse" includes−
(a) insults, ridicule, humiliation, name calling and insults or ridicule specially with regard to not
having a child or a male child; and
(b) repeated threats to cause physical pain to any person in whom the aggrieved person is
interested.
(iv) "economic abuse" includes−
(a) deprivation of all or any economic or financial resources to which the aggrieved person is
entitled under any law or custom whether payable under an order of a court or otherwise or which
the aggrieved person requires out of necessity including, but not limited to, household necessities
for the aggrieved person and her children, if any, stridhan, property, jointly or separately owned by
the aggrieved person, payment of rental related to the shared household and maintenance;
(b) disposal of household effects, any alienation of assets whether movable or immovable, valuables,
shares, securities, bonds and the like or other property in which the aggrieved person has an interest
or is entitled to use by virtue of the domestic relationship or which may be reasonably required by
the aggrieved person or her children or her stridhan or any other property jointly or separately held
by the aggrieved person; and Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc.

11
(c) prohibition or restriction to continued access to resources or facilities which the aggrieved
person is entitled to use or enjoy by virtue of the domestic relationship including access to the
shared household.
Explanation II.−For the purpose of determining whether any act, omission, commission or conduct
of the respondent constitutes "domestic violence" under this section, the overall facts and
circumstances of the case shall be taken into consideration.
27) The definition of 'domestic violence' is widespread and overlaps with the definition of 'cruelty' as
provided under S.498−A IPC. Therefore, a demand of dowry would both be a penal offence as well
as a domestic violence. The prescription provided under the IPC is the 'imprisonment' up−to three
years whereas under the PWDV Act, 2005 the remedy provided is more of civil in nature. It was
observed by the HON'BLE MADHYA PRADESH HIGH COURT in "Ajay Kant v. Alka Sharma"
reported in 2008 CRI. L. J. 264 that basically the act has been passed to provide the
civil remedy against domestic violence to the women. However, as provided by
Sections 27 and 28 of the Act, a Judicial Magistrate of the first class or the
Metropolitan Magistrate has been empowered to grant a protection order and other
orders and to try the offence under the Act. Vide Section 28 of the Act, it is
mentioned that save as otherwise provided in this Act, all proceedings under Ss. 12,
18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 and the offences under Section 31 shall be governed by the
provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, Vide sub−sections 3 and 4 of
Section 19, it is also provided that a Magistrate may require from the respondent to
execute a bond, with or without sureties, for preventing the commission of domestic
violence and such order shall be deemed to be an order under Chapter VIII of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and shall be dealt with accordingly, Chapter VIII of
Cr. P.C. dealt with security for keeping peace and for good behavior which runs from
Sections 106 to 124. In Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. these Sections, it is
provided that for keeping the peace and maintaining good behavior, a person can be
directed by a Magistrate to execute a bond with or without sureties and in case of
non−compliance of such order, that person can be detained into custody. Section 31
of the Act provides penalty for breach of protection order passed by the Magistrate,
which is punishable as an offence.
28) We therefore find that though the PWDV Act, 2005 primarily addresses a civil
remedy, the procedure adopted is that of the criminal procedure. That is not unusual
as the provision of S.125 Cr.P.C. too, operates in the same fashion. The civil remedy
under the PWDV Act, 2005 ranges from providing damages to injunctions. The said
act does not provide for the punishment such as imprisonment or fine etc. The
PWDV Act, 2005 also does not define 'domestic violence' as a new 'offence'
altogether.
It is a different matter that S.31 PWDV Act, 2005 does prescribe breach of protection order by
respondent as a cognizable offence.

12
29) The provision of S.3(a) & (b) relates to the 'dangers' to the health, safety, life, limb or well−
being, whether mental or physical, of the aggrieved person. The provision of S.3(c) relates to the
threat to the aggrieved person by any conduct as mentioned in S.3(a) or S.3 (b). Therefore not only
the actual harassment is covered but any act, omission or commission or conduct of the respondent
having the effect of causing such a harassment shall constitute domestic violence. The terms like
'dowry' are also included in the definition. Here I would like to point out one more intricacy as far as
the illegal demand (of dowry is concerned). The term 'dowry' has not been used in the provision of
S.498−A I.P.C. but S.3 of the PWDV Act, 2005 does use the term 'dowry'. Another intricacy relates
to the fabric of the offence inasmuch as the S.498−A I.P.C. being a criminal offence needs evidence
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. beyond the reasonable doubt whereas under S.3 PWDV
Act,2005 the illegal demand may be proved by merely indicating the effect of any act, omission or
commission or conduct of the respondent. The civil remedy of 'dowry' as the 'domestic violence'
under the PWDV Act,2005 is thus differentiated from the criminal justice of 'illegal demand' under
the I.P.C. It is also for the said reason that any decision under the PWDV Act vis−à−vis 'dowry'
ought not affect the decision given under the criminal proceedings such as S.498−A I.P.C.
30) The 'domestic violence' is drafted to have included physical abuse, sexual abuse, verbal &
emotional abuse and economic abuse. As far as the evidence of the perpetration of 'domestic
violence' in the present case concerned the same has to be gauged in terms of the principles of legal
proof. The applicant−aggrieved herein has averred physical violence against her. The applicant−
aggrieved had filed the list of dowry articles before the CAW Cell which is annexed as Annexure−P4
and has been exhibited as Ex.CW−1/4. The complaints were made from time to the police. The
particular incidence of 06.10.2006 has been narrated in detail by the applicant where she was
beaten up. The applicant ran out of the house to rescue herself and reached the public road.
Meanwhile, the mother− in−law of the applicant came and snatched the baby which the applicant
was carrying. Before the applicant could have had recourse to the police authorities the respondent
No.1 called the PCR van so that a false case could be registered against the applicant. By now the
applicant had received much physical injuries leading to the swelling in the left forearm and the
wrist. The police arrived but would not listen to the applicant. No FIR was registered against the
applicant. On 07.10.2006 the applicant gave a complaint in writing to the police narrating the
incidence. The applicant was sent for a medical check−up on 07.10.2006. The younger child's
custody was restored to the applicant and she was sent to AIIMS for her medical check−up on
11.10.2006 where she was treated. Meanwhile the parents of the applicant−aggrieved pursued the
matter with the senior police officer Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. and got the FIR No. 840
/ 2006 u/s 323, 34, 406, 498−A, 506 of IPC registered against the respondents. The medical reports
are annexed as Annexure P−6 and the copy of the same have been exhibited as Ex. CW−1/6. The
said medical report reflects that the injuries were due to 'assault by the husband'. That goes to say
that the applicant while reporting the matter to the doctor gave the information that it is her
husband who did it. The sais stand was not changed even in the averments made in her application
under S.12 of PWDV, Act 2005 which was filed on 14.12.2007. The evidence seems credible and
trustworthy.
31) Sir Alfred Wills in his admirable book Wills' Circumstantial Evidence (Chapter VI) has laid down
certain rules regarding the burden of proof. The above principles have been duly incorporated in the
) The vs . on 27 July, 2010
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9120615/
13
provisions of S.101 and s.102 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. Two essential rules are :
"(1) the facts alleged as the basis of any legal inference must be clearly proved
connected with the factum probandum;
(2) the burden of proof is always on the party who asserts the existence of any fact,
which infers legal accountability."
32) The given segment of evidence encompasses the incidence particularly the one which had
occurred on 06.10.2006. The legal burden to introduce the said segment of evidence was on the
applicant. She did it. The mere introducing was not enough for her to have a decision. A fair support
of documents was required. The applicant did that as well. The issue of domestic violence became
very much alive and relevant in order to attract judicial deliberations. It was fairly established that
the domestic violence happened. The next step was to demolish the case put by the applicant. This
could only have been done through the cross−examination. The opportunity was indeed granted to
the Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. respondents but they never availed it. The applicant
herein discharged her burden and the respondent did not offer any evidence to counter or negate
the evidence of the applicant. This is how the applicant succeeded in establishing the fact dated
06.10.2006 and the series of facts thereafter. The narrated incidence depicts act or conduct (of such
a nature as to cause bodily pain, harm, or danger to life, limb, or health or impair the health or
development of the aggrieved herein) and is supported by the documents and has been clearly
established by her in her evidence.
33) As far as the sexual abuse is concerned the ingredients as per S.3 PWDV Act, 2005 includes any
conduct of a sexual nature that abuses, humiliates, degrades or otherwise violates the dignity of
woman. The applicant−aggrieved herein has not made any averments of that sort.
34) As far as "verbal and emotional abuse" abuses are concerned the applicant−aggrieved herein has
narrated incidences when she was insulted and ridiculed for bringing less dowry. The applicant was
tricked to give a favorable statement during the proceedings to have the FIR No. 392 of 2003
quashed. The FIR instituted by her were quashed. However, the respondents again resumed to
torture her. As a matter of fact the incident dated 06.01.2006 occurred when the FIR No.392 of
2003 were already quashed and the applicant was hoping a happy marital life. There is something
intriguing about the terms 'verbal' & 'emotional' being used together. The term 'verbal' typifies a
louder abuse - in tone. The 'emotional' abuse on the other hand is more characterized by 'silence'.
However both sorts of such abuses are mutually co−existing and the learned legislatures were sharp
enough to use the combination of 'verbal and 'emotional' together. In the present case it is not
denied by the respondents that the applicant−abused is living separately from the respondents.
Living separately:
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. either by choice or by compulsion, is an emotional abuse.
Another aspect of the emotional abuse happens to be the relationship of respondent No.1 with Ms.
Punam. I therefore hold that the emotional abuse stands established so far it relates to the inflicting
of the physical violence which resulted in the physical injuries sustained by the applicant.

35) As far as the economic abuse is concerned it would be relevant to state that this is the sort of
abuse which is the most prevalent. According to a research "Abuse in Intimate Relationships :
Defining the Multiple Dimensions and Terms. National Violence Against Women Prevention" by
Vera E. Mouradian, PhD. Batterers control victims' finances to prevent them from accessing
resources, working or maintaining control of earnings, achieving self−sufficiency, and gaining
financial independence. In another report "The Battered Women's Justice Project, Civil Office" by
Christine Thomas (Staff Attorney, BWJP Civil Office, June 2004) it has been observed:
"Because economic dependence and severe financial stress on abused women can so
acutely impact a survivor's choice to stay or leave an abusive relationship and because
economic abuse by batterers is often an aspect of the power and control over their
lives, stronger legal advocacy for economic safety and restitution is important to the
economic empowerment of battered women and the goal of assuring that women
may live free of violence and oppression by their intimate partners. The economic
relief available through a protection order may be an essential temporary mechanism
to ensure safety and promote economic justice for the survivor."
36) The above−mentioned report also stated that effective strategies to end violence against women
must include strong measures that promote economic security and restitution for survivors. Many
women Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. are compelled to stay in abusive relationships or
return to their batterers because of financial constraints and economic concerns. Moreover,
protection order proceedings are an appropriate and necessary venue to address the economic
injustice that often characterizes domestic violence. It is pertinent to acknowledge that even in the
most developed countries like the USA there are strong economic provisions for the women. For
instance, child support and/or temporary spousal maintenance awards are specifically authorized by
most state statutes; typically, these forms of emergency financial support to survivors and their
children can be obtained in protection order proceedings.
37) The PWDV Act,2005 is a legislation aimed at strengthening the economic independence of a
woman and therefore includes the aspect 'financial deprivation to the women' in the category of
'economic abuse'. Economic abuse can manifest itself in many different ways, and abusers can
victimize their partners even after they have left the abusive relationship. The PWDV Act, 2005, has
perceived that a woman needs 'economic' contribution from her husband in the light of 'domestic
violence'. The said Act is law which provides for more effective protection of the rights of women
guaranteed under the Constitution who are victims of violence of any kind occurring within the
family and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. In the present case it is not
disputed that the child is being brought up by the applicant−aggrieved single handedly and any
economic deprivation to the child (in which the applicant is certainly interested) is the economic
deprivation of the applicant.
38) In the present case there happens to be the most elaborated averment with in regard to
'stridhan' of the applicant−aggrieved. It has been deposed by CW−1 that all the articles have not
been returned to her. When the FIR No.392/2003, under Section 498−A/406 IPC, was registered at
Police Station Defence Colony the Sessions Court had granted the anticipatory bail to the accused on

the condition Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. that Rs.50,000/− would be given to the
applicant herein. The amount of Rs.50,000/− was returned by the applicant herein to the
respondents to improve the relations. The applicant herein did what the respondents wanted her to
do in order to save her marriage. The issue of the wrongful retaining of Stridhan and the amount of
Rs.50,000/− is certainly an economic abuse if proved. The sort of evidence that was required was
the examination of the father who purportedly played part in returning the money to the
respondents. That has not been done. The sole evidence that we have is the averment of the
applicant. Certain dowry articles were also allegedly retuned by the applicant herein to the
respondents. The amount of Rs.50,000/− was received by the applicant herein from her father vide
receipt annexed as Annexure P−5A. It is relevant to hold that the receipt that is being mentioned of
is the one which was issued by the applicant and not the respondent. Moreover, the said receipt has
not been exhibited and proved. The applicant herein has not been able to discharge that initial
burden of establishing the particular fact of giving the The amount of Rs.50,000/− to the
respondents. The economic abuse regarding the stridhan and the amount of Rs.50,000/− is not
established.
THE RELIEF SOUGHT u/s 19 of the PWDV Act,2005
39) The provision of S.19 essentially deals with the Residence orders:
"(1) While disposing of an application under sub−section (1) of section 12, the
Magistrate may, on being satisfied that domestic violence has taken place, pass a
residence order −
(a) restraining the respondent from dispossessing or in any other manner disturbing
the possession of the aggrieved person from the shared household, whether or not the
respondent has a legal or equitable interest in the shared household;
(b) directing the respondent to remove himself from the shared household;
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc.
(c) restraining the respondent or any of his relatives from entering any portion of the
shared household in which the aggrieved person resides;
(d) restraining the respondent from alienating or disposing off the shared household
or encumbering the same;
(e) restraining the respondent from renouncing his rights in the shared household
except with the leave of the Magistrate; or
(f) directing the respondent to secure same level of alternate accommodation for the
aggrieved person as enjoyed by her in the shared household or to pay rent for the
same, if the circumstances so require:

Provided that no order under clause (b) shall be passed against any person who is a
woman.
(2) The Magistrate may impose any additional conditions or pass any other direction
which he may deem reasonably necessary to protect or to provide for the safety of the
aggrieved person or any child of such aggrieved person.
(3) The Magistrate may require from the respondent to execute a bond, with or
without sureties, for preventing the commission of domestic violence. (4) An order
under sub−section (3) shall be deemed to be an order under Chapter VIII of the Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) and shall be dealt with accordingly. (5) While
passing an order under sub−section (1), sub−section (2) or sub−section (3), the court
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. may also pass an order directing the officer in
charge of the nearest police station to give protection to the aggrieved person or to
assist her or the person making an application on her behalf in the implementation of
the order.
(6) While making an order under sub−section (1), the Magistrate may impose on the
respondent obligations relating to the discharge of rent and other payments, having
regard to the financial needs and resources of the parties.
(7) The Magistrate may direct the officer in−charge of the police station in whose
jurisdiction the Magistrate has been approached to assist in the implementation of
the protection order. (8) The Magistrate may direct the respondent to return to the
possession of the aggrieved person her stridhan or any other property or valuable
security to which she is entitled to."
40) The relief(s) u/s 19 PWDV which have been sought the applicant herein are :
i. The residence orders u/s 19 of PWDV Act, 2005 thereby directing the respondents
to provide the applicant with the same level of residence as enjoyed by her when she
lived with the respondent No.1;
ii. The directions to the respondents to return the stridhan of the applicant to her. In
case the said stridhan and articles are not returned the applicant has sought an
additional compensation of Rs.12 Lacs;
41) The S. 19(1) (f) PWDV Act, 2005 provides that on being satisfied that domestic
violence has been perpetrated on the aggrieved woman the magistrate may direct the
respondent to secure same level of Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. alternate
accommodation for the aggrieved person as enjoyed by her in the shared household
or to pay rent for the same, if the circumstances so require. There is no doubt that the
said provision is aims at securing a shelter over the head of a woman either in the
shared household or elsewhere. The responsibility to do so is fastened on the
) The vs . on 27 July, 2010
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9120615/
17
respondents.
42) The kind of proof that was required on part of the applicant was the proof of the
level of accommodation that she had enjoyed in the shared household. There
happens to be no cogent evidence with that regard. An inference can only by drawn
from the overall financial position of the respondents. The mere averments would
show that the respondents are enjoying a comfortable life style. The provision of
S.19(6) empowers the magistrate to impose on the respondent obligations relating to
the discharge of rent and other payments, having regard to the financial needs and
resources of the parties.
43) It is pertinent to see that even before the advent of the Act, the right of a wife to
reside in the matrimonial home, was recognized as part of her right to maintenance,
in so far as Hindus are concerned. In para−12 of its judgment in B.P. Achala Anand v.
S. Appi Reddy and Another, 2005(3) SCC 313, the Supreme Court laid down the law
on the point as follows :
"A Hindu wife is entitled to be maintained by her husband. She is entitled to remain
under his roof and protection. She is also entitled to separate residence if by reason of
the husband's conduct or by his refusal to maintain her in his own place of residence
or for other just cause Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. she is compelled to live
apart from him. Right to residence is a part and parcel of wife's right to maintenance.
The right to maintenance cannot be defeated by the husband executing a Will to
defeat such a right. (See Mulla : Principles of Hindu Law, Vol. I, 18th Edn., 2001,
paras 554 and 555). The right has come to be statutorily recognised with the
enactment of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956. Section 18 of the Act
provides for maintenance of wife. Maintenance has been so defined in clause (b) of
Section 3 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 as to include therein
provision for residence amongst other things. For the purpose of maintenance the
term "wife" includes a divorced wife."
44) In the paragraph No. 17 of the petition filed by the respondent0husband it has been admitted
that the respondent herein had a sound financial background. The applicant herein cannot be
expected to stay in her father's house indefinitely. She is also entitled to separate residence if by
reason of the husband's conduct or by his refusal to maintain her in his own place of residence or for
other just cause she is compelled to live apart from him.
45) In the present case it has already been held that the domestic violence stands established by the
applicant particularly with respect to the incidence of physical injuries inflicted upon her body on
06.10.2006. That is sufficient reason for her to stay in a separate residence. I therefore direct the
respondents to pay a monthly rent of Rs.10,000/− (Rupees Ten Thousand) so that the applicant
could arrange for her accommodation.

46) The facts relating to the 'stridhan' articles essentially involve the factum of 'possession' of the
movable articles. The expression "possession" is a legal term and its proof varies with the nature of
property under the scrutiny of the courts and it can be proved by credible oral evidence as well. The
expression "Evidence" has been defined under Section 3 of the Evidence Act which means and
includes all statements which Courts permit or require to be made before it by witnesses in relation
to matters of fact under inquiry such statements are called oral evidence. The testimony of a reliable
witnesses about the possession cannot be brushed aside by giving superficial treatment or by
ignoring it. The Courts are required to weigh to the oral testimony adduced by the parties and its
ignorance would be treated to be fatal. In abundant caution, it is held that Courts while analysing
oral statements of the witnesses are required to keep in view the statements of those witnesses who
had deposed the acts of possession leading to an inference about possession of a party according to
the nature of the property under consideration in preference to the statements of the witnesses who
had stated only about possession simpliciter without stating any act of possession in favour of one
party or other. (see AIR 1997 RAJ. 230 "Kanti Lal v. Shanti Devi").
47) Although the applicant herein has filed the list of dowry articles before the CAW Cell which is
Annexure−P4 and has been exhibited as Ex.CW−1/4. However, the mere list would not prove the
possession. The handing over of the dowry articles is that segment of fact which should have been
brought out clearly by the applicant herein. In the Indian culture the actual delivery of the
possession of the dowry articles is done either by the father/son or by any concerned person who
could even be a relative. A bride sits pretty in the marriage while the arrangements etc. are made.
She only has an idea what she would take in her matrimonial house. That is to say that she does not
have the best knowledge of what she carries. The actual knowledge could only be provided by the
father / brother / relative etc. who handed the possession. It is for this reason that when a list of
dowry articles is Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. prepared the same ought to be signed and
countersigned by the giver and the taker. I can understand that this could appear a bit awkward at
the time of the marriage but the courts can come to definite conclusion only after being satisfied of
the 'possession' by one evidence or the other. Even the oral testimonies of the persons would do. It is
for this reason that I am skeptic of relying solely on the oral testimony of the applicant herein. The
sole oral evidence of the applicant (CW−1) is not able preponderate the probability.
48) There happens to be other difficulty in granting the relief of the recovery of the 'stridhan'. The
recovery has to be specific and so has to be evidence otherwise great difficulty arises in
implementing the same. The applicant has not been able to adduce that precise evidence which
could lead her to have the said relief. The ration in the judgment AIR 1997 RAJ. 230 "Kanti Lal v.
Shanti Devi" could not come to the rescue of the applicant. The rigors of the legal proof ought be
undergone in order to establish a particular fact. The prayer of the applicant with respect to the
restoring of the stridhan articles is declined.
49) However, I would caution myself in commenting more on the aspect of 'stridhan' a criminal
proceeding' is also pending u/s 406 IPC. I have only held on the basis of the requirements of the
PWDV Act, 2005.

50) Now I come to the monetary relief(s) to the applicant−aggrieved. The scheme of the PWDV Act,
2005 does provide for the interim monthly relief as well as the compensation & monetary damages
to the said applicant. According to S.20 of the PWDV Act, 2005:
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. (1) While disposing of an application under sub−section (1)
of section 12, the Magistrate may direct the respondent to pay monetary relief to meet the expenses
incurred and losses suffered by the aggrieved person and any child of the aggrieved person as a
result of the domestic violence and such relief may include, but not limited to,−
(a) the loss of earnings;
(b) the medical expenses;
(c) the loss caused due to the destruction, damage or removal of any property from the control of the
aggrieved person; and
(d) the maintenance for the aggrieved person as well as her children, if any, including an order
under or in addition to an order of maintenance under section 125 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) or any other law for the time being in force. (2) The monetary relief
granted under this section shall be adequate, fair and reasonable and consistent with the standard of
living to which the aggrieved person is accustomed. (3) The Magistrate shall have the power to order
an appropriate lump sum payment or monthly payments of maintenance, as the nature and
circumstances of the case may require. (4) The Magistrate shall send a copy of the order for
monetary relief made under sub−section (1) to the parties to the application and to the in charge of
the police station within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the respondent resides.
(5) The respondent shall pay the monetary relief granted to the aggrieved person within the Ms.
Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. period specified in the order under sub−section (1).
(6) Upon the failure on the part of the respondent to make payment in terms of the order under
sub−section (1), the Magistrate may direct the employer or a debtor of the respondent, to directly
pay to the aggrieved person or to deposit with the court a portion of the wages or salaries or debt
due to or accrued to the credit of the respondent, which amount may be adjusted towards the
monetary relief payable by the respondent.
51) The provision of S.20 PWDV Act,2005 deals with the monetary relief. It speaks of "monetary
relief to meet the expenses incurred and losses suffered by the aggrieved person and any child of the
aggrieved person as a result of the domestic violence." The monetary relief under S.20 thus takes
adequate care of the reality that an aggrieved−woman may have to bring up the children on her own.
However, the provision is characterized by two relevant factors:
i. the expenses incurred and ;
) The vs . on 27 July, 2010
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9120615/
20
ii. the losses suffered by the aggrieved person and any child of the aggrieved person
as a result of the domestic violence.
52) The losses as prescribed include the loss of earnings; the medical expenses; the
loss caused due to the destruction, damage or removal of any property from the
control of the aggrieved person. The evidence that was required on part of the
applicant was to establish that the appropriate facts with respect to the losses as
mentioned under S.20 PWDV Act, 2005. The applicant had merely averred Ms.
Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. and deposed the financial status of the
respondents. The said provision is based on specific reimbursement rather than
general monetary maintenance. The applicant has sought Rs. Rs.25,000 per month
and the following prayer(s) which apparently fall under S.20 PWDV Act, 2005 and
the litigation cost of Rs.10,000/−
53) There can be no doubt that S.20(3) empowers the to order an appropriate lump
sum payment or monthly payments of maintenance, as the nature and circumstances
of the case may require.
Therefore the piece of evidence that would be required on part of the applicant herein in order
establish the monetary claim under S.20 is the elaboration of the expenses required and the loses
suffered. The only loss averred is that of Rs.10,000/− on the litigation. As far as the monthly
monetary relief is concerned the principle is that the sum so granted must be reasonable and
consistent with the standard of living to which the aggrieved person is accustomed. In Bhagwan v.
Kamla Devi (AIR 1975 SC 83) it was observed that the wife should be in a position to maintain
standard of living which is neither luxurious nor penurious but what is consistent with status of a
family. The applicant has admitted that she is getting some maintenance under S.125 Cr.P.C.
According to S.20 PWDV Act, 2005 the magistrate may still grant an additional maintenance
depending on the facts of the case. The applicant has asked for Rs.25,000/− per month
54) The term `maintenance' is defined in Black's Law Dictionary, (6th Edn. pp.953−54) thus; "The
furnishing by one person to another, for his or her support, of the means of living, or food, clothing,
shelter, etc., particularly where the legal relation of the parties is such that one is bound to support
the other, as between father and child or husband and wife'`. For computing maintenance the
following test have been laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Jasbir Kaur Sehgal v. District
Judge, Dehradun and Ors., 1997 (7) SCC 7, wherein it has been observed that "No set formula can be
laid for fixing the amount of maintenance. It has, in the very Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc.
nature of things, to depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. Some scope for leverage
can, however, be always there. The court has to consider the status of the parties, their respective
needs, the capacity of the husband to pay having regard to his reasonable expenses for his own
maintenance and of those he is obliged under the law and statutory but involuntary payments or
deductions. The amount of maintenance fixed for the wife should be such as she can live in
reasonable comfort considering her status and the mode of life she was used to when she lived with
her husband and also that she does not feel handicapped in the prosecution of her case. At the same
time, the amount so fixed cannot be excessive or extortionate."

55) Considering the facts of the case I am inclined to grant a monthly maintenance of Rs.10,000/−
(Rupees Five Thousand) per month from the date of order after deducting the amount paid to the
applicant under the other litigations.
THE RELIEF SOUGHT u/s 22 of the PWDV Act,2005
56) Compensation to the victims of the crime is laso covered under S.357 of the Cr.P.C. In awarding
compensation, it is necessary for the Court to decide if the case is a fit one in which compensation
deserves to be awarded. If the Court is convinced that compensation should be paid, then quantum
of compensation is to be determined by taking into consideration the nature of the crime, the injury
suffered and the capacity of the convict to pay compensation etc. It goes without saying that the
amount of compensation has to be reasonable, which the person concerned is able to pay. If the
accused is not in a position to pay the compensation to the injured or his dependents to which they
are held to be entitled to, there could be no reason for the Court to direct such compensation.
(Sarwan Singh and Ors. Vs. St. of Punjab AIR 1978 SC 1525 : 2 (1978) 4 SCC 111 Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh.
Durgesh Mishra etc.
57) In Dilip S. Dahanukar Vs. Kotak Mahindra Co. Ltd. and Anr. [(2007) 6 SCC 528] explaining the
scope and the purpose of imposition of fine and/or grant of compensation, it was observed that the
purpose of imposition of fine and/ or grant of compensation to a great extent must be considered
having the relevant factors therefore in mind. It may be compensating the person in one way or the
other. The amount of compensation sought to be imposed, thus, must be reasonable and not
arbitrary. Before issuing a direction to pay compensation, the capacity of accused to pay the same
must be judged. A fortiori, an enquiry in this behalf even in a summary way may be necessary. Some
reasons, which may not be very elaborate, may also have to be assigned; the purpose being that
whereas the power to impose fine is limited and direction to pay compensation can be made for one
or the other, factors enumerated out of the same; but S.357(3) does not impose any such limitation
and power there−under should be exercised only in appropriate cases. Such a jurisdiction cannot be
exercised at the whims and caprice of a Judge.
58) As far as the monetary relief under S.22 PWDV Act, 2005 is concerned the same deals with
compensatory orders and says:"In addition to other reliefs as may be granted under this Act, the
Magistrate may on an application being made by the aggrieved person, pass an order directing the
respondent to pay compensation and damages for the injuries, including mental torture and
emotional distress, caused by the acts of domestic violence committed by that respondent."
59) The compensation provided under S.22 is a onetime payment in addition to the payment
(monthly or lump−sum) granted under S.20 of the PWDV Act,2005. The scheme of the said act
covers the aspect of human agony and also uses the terminology of 'damages' which is usually used
in the Indian Contract Act, 1872. However, the commercial transactions under the contractual
obligations give little significance to the human agony. For instance the illustration (n) appended
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. to S.73 of the Indian Contract Act, 1972 says: "A contracts to
pay a sum of money to B on a day specified. A does not pay the money on that day; B, in
consequence of not receiving the money on that day, is unable to pay his debts, and is totally ruined.
) The vs . on 27 July, 2010
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9120615/
22
A is not liable to make good to B anything except the principal sum he contracted to pay, together
with interest up to the day of payment."
60) The human agony of a trader being ruined by the untimely payment of money from his debtor
attracts no more remedy than the mere principle amount along−with the interest. In the commercial
transaction the damages must have been arisen naturally in the usual course of things from such
breach, or which the parties knew, when they made the contract, to be likely to result from the
breach of it. The provision under S.22 PWDV Act, 2005 though speaks of 'damages' and
'compensation', there happens to be a human touch to it. The said human touch is further
strengthened by the fact that no statutory device has been provided in order to gauge the said
damage. It is even more human that the provision of S.20 of the PWDV Act, 2005 which is guided by
the loss of earning etc. Now the question is what amount is deserved by the applicant in the present
case in the circumstances where in particular the emotional & economical abuses stand reasonable
established.
61) The statute PWDV Act,2005 uses two terms together i.e. 'compensation' and 'damages' and by
using two terms together the legislators have imported the concept of compensatory damages and
the punitive damages which could deter the respondent from committing a similar action in the
future. The ingredients of the measure of such compensation & damages are roughly enumerated as
in terms of: the injuries, including mental torture and emotional distress. There is however no test
provided. How can the mental torture and the emotional distress be proved? It has been held in AIR
1973 Delhi 200 that it may safely be stated that any conduct of the husband which causes disgrace to
the wife or subjects her to a course of annoyance and indignity amounts to legal cruelty. Proof
beyond Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc. reasonable doubt is not postulated where human
relationship is involved and eye−witnesses are difficult to obtain. Similar proposition was laid down
in Shobha Rani v. Madhukar Reddi, AIR 1988 SC 121. As far as 'emotional distress' is concerned the
said terminology is more akin to torts. While granting damages there are 'mitigation rules' whereas
in 'emotional distress' there happens to be no mitigation rules particularly when one is dealing with
the human relations out of matrimony and the likes. By combining 'damages' with 'emotional
distress' the provision of S.22 of the PWDV Act, 2005 thus seems to have enunciated the concept of
'matrimonial tort'. Courts have awarded damages for emotional distress primarily when the
'physical injury' has resulted and not otherwise. Originally at common law, a plaintiff could not
recover for physical injury from fright alone absent an impact even though the defendant was shown
to have operated a railroad negligently (shock without impact). In an English case Victorian
Railways Commissioners v. Coultas [(1888) 13 AC 222] a woman was barred from recovery due to
shock despite suffering a miscarriage. Even with intentional conduct, absent material damage,
claims for emotional harm were similarly barred. "Mental pain or anxiety, the law cannot value, and
does not pretend to redress, when the unlawful act causes that alone. Courts had been reluctant to
accept a tort for emotional harm for fear of opening a "wide door"
to frivolous claims. [Mitchell v. Rochester Railway Co. 151 NY 107 (1896)]. The idea
that shock without impact would be a bar to recovery was first questioned at the
Queen's Bench in Pugh v. London etc. Railroad Co.([1896] 2 QB 248. )

62) The PWDV Act, 2005 has added 'mental torture' thereby clarifying that 'mental
injury' is as much the part of 'emotional distress'. The definition of 'emotional
distress' is thus expanded under the PWDV Act, 2005. This expanded definition finds
great support from the recently developed concept of Intentional infliction of
emotional distress (IIED) which is a tort that results in extreme emotional distress.
Some jurisdictions refer to it as the tort of outrage.
Ms. Yogita Vs. Sh. Durgesh Mishra etc.
63) In matrimonial cases the very domestic violence would cause mental distress
whether physical abuse is inflicted or not. The physical abuse would add to emotional
distress. The PWDV Act, 2005 addresses such emotional distress by providing for the
damages to the aggrieved woman. The measure of the damages could well be done by
the general principles of applying test of directness while not relying too much upon
the remote possibilities even if human agony is considered. Compensation can assist
women to deal with the aftermath of violence at both a practical and symbolic level.
The applicant−aggrieved has been able to establish the physical abuse and has sought
Rs.10 Lakh as compensation and damages. After going through the whole evidence
and the overall circumstances I am inclined to grant the damages and compensation
of Rs.1 Lakh to the applicant−aggrieved.

THE CHALLENGE
1. Present writ petitions have been filed challenging the constitutional validity of
Section 171 of the Central Good and Services Tax Act, 2017 (for short 'Act, 2017') and
Rules 122, 124, 126, 127, 129, 133 and 134 of the Central Good and Services Tax Rules,
2017 (for short 'Rules, 2017') as well as legality of the notices proposing imposition or
orders imposing penalty issued by the National Anti-Profiteering Authority ('NAA')
under Section 122 of the Act, 2017 read with Rule 133(3)(d) of the Rules, 2017 and
the final orders passed by NAA, whereby the petitioners, who are companies running
diverse businesses ranging from hospitality, Fast-Moving Consumer Goods ('FMCG')
to real estate, have been directed in accordance with Section 171 of Act, 2017, to pass
on the commensurate benefit of reduction in the rate of tax or the Input Tax Credit to

W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE
PETITIONERS
4. Mr. P. Chidambaram, Mr. S. Ganesh, Mr. Tarun Gulati, Mr. Chinmoy Pradip Sharma and
Mr.Pritesh Kapoor, learned Senior counsel as well as Mr. V. Lakshmikumaran, Mr. Monish Panda,
Mr. Rohan Shah, Mr. Abhishek A. Rastogi, Mr. Tushar Jarwal, Mr. Sparsh Bhargava, Mr. Puneet
Aggarwal, Mr. Sujit Ghosh, Mr. K. S. Suresh, Mr. Nikhil Gupta, Mr. Shashank Shekhar and Mr.
Priyadarshi Manish, learned counsel addressed arguments on behalf of the petitioners.
5. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that Section 171(1) of the Act, 2017 and the Rules
126, 127 and 133 of the Rules, 2017 framed thereunder are unconstitutional as they are beyond the
legislative competence of Parliament. They submitted that the impugned provisions do not fall
within the law-making power of Parliament under Article 246A of the Constitution of India.
6. Some of the learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the anti- profiteering provision, as
provided under Section 171 of the Act, 2017, is in the nature of a tax or financial exaction. They
submitted that a tax can be levied from a subject only if there is a specific and unequivocal provision
in the parent statute authorising such an exaction. According to them, such a financial exaction
cannot be made lawfully by a subordinate legislation, when there is no empowering provision in the
parent statute. In support of their submissions, they relied on the decisions of the Supreme Court in
Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority v. Sharakumar Jayantikumar Pasawala, (1992) 3 SCC
285 and V.V.S. Sugars v. Govt. of A.P., (1999) 4 SCC 192.
7. Learned counsel for the petitioners further submitted that the impugned Section and Rules suffer
from vice of excessive delegation as they delegate essential legislative functions to the Government.
Additionally, they submitted W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 that the
impugned provisions are ambiguous, arbitrary, violative of Article 14 and confer excessive powers
on NAA to determine profiteering as no guidelines and/or legislative policy for the exercise of such
powers by the authority so constituted have been laid down in the statute. They submitted that the
failure to provide clear statutory guidance for exercise of powers by NAA in the formulation of such
methodology amounts to "delegation of essential legislative function" as these formulations were
essential and therefore, the same should have been stipulated by the Legislature. They submitted
that it is settled law that the legislative authority cannot be delegated under a statute without
appropriate guidelines or safeguards. In support of their submissions, they relied on the judgment
of the Supreme Court in Ramesh Birch vs. Union of India, 1989 Supp SCC 430.
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
53
8. They submitted that it is settled law that delegatus non potest delegare which essentially means
that a delegatee cannot further delegate unless expressly or impliedly authorized. They contended
that the Legislature vide Section 171 of the Act, 2017 delegated the authority to determine/prescribe
powers and functions of NAA to the Executive i.e. the Government of India. They submitted that the
Government of India by way of Rule 126 of the Rules, 2017, contrary to the legislative mandate
contained in Section 171 of the Act, 2017, further delegated the power to NAA to determine the
methodology and procedure for determining whether the reduction in taxes or the benefit of Input
Tax Credit had been passed on to the recipients. They stated that even NAA did not issue any
guidelines as to how to determine profiteering. In support of their submission, they relied on the
judgment of the Supreme Court in Barium Chemicals Ltd. & Ors. v Company Law Board & Ors. [AIR
1967 SC 295].
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
9. They submitted that the term 'commensurate' is not defined in the Act, 2017 and the expression
'profiteering' in Section 171 is dependent upon the scope and meaning of the phrase 'commensurate
reduction in the price'. According to them, as a result of this circular reasoning, NAA had complete
and unfettered discretion to determine the extent of profiteering. They pointed out that the
definition of profiteering inserted by way of amendment (that came into force only on 01st January,
2020) is vague and uncertain as to how the amount of profiteering or commensurate reduction in
price has to be determined and therefore, the same is ex facie arbitrary and violative of Articles 14
and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. They pointed out that even NAA, in the orders passed by it,
had not been consistent in its interpretation of the term "commensurate reduction".
10. They stated that without stipulating the specifics of the methodology to be adopted to determine
profiteering, the petitioners could not have been asked to reduce prices. They contrasted the lack of
guidelines in Section 171 of the Act, 2017 with Section 9A of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 which lays
down the broad guidelines on the basis of which the extent of dumping and anti-dumping duty is to
be quantified and Section 19(3) of the Competition Act, 2002, which lays down the factors to be
taken into consideration while determining whether an agreement has an appreciable adverse effect.
They stated that in the absence of any guidelines, NAA had acted arbitrarily as is evident from the
varied approaches taken by it while adjudicating cases of entities belonging to the same industry and
dealing with similar products.
11. Learned counsel for the petitioners emphasised that the formula used by the respondents, for
instance, for real estate companies during the course of investigation/adjudication, had not been
notified. They stated that the W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 methodology
adopted by NAA and the Director General of Anti-Profiteering ('DGAP') to arrive at the profiteering
amount of the real estate industry was generally based on the difference between the ratio of Input
Tax Credit to turnover under the pre-Goods and Services Tax and post-Goods and Services Tax
period. To drive home the point that the methodology adopted by the respondents was flawed, the
learned counsel for the petitioners gave an illustration of the contrasting results one would get after
calculating the amount profiteered/required to be passed on in case of two identical real estate
projects being developed by Developers A & B with the only difference being the advance payment
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
54
received by them prior to the Goods and Services Tax Regime. They stated that assuming that two
Developers (A & B) commenced construction of the two identical projects (having hundred flats of
rupees one crore each) in 2017 and the projects were executed at an identical pace with identical
inputs and with Developer A receiving sixty per cent of the amount (total sale price of the project) as
advance during the pre-Goods and Services Tax period, Developer B receiving only twenty per cent
as advance during that period, with all other factors being identical (like the credit availed/available
during the pre-Goods and Services Tax period), the credit to turnover ratio for the two projects
would vary drastically depending on the time when the payments from the customers were received.
According to the petitioners, if the methodology adopted by NAA /DGAP is to be accepted,
Developer A would be required to pass on 15% benefit to the flat- buyers and Developer B who
received 80% of the payment/amount post-Goods and Services Tax receive would be required to
pass no benefit to the flat-buyers. A graphical representation of the same, as furnished by the
petitioners, is as follows:
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
12. They stated that it is for this reason, the percentage of credit to turnover ratio (in Goods and
Services Tax regime) had varied from 0.2% (in Vatika Limited, Case No. 64/2019) to 20.98% (in
Emaar MGF Land Ltd, Case No. 26/2020) in the orders passed by NAA.
13. Learned counsel for the petitioners in Writ Petition No. 13657/2022 pointed out that DLF
calculated the total savings on account of introduction of Goods and Services Tax for each project.
He stated that the total savings/benefits were then divided by total area to arrive at the per square
feet benefit to be passed on to each flat buyer. He stated that as a result the flat-buyers with equal
area received equal benefit. In contrast to this, he pointed out that the NAA/DGAP calculated the
benefit by comparison of ratios as explained above and then computed the profiteered amount as a
percentage of consideration received from each flat-buyer in the Goods and Services Tax regime.
Therefore, as per NAA/DGAP, similarly placed flat-buyers received inconsistent benefits. For the
project Camellias, the benefits computed by both NAA/DGAP & DLF are tabulated below:

14. They also submitted that determination of profiteering can be made at different
levels such as entity level, Stock Keeping Unit (hereinafter referred to as 'SKU') level,
product level, customer level etc. Hence, an assessee intending to W.P.(C) 7743/2019
& other connected matters 18:24:48 comply with the law has no way of ensuring
whether its methodology is in compliance with Section 171(1) of the Act, 2017 or not.
15. Learned counsel for the petitioners also submitted that the operation of Section
171 of the Act, 2017 amounted to price-fixing and is therefore violative of Articles
19(1)(g) and 300A of the Constitution. They submitted that according to NAA's
interpretation of Section 171 of the Act, 2017, once any of the events contemplated in
Section 171 of the Act, 2017 occurs, i.e. either there is reduction in tax rate or benefit
of Input Tax Credit is availed, then the price of the product must be adjusted to (a)
the extent of the tax reduced and/or (b) the extent of increase in the credit
availability. They stated that there is no clarity on adjustments allowed on account of
rise either in input costs or in customs duty on import of inputs, supply and demand
conditions and other factors which impact pricing. They submitted that Section 171 of
the Act, 2017, to the extent it eliminates all factors from consideration in price
fixation, other than the rate of tax and credit availability, was clearly excessive,
disproportionate and unwarranted.
16. They pointed out that similar anti-profiteering provisions had been introduced in
Australia (in 2000) and in Malaysia (in 2015) to ensure that the benefit of reduction
of tax rate was passed on to the recipients. They stated that the provisions so
introduced prescribed clear policy guidelines before imposing the restrictive
conditions.
17. They stated that when Australia implemented the Goods and Services Tax
replacing the erstwhile Wholesale Sales Tax, the Australian Competition and
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024

56
Consumer Commission ('ACCC') was entrusted with the responsibility to oversee
pricing responses to the introduction of Goods and Services Tax for a period of three
years between 1999 and 2002. They stated that Section 75AU of W.P.(C) 7743/2019
& other connected matters 18:24:48 the Trade Practices Act, 1974 which prohibited
price exploitation in relation to the New tax System provided that factors such as
increase in supplier's input costs, supply and demand conditions and other relevant
factors shall be taken into consideration while determining price exploitation. They
further stated that Section 75AV(1) of the aforesaid Act provided that the ACCC must
formulate detailed guidelines to explain when prices may be regarded to be in
contravention of the price exploitation provision. They stated that the ACCC had
framed detailed guidelines in July, 1999 which were later revised in March, 2000
after taking inputs from all stakeholders. It was pointed out that the fundamental
principle laid down in the aforesaid guidelines was based on a 'net dollar margin
rule'. According to them, the said guidelines enumerated all the relevant factors to be
taken into consideration for price adjustments and provided for considering the
increase in procurement cost and additional costs due to the tax change. They stated
that it also allowed averaging the impact of taxes and costs across goods or services
under specific circumstances.
18. While referring to the Goods and Services Tax system introduced in Malaysia,
they stated that the Anti- Profiteering measures had been incorporated under the
Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act, 2011 to control prices of goods, charges of
services and to prohibit unreasonably high profiteering by suppliers. They stated that
making unreasonably high profit was an offence under Section 14 of the said Act.
They further stated that Section 15 of the said Act provided that the Minister shall
prescribe the mechanism to determine whether the profit is unreasonably high
considering different conditions and taking into consideration factors such as: tax
imposition, suppliers' cost, supply and demand conditions and other relevant matters
in relation or price of goods and services W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 etc. It was pointed out that detailed guidelines were laid down
under the Regulations issued in 2014 and 2016.
19. Learned counsel for the petitioners further submitted that Section 171 of the Act,
2017 is manifestly arbitrary and unreasonable, as it does not fix a period of time
during which the reduced prices of the goods and services had to be maintained. They
emphasised that the time-frame for which an assessee could be subject to the
discipline of Section 171 of the Act, 2017 has been left undefined and open-ended.
According to them, this indefinite obligation hinders the petitioners' right to trade
and commerce and hence, the same is violative of Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the
Constitution of India.
20. They further stated that price reduction is not the only method by which
commensurate benefit can be passed on to the recipient. They stated that an increase
in the volume or weight of the product being sold for the same price is an equally

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
57
effective and legal way of commensurately reducing the price of the product. They
stated that mandating price reduction as the only way to pass the commensurate
benefit to the recipient is manifestly arbitrary and unreasonable.
21. Learned counsel for the petitioner in W.P.(C) 12557/2022, M/s. L'Oreal India Pvt.
Ltd., stated that in the FMCG industry, for low priced products, since the resultant
reduction in price is often miniscule, it was not feasible to pass on the benefit because
of the restriction in the Legal Metrology Act, 2009 and Legal Metrology (Packaged
Commodities) Rules, 2011 that require the prices of the goods to be rounded off to
the nearest fifty paisa. In support of his contention, he referred to the following table:
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 Original MRP Price 18% GST
Ideal revised MRP exclusive of MRP suggested by 28% GST Respondent 5 3.90625/-
0.703125/- 4.609375/- 4.5/-
4 3.125/- 0.5625/- 3.6874/- 3.5/-
3 2.34375/- 0.421875/- 2.765625/- 3/-
2 1.5625/- 0.28125/- 1.84375/- 2/-
22. Therefore, according to him, there is a legal impossibility in reducing the
Maximum Retail Price ('MRP'). As a result he stated that some of the companies had
passed on the commensurate benefit by way of increasing the grammage. He pointed
out that NAA vide order dated 24th December, 2018 passed in Ankit Kumar Bajoria
vs. M/s Hindustan Unilever Ltd., Case No.20/2018, had accepted the practice of
increasing grammage. However, this practice had not been accepted as a mode of
passing on commensurate benefit by NAA in subsequent orders.
23. Learned counsel for the petitioners pointed out that there is no provision of
appeal against the orders passed by NAA. They submitted that the absence of a
provision to appeal means that there is no judicial oversight over the decisions of
NAA and indicates that there is a presumption that the findings of NAA are infallible.
They submitted that Tribunals and Authorities which exercise functions similar to
NAA have a robust appellate mechanism. They submitted that lack of a provision to
appeal against the findings of NAA makes the Act, 2017 unconstitutional.
24. They submitted that Rule 124 of Rules, 2017 to the extent it deals with
appointment and terms and conditions of service of the Chairman and Members
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 of NAA is not in consonance
with Article 50 of the Constitution of India as there is scope for governmental
interference in the functioning of NAA.
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
58
25. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that NAA essentially determines
the rights of those complainants who filed complaints and determines liabilities of
the tax assessees against whom such an application/complaint is made / received.
Therefore, according to them, since the exercise of power by NAA is a quasi-judicial
function, the absence of a judicial member in the constitution of NAA renders Section
171 of the Act, 2017 and Rule 122 of the Rules, 2017 illegal and void. In support of
their submissions, they relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in Madras Bar
Association v. Union of India, (2015) 8 SCC 583, Madras Bar Association v. Union of
India, (2010) 11 SCC 1 and L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India, (1997) 3 SCC 261.
26. They further submitted that in case of equality of votes amongst the members of
NAA, the Chairperson has a second or casting vote, which renders Rule 134(2) illegal
and unconstitutional.
27. Learned counsel for the petitioner in W.P.(C) 12647/2018 stated that the report
issued by DGAP and the order passed by NAA in its case were barred by limitation as
provided under Rule 133 of the Rules, 2017. He submitted that Rule 133 uses the
word "shall" and thus mandates that NAA must determine and pass an order within a
period of three months (prior to amendment dated 28th June, 2019) from date of
receipt of the report from DGAP. He further submitted that the procedure that has
been prescribed under the Rule 129(6) ought to have been strictly followed by the
DGAP while investigating other products. He pointed out that in the case of the
petitioner in W.P.(C) 12647/2018, Rule 129(6) of the Rules, 2017 as on 25th
September, 2018 (the date on which NAA passed its order directing the DGAP to
conduct investigation on the amount allegedly profiteered W.P.(C) 7743/2019 &
other connected matters 18:24:48 by the petitioner) or 30th October, 2018 (the date
when the notice was issued by DGAP) mandatorily provided that DGAP was required
to complete its investigation within three months. However, the report was submitted
on 30th September, 2019 which is beyond the prescribed limitation period and thus,
the same was without jurisdiction. He submitted that at the time the proceedings
were initiated by NAA, Rule 129(6) of the Rules, 2017 mandated that the DGAP
"shall" submit its report to NAA within three months which could be further
extended to six months. Such time period was subsequently extended to six months
vide Notification No. 31/2019 dated 28th June, 2019 which could be further extended
to nine months. However, the impugned order is barred by limitation even if period
is taken as six months as applicable from 28th June, 2019.
28. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that under Rule 133(3) of the Rules, 2017, NAA
does not have any power or authority in law to pass an order in relation to any product, other than
the product against which complaint has been received by the authorities. They submitted that till
28th June, 2019 (when Rule 133(5) was enacted), NAA had no powers to direct investigation in
respect of any product, other than the product complained of. However, with effect from 28th June,
2019, Rule 133(5) was introduced, whereby for the first time, NAA was statutorily empowered in the
course of the proceedings before it, to direct the DGAP, to conduct an investigation in relation to
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
59
products, other than the product complained of. They submitted that as a result of the amendment,
the power to expand the scope of the investigation vests only with NAA and not with DGAP. They
pointed out that in many cases, DGAP had on its own expanded the scope of the investigation to
other products, which according to them, is without jurisdiction and ultra vires the provisions of the
Act, 2017 and Rules, 2017.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
29. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the levy of penalty and interest cannot be
ordered in the absence of corresponding specific substantive provisions under the Act, 2017. They
submitted that the consequences of the breach of Section 171 of Act, 2017 should have been provided
for in the first instance in the Act, 2017 itself and such wide and uncontrolled powers could not have
been conferred on NAA under Rules 127 and 133 of Rules, 2017. In support of their submission, they
relied upon the judgments of the Supreme Court in Indian Carbon Limited v. State of Assam (1997)
6 SCC 479 and Shree Bhagwati Steel Rolling Mills v. CCE 2015 (326) E.L.T. 209 (SC).
30. They stated that the petitioners have been issued show cause notices directing them to explain
why penalty prescribed under Section 171(3A) of the Act, 2017 read with Rule 133 (3) (d) of the
Rules, 2017 should not be imposed upon them. They, however, submitted that Section 171 (3A) has
been inserted in the Act, 2017 under Section 112 of the Finance Act, 2019 which came into force only
from 01st January, 2020 and so penalty under the aforesaid Section could not have been imposed
on the petitioners retrospectively.
31. Learned senior counsel for the petitioner in W.P.(C) 1171/2020 submitted that on a plain reading
of Section 171(1) with Section 2(108) of the Act, 2017, it is clear that it applies to a reduction in the
rate of Goods and Services Tax levied on a particular commodity or a grant of Input Tax Credit
under the Act, 2017. He stated that the term 'tax on any supply of goods or services' and Input Tax
Credit in Section 171 do not refer to any tax levied prior to 1st July, 2017 or to any Input Tax Credit
granted under any such prior statute. Therefore, according to him, Section 171(1) of the Act, 2017
does not contemplate a comparison of the taxes levied after the introduction of the Act, 2017 with a
basket of distinct indirect taxes applicable on goods and services before the operation of the Act. He
stated W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 that the indirect taxes levied on
goods and services prior to July, 2017 by the States such as the VAT/Sales-tax, Octroi duty and
Entry tax varied widely from State to State and often from area to area within a State. He stated that
as a result, it is impossible to make any meaningful comparison between the rates of the pre- Goods
and Services Tax taxes with the rates of tax levied under the Goods and Services Tax regime.
32. According to him, Section 171 of the Act, 2017 only permits a comparison between two single
rates and not a comparison between one single tax rate (Goods and Services Tax) and a basket or
combination of several other tax rates (pre-Goods and Services Tax indirect taxes). He submitted
that Sections 2(62) and 2(63) of the Act, 2017 make it clear that the benefit of Input Tax Credits
referred to in Section 171(1) are the Input Tax Credit granted under the Act, 2017 and not the Input
Tax Credits granted under the Central Excise Act, the Service- Tax statute or the Sales-tax Acts. He
further submitted that Section 9 of the Act, 2017 which provides for the levy of 'a tax called the
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
60
central goods and services tax on all intra-State supplies of goods or services or both...' uses the
same language as Section 171 and therefore Section 171 refers only to a reduction in the rate of tax
levied / referred to under Section 9 of the Act, 2017.
33. Learned senior counsel for the petitioners in W.P.(C) 2897/2021, submitted that in a contract
made after the reduction in the tax rate has come into effect, the parties are free to agree on any
price. In support of his submission, he relied on Section 64-A of the Sale of Goods Act, which reads
as under:-
"64A. In contracts of sale, amount of increased or decreased taxes to be added or
deducted.--
(1) Unless a different intention appears from the terms of the contract, in the event of
any tax of the nature described in sub-section (2) being imposed, increased,
decreased or remitted in respect of any goods after the making of W.P.(C) 7743/2019
& other connected matters 18:24:48 any contract for the sale or purchase of such
goods without stipulation as to the payment of tax where tax was not chargeable at
the time of the making of the contract, or for the sale or purchase of such goods
tax-paid where tax was chargeable at that time,--
(a) if such imposition or increase so takes effect that the tax or increased tax, as the
case may be, or any part of such tax is paid or is payable, the seller may add so much
to the contract price as will be equivalent to the amount paid or payable in respect of
such tax or increase of tax, and he shall be entitled to be paid and to sue for and
recover such addition; and
(b) if such decrease or remission so takes effect that the decreased tax only, or no tax,
as the case may be, is paid or is payable, the buyer may deduct so much from the
contract price as will be equivalent to the decrease of tax or remitted tax, and he shall
not be liable to pay, or be sued for, or in respect of, such deduction.
(2) The provisions of sub-section (1) apply to the following taxes, namely:--
(a) any duty of customs or excise on goods;
(b) any tax on the sale or purchase of goods."
34. Learned counsel for the petitioner in W.P.(C) 2785/2021 submitted that as per Section 171(2)
read with Section 2(80) of the Act, 2017, the authority (empowered to examine whether there has
been commensurate reduction in price) has to be constituted by way of a duly gazetted notification
and as per Section 166 of the Act, 2017, such notification has to be laid before the Parliament. He
stated that contrary to these requirements, NAA had been constituted vide an administrative order
No.343/2017 dated 28th November, 2017. He stated that Rule 122 of the Rules, 2017 has been
notified and gazetted vide Notification No. 10/2017-Central Tax dated 28th June, 2017, which, at
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
61
first blush, suggests that NAA had been constituted thereunder. However, on a closer analysis, it is
clear that the said Rule cannot be said to be the fountainhead of constitution of NAA as Rule 122
essentially provides for composition of NAA and not for the constitution of NAA, even though the
heading of the Rule is couched to suggest that the same apparently constitutes NAA. He submitted
that if the said Rule W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 (which was notified on
28th June, 2017) was indeed the fountainhead of constitution of NAA, the same would go against
the very understanding of the respondents as recorded in the 35th and 45th Goods and Services Tax
Council Minutes of Meeting as well as the Memo dated 09th September, 2019 of the Department of
Revenue, Ministry of Finance, wherein it has been specifically observed that NAA had been
constituted vide an office order dated 28th November, 2017.
ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
35. Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondent-authorities,
prefaced his submissions by stating that Parliament introduced the Act, 2017 in order to simplify
and harmonise the indirect taxes regime in the country by eliminating the multiplicity of taxes that
were levied on the same supply system as a result of which there was a cascading effect.
36. According to him, the "anti-profiteering" measures were introduced in the Goods and Services
Tax regime in order to provide for a mechanism to ensure that the full benefits of input tax credits
and reduced Goods and Services Tax rates flow to the consumers who bear the burden of tax and to
prevent the suppliers from appropriating these benefits for themselves. He contended that
anti-profiteering provisions under the Act, 2017 and the Rules, 2017 have been brought into force in
the interest of consumer welfare and so any interpretation of the same must be in favour of the
consumer.
37. He stated that the provisions essentially create a substantive restriction on the suppliers from
appropriating the benefits of the Goods and Services Tax regime which may either be in the form of
reduction in the tax rate effected pursuant to a decision of the Goods and Services Tax Council or in
the form of W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 benefit of Input Tax Credit
which was unavailable under the earlier regime. He stated that correspondingly a substantive right
has been created in favour of consumers to receive the benefit of reduction in rates and benefit of
Input Tax Credit. He stated that in considering the constitutional vires of such a provision, the
larger public welfare intended to accrue from the provision ought to be taken into consideration. He
relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Ltd. vs.
Union of India, (2019) 8 SCC 416, wherein the Supreme Court examined a challenge to the
amendments to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. He stated that in the aforesaid case the
fact that the impugned provisions were part of a beneficial legislation was treated as an important
factor in order to uphold the provisions.
38. He further submitted that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 has been enacted in furtherance of the
goals of redistributive justice contained in the Directive Principles of State policy in Articles 38,
39(b) and 39(c) of the Constitution of India. The relevant portion of Articles 38, 39(b) and 39(c) are
reproduced hereinbelow:-
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024

"Article 38 - State to secure a social order for the promotion of welfare of the people
(1) The State shall strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing and
protecting as effectively as it may a social order in which justice, social, economic and
political, shall inform all the institutions of the national life.
Article 39 - Certain principles of policy to be followed by the State The State shall, in particular,
direct its policy towards securing-- ...
(b) that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as
best to sub serve the common good;
(c) that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and
means of production to the common detriment;"
(emphasis supplied) W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
39. He submitted that the scope of judicial review in a fiscal statute is fairly limited as laid down by
the Supreme Court in multiple judgments such as State of M.P. v. Rakesh Kohli, (2012) 6 SCC 312
and R. K. Garg v. Union of India, 1981 (4) SCC 675.
40. He further submitted that Article 246A of the Constitution of India empowers the Legislature to
make laws 'with respect to' Goods and Services Tax. Article 246A of the Constitution reads as
under:-
"246A. Special provision with respect to goods and services tax.--
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in articles 246 and 254, Parliament, and,
subject to clause (2), the Legislature of every State, have power to make laws with
respect to goods and services tax imposed by the Union or by such State.
(2) Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to goods and services
tax where the supply of goods, or of services, or both takes place in the course of
inter-State trade or commerce.
Explanation.--The provisions of this article, shall, in respect of goods and services tax referred to in
clause (5) of article 279A, take effect from the date recommended by the Goods and Services Tax
Council."
41. He submitted that the impugned Section 171 of the Act, 2017 does not violate Article 246A of the
Constitution of India as the said Section is not a taxing provision but is only meant to ensure that
the sacrifice of tax revenue by the Central and State Governments for the welfare of the consumer is
passed on to them by the supplier.
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
63
42. He stated that the reduction of the tax burden and elimination of the cascading effect of taxes
were important objectives behind the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax and so the
impugned Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is very much a provision 'with respect to' Goods and Services
Tax and, therefore, Section 171 of the Act, 2017 falls well within the ambit of law-making powers of
the Parliament and the State legislatures. He further submitted that it is a well W.P.(C) 7743/2019 &
other connected matters 18:24:48 settled principle that in the field of taxation, the legislature enjoys
a greater latitude for classification as has been noted by the Supreme Court in various cases [See:
Steelworth Ltd. vs. State of Assam [1962] Supp (2) SCR 589]; Gopal Narain vs. State of U.P. [AIR
1964 SC 370]; Ganga Sugar Corp. Ltd. vs. State of U.P. [(1980) 1 SCC 223].
43. Countering the submissions of the Petitioners that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 suffers from the
vice of excessive delegation, Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel, submitted that no essential
legislative function has been delegated by the Legislature to NAA by way of Section 171 of the Act,
2017. He stated that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is very clear when it states that any reduction in the
rate of tax or the benefit of input tax credit has to be passed on to the recipient by way of
commensurate reduction in prices, that is to say that every person who is a recipient of goods or
services has to get the benefit. He further stated that it cannot be said that Section 171 of the Act,
2017 does not provide method and procedure for determining profiteering as it clearly stipulates
that 'any reduction' in the rate of tax on 'any supply of goods or services' or the benefit of input tax
credit shall be passed on to the recipient by way of 'commensurate reduction in prices'.
44. He emphatically denied that the word 'commensurate' as used in Section 171 of the Act, 2017 has
no clear and definite meaning. He referred to the Cambridge Dictionary where the word
'commensurate' is defined as 'in a correct and suitable amount compared to something else; suitable
in amount or quality compared to something else; matching in degree'. Thus, according to him,
Section 171 lays down a clear legislative policy and hence, no essential legislative function has been
delegated. He submitted that the Courts have consistently held that after laying down the broad
legislative policy, the minutiae can always be left W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters
18:24:48 to be decided by way of a subordinate legislation (See: Lohia Machines Ltd. vs. Union of
India, (1985) 2 SCC 197, Pt. Banarsi Das Bhanot vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, AIR 1958 SC 909, Sita
Ram Bishambher Dayal vs. State of U.P. (1972) 4 SCC 485). He further stated that it is well settled
that the question whether any particular legislation suffers from excessive delegation, has to be
determined by the Court having regard to the subject matter, the scheme, the provisions of the
statute including its preamble and the background on which the statute is enacted. In support of his
contentions, he relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Bhatnagars & Co. Ltd. vs. Union of
India, AIR 1957 SC 478 and Mohmedalli and Ors. vs. Union of India and Ors., AIR 1964 SC 980.
45. He further submitted that power of NAA to determine procedure and methodology flows from
Section 171 of the Act, 2017 itself which empowers the Authority to examine whether Input Tax
Credits availed by any registered person or the reduction in the tax rate on the goods or services had
actually resulted in commensurate reduction in the price of such goods or services. He stated that
the rule-making powers of the Central Government as prescribed in sub section (2) of Section 171 of
the Act, 2017 as well as Section 164 of the Act, 2017 empower the Central Government to prescribe
the powers and functions of the authority as well as to prescribe a Rule conferring the Authority with
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
64
the power to determine the methodology for determining whether the benefits of Goods and
Services Tax rate reductions and Input Tax Credits have been passed on. According to him, it is in
this background that the power to prescribe the powers and functions of NAA was delegated to the
Central Government by the Section. He, therefore, submitted that the principle delegatus non potest
delegare is not applicable to the present batch of matters.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
46. He stated that Section 171(3) of the Act, 2017 duly provides that the Authority shall exercise such
powers and discharge such functions as may be prescribed. Accordingly, he stated that the Goods
and Services Tax Council which is a federal, constitutional body, comprising all the Finance
Ministers of all the States and UTs and the Union Finance Minister, in its due wisdom, and the
Central and the State Governments have framed Rules 127 and 133 which prescribe the functions
and powers of the Authority. He pointed out that these rules have been framed under the provisions
of Section 164 of the Act, 2017 which also has sanction of the Parliament and the State Legislatures.
Therefore, since the functions and powers to be exercised by the Authority have been approved by
competent legislatures, the same are legal and binding on the Petitioners. In support of his
submissions, he relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in M.K. Papiah vs. Excise Commr.
(1975) 1 SCC 492.
47. Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel stated that even if the petitioners' contention that no
methodology for calculating the profiteered amount had been prescribed is accepted, then also the
said Section will not be rendered unconstitutional because as per Rule 126 of the Rules, 2017, NAA
has been empowered to determine the said methodology. He pointed out that the Rule does not
stipulate that NAA must necessarily determine the methodology and procedure to compute
profiteering as it merely stipulates that the authority 'may' determine the methodology and
procedure for such computation. He stated that substantive provision of Section 171 of the Act, 2017
provides sufficient guidance to the NAA to determine the methodology on a case to case basis
depending on the peculiar facts of each case and the nature of the industry and its peculiarities.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
48. Additionally he stated that no uniform calculation method can be prescribed because the
computation of commensurate reduction in prices is purely a mathematical exercise and would vary
from SKU to SKU or unit to unit or service to service and hence for determining the quantum of
benefit as the extent of profiteering has to be arrived at on a case to case basis, by adopting suitable
method based on the nature and facts of each case. He further stated that NAA in exercise of the
powers conferred under Rule 126 of the Central Goods and Services Tax has notified the "National
Anti-Profiteering Authority:
Methodology and Procedure, 2018" dated 28th March, 2018 which contains the
methodology and procedure for determination as to whether the reduction in the rate
of tax on supply of goods or services or the benefit of Input Tax Credit has been
passed on by the registered person to the recipient by way of commensurate
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
65
reduction in prices.
49. In the context of the real estate sector, he stated that in cases where completion certificate had
not been issued prior to 01st July, 2017 and the supply of service by the developer continued past
01st July, 2017, the supplier got the benefit of Input Tax Credits under the Goods and Services Tax
regime. That being the case, there is no reason why a supplier ought not to be required to pass on
the benefit of Input Tax Credits under the Goods and Services Tax regime, with respect to the
remaining supply. According to him, a plain reading of Section 171 of the Act, 2017 would require
such developers to pass on the benefit of Input Tax Credits.
50. He stated that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 when it uses the term 'any supply' refers to each
taxable supply made to each recipient thereby clearly indicating that netting off of the benefit of tax
reduction by any supplier is not allowed. Hence, according to him, this benefit has to be calculated
for the SKU of W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 every product and has to be
passed on to every buyer of such SKU. These benefits, he stated cannot be passed on at the
entity/organization/branch/invoice/ product/business vertical level as they have to be passed on to
each and every buyer at each SKU/unit/service level by treating them equally. Additionally, he
stated that the language of the impugned provisions does not provide flexibility to adopt any other
mode for transferring benefit of reduction in tax rate and benefit of Input Tax Credit. He, thus,
stated that the Methodology & Procedure for passing on the benefits and for computation of the
profiteered amount has been duly prescribed in Section 171 of the Act, 2017 itself and hence, it is not
required to be prescribed separately.
51. He stated that in the case of reduction in the rate of tax, the quantum of benefit would depend
upon the pre reduction base price of the product which is required to be maintained during the post
rate reduction period on which the reduced rate of tax is required to be charged which would result
in reduction in the price. According to him, the new MRP is required to be declared by affixing
additional sticker or stamping or online printing in terms of letter No. WM/10(31)/2017 dated 16th
November, 2017 issued by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution,
Government of India.
52. While dealing with the argument of the Petitioners that it is legally impossible to pass on the
benefits of the reduction of rate of tax in cases of low priced products in the FMCG industry,
Mr.Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel, submitted that the Rules 2(m) and 6(1)(e) of Legal Metrology
(Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 (as amended from time to time) provide guidance to the
suppliers on how the MRP of the products is to be rounded off. The relevant portion of the aforesaid
Rules are reproduced as hereinunder:-
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 "Legal Metrology (Packaged

Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 as amended by the Legal Metrology
(Packaged Commodities) Amendment Rules, 2017 with effect from 1st January, 2018:
2. Definitions:-
'(m) "retail sale price" means the maximum price at which the commodity in

words and figures shall be inserted, namely:- "shall clearly indicate that it is the
maximum retail price inclusive of all taxes and the price in rupees and paise be

53. He agreed with the contention of the petitioners that in some cases, commercial factors might
necessitate an increase in price despite reduction in rate W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 of tax or availability of benefit of Input Tax Credits. However, he stated that the
prices must not be increased to appropriate the benefit of the reduced tax rate or benefit of
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
67
additional Input Tax Credit that accrues to the Petitioners. According to him, if the supplier never
passed on the benefit of such reduced tax rate or Input Tax Credit by way of a commensurate
reduction in prices of the goods or services, by increasing the base price of such goods or services, he
would be depriving the recipients of the benefits of the reduction of tax rates or Input Tax Credits.
Hence, he stated that if the supplier when increasing the base prices of the goods or services does
not account for the (commensurate) reduction of prices as a result of the reduction of the tax rates
or benefit of the Input Tax Credits, the supplier would be said to be profiteering under Section 171 of
the Act, 2017. He, however, stated that NAA as well as this Court ought to be cautious of attempts of
entities to justify suspicious increase in base prices contemporaneous with the reduction in tax rates
or accruing of benefits of Input Tax Credits, under the garb of other commercial factors. According
to him, the Courts and implementing authorities must be vigilant about devices designed for
avoidance and must seek to adopt interpretations of the provisions that are least prone to resulting
in avoidance. He referred to the judgment in McDowell & Co. Ltd. v. CTO, (1985) 3 SCC 230 where it
has been held that "the proper way to construe a taxing statute, while considering a device to avoid
tax, is not to ask whether the provisions should be construed literally or liberally, nor whether the
transaction is not unreal and not prohibited by the statute, but whether the transaction is a device to
avoid tax, and whether the transaction is such that the judicial process may accord its approval to it"
and that "it is up to the Court to take stock to determine the nature of the new and sophisticated
legal devices to avoid tax and consider whether the situation created by the devices could be related
to the W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 existing legislation with the aid of
"emerging" techniques of interpretation." He submitted that although the aforesaid findings were
made in the context of tax avoidance, they would apply with equal force in the context of any
beneficial legislation.
54. Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel further stated that reference made by the petitioners to
guidelines under other laws and to certain foreign laws, is irrelevant to the issue of the
constitutional validity of Section 171 of the Act, 2017 as validity has to be determined on its own
merits.
55. He further stated that according to petitioners' own submissions the anti- profiteering provisions
introduced in Australia and Malaysia were essentially price control mechanisms as the legislation
enacted in Australia was aimed at prohibiting 'price exploitation' and the Act enacted in Malaysia
was aimed at prohibiting manufacturers from 'making unreasonably high profits'.
56. He stated that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is not a price-fixing provision as was sought to be
asserted by the Petitioners. He submitted that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 only concerns itself with
the indirect-tax component of the price of goods and services and does not impinge upon the
freedom of suppliers to fix prices of their goods and services keeping in view relevant commercial
and economic factors. He stated that the impugned section in pith and substance is a provision
pertaining to the Goods and Services Tax and through its enactment the Parliament sought to
ensure that the businesses pass on the benefits granted by the Government in term of reduction of
tax rate and availability of Input Tax Credit to the consumers and does not seek to interfere with the
right to trade by fixing the price at which the goods and services ought to be supplied. He pointed
out that the impugned provision applies irrespective of the price of the goods or services. He stated
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
68
that it cannot be said that a law which forbids recovery of W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 Goods and Services Tax at a rate higher than that applicable on the goods and
services and which forbids suppliers from recovering Input Taxes from the recipients where credits
are obtained on such Input Taxes, amounts to price- control or price-fixing.
57. He further submitted that even if Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is presumed to be a price-fixing
legislation, it would not render the Section violative of Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India.
He submitted that the Supreme Court in several cases such as Diwan General and Sugar Mills Pvt.
Ltd. & Ors. vs. Union of India, AIR (1959) SC 626; Union of India vs. Cynamide India Ltd., (1987) 2
SCC 720 where price fixing orders had been challenged, had upheld such orders by examining
whether the orders take into account relevant factors/considerations.
58. He submitted that there is no legal principle on the basis of which the petitioners can contend
that the mere absence of a time period, up to which reduced prices are required to be maintained,
would render the provision unconstitutional.
59. He submitted that recently, a three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Madras Bar
Association v. Union of India & Anr., (2021) SCC OnLine SC 463, while considering the challenge to
the vires of Tribunal Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2021 and
Sections 184 and 186(2) of the Finance Act, 2017 as amended by the Tribunal Reforms
(Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2021, held that "the apprehensions of misuse
of a statutory provision is not a ground to declare the provisions of a statute as void."
60. Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel, submitted that for an appeal to be maintainable, it must
have its genesis in the authority of law [See: M. Ramnarain W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 (P) Ltd. v. State Trading Corpn. of India Ltd. [(1983) 3 SCC 75 and Gujarat Agro
Industries Co. Ltd. v. Municipal Corpn. of the City of Ahmedabad (1999) 4 SCC 468]. He submitted
that the principle of "appeal being a statutory right and no party having a right to file appeal except
in accordance with the prescribed procedure" is now well settled as held by the Supreme Court in
CCI v. SAIL, (2010) 10 SCC 744. According to him, the right to appeal is not a right which can be
assumed by logical analysis much less by exercise of inherent jurisdiction. It essentially should be
provided by the law in force. In the absence of any specific provision creating a right in a party to file
an appeal, such right can neither be assumed nor inferred in favour of the party.
61. He stated that Section 171(2) of the Act, 2017 lays down the role of NAA which is to examine
whether Input Tax Credit availed by any registered person and/or the reduction in tax rates have
actually resulted in a commensurate reduction in the price of goods or services supplied by him and
the duties of NAA have been further elaborated upon in Rule 127 of the Rules, 2017. He further
stated that from a perusal of the aforesaid provision, it is clear that the functions of NAA are in the
nature of a fact-finding exercise. He submitted that even if it is assumed that the Authority
undertakes an exercise which determines the rights and liabilities of registered persons under the
Act, the contention of the Petitioners that the absence of a judicial member in NAA renders the
authority unconstitutional is not tenable as there is no universal principle that every quasi- judicial
authority at every level must have a judicial member. According to him, such a requirement would
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
69
not only be wholly impractical but also be legally suspect. He stated that the judgments which have
been relied upon by the petitioners follow a uniform principle that whenever a judicial tribunal is
intended to replace or supplant the High Court with respect to judicial power which was W.P.(C)
7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 hitherto vested in or exercised by Courts, such
Tribunals must be manned by judicial members in addition to technical members who have
specialized knowledge or expertise in a given field. In support of his submissions, he relied on the
judgments of the Supreme Court in Union of India vs. R. Gandhi, (2010) 11 SCC 1, Rojer Mathews
vs. South Indian Bank, (2019) SCC OnLine SC 1456. He stated: (a) the NAA did not replace or
substitute any function which Courts were exercising hitherto; (b) it performs quasi-judicial
functions but cannot be equated with a judicial tribunal; (c) it performs its functions in a fair and
reasonable manner in accordance with the Act but does not have the trappings of a Court and (d)
absence of a judicial member does not render the constitution of the NAA unconstitutional or legally
invalid.
62. He further stated that there are several statutory bodies that exercise quasi- judicial functions,
but are not required to have judicial members. For example, Section 4(1) of the Securities and
Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 which provides for the composition of the Securities and
Exchange Board of India ('SEBI'), does not necessarily require the presence of Judicial Members in
SEBI. He pointed out that the fact that the SEBI inter-alia performs judicial functions has been
recognized by the Supreme Court in Clariant International Ltd. & Anr. vs. Securities and Exchange
Board of India (2004) 8 SCC 524. Similarly, he stated that Telecom Regulatory Authority of India,
Medical Council of India, Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the Assessing Officers,
CIT (Appeals), Dispute Resolution Panel under the Income Tax Act perform quasi- judicial
functions but there is no requirement that such members must possess either a law degree or have
had judicial experience.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
63. He submitted that a casting vote in the hands of the chairperson is a fair and reasonable manner
of deciding a tie in votes and is commonly provided for in several laws.
64. He stated that NAA has been constituted as per the provisions of Rule 122 of the Rules, 2017.
The Rules, 2017, including Rule 122, have been duly notified by the Ministry of Finance, Department
of Revenue, Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs vide Notification No. 3/2017- Central Tax
dated 19th June, 2017 and published in the Gazette of India- Extraordinary vide G.S.R. No. 610(E)
on the same date and hence NAA has been duly constituted by a Notification as required under
Section 171(2) of the Act, 2017. The above notification dated 19th June, 2017 was laid before the Lok
Sabha on 11th August, 2017 and before the Rajya Sabha on 08th August, 2017 as required by Section
166 of the Act, 2017.
65. He submitted that in the absence of an express provision to the effect that anti-profiteering
proceedings would abate if time-lines are not strictly adhered to, and if the time-lines are read to be
mandatory, it would result in gross injustice to the consumers who would be left remediless on
account of no fault of theirs.
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
70
66. Further, in the absence of anything to the contrary in the amendment or the amended provision,
on a plain reading of the provision, the amended/extended time-period for passing of an order
would apply to all pending and future proceedings before NAA. He submitted that the time-frames
provided in the anti- profiteering provisions are merely directory in nature and not mandatory.
67. Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel, stated that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is widely worded
and does not limit the scope of examination to only the goods and services in respect of which a
complaint is received by the authorities. He submitted that Rule 129 of the Rules, 2017, which
provides for the scope of W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 powers of the
DGAP, uses the words 'any supply of goods or services' and so the scope of powers of DGAP is very
wide.
68. He stated that the contention of the petitioners that there was no mechanism for recovery of the
alleged profiteered amount under Section 171 of the Act, 2017 overlooks Rule 133(3)(b) of the Rules,
2017 prescribed under Section 171(3) of the Act, 2017 which empowers NAA to order a supplier to
return to the recipient, an amount equivalent to the amount not passed on by way of commensurate
reduction in prices along with interest at the rate of eighteen per cent [18%] from the date of
collection of the higher amount till the date of the return of such amount or recovery of the amount
not returned including interest, as the case may be.
69. Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel, submitted that the judgments of Supreme Court in Indian
Carbon Ltd. Vs. State of Assam, (1997) 6 SCC 479 and Shree Bhagwati Steel Rolling Mills vs. CCE
(2016) 3 SCC 643 etc. relied upon by the petitioners were delivered in the context of considering the
question of whether interest can be levied for delayed payment of tax and whether penalty can be
imposed for non-payment of tax under a Rule where the Statute does not authorize the same.
70. He submitted that by virtue of Rule 133(3)(d) of the Rules, 2017, NAA was already vested with
the powers to impose penalties even before Section 171(3A) came into force. According to him,
Section 171(3A) of the Act, 2017 is therefore merely clarificatory in nature. He further submitted that
in the absence of a power to impose penalties, there would be no consequence arising out of the
violation of Section 171(1) of the Act, 2017 by suppliers and consequently, there would be no
deterrence against non-compliance.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
71. Even otherwise, he stated that show cause notices initiating penalty proceedings in relation to
violation of Section 171(1) prior to the coming into force of Section 171(3A) of the Act, 2017, have
been withdrawn by NAA and penalty proceedings in all such cases are not being pressed and so this
issue has become infructuous. Insofar as the objection regarding levy of interest is concerned, he
submitted that the object of the anti-profiteering measures provided in Section 171 of the Act, 2017
is to ensure that the Input Tax Credits availed by any registered person or the reduction in tax rate
result in a commensurate reduction in the price of goods or services or both supplied by him and as
a result, the benefit of the same passed on to the recipients. He stated that the profiteered amount
includes the benefit of reduction in taxes or Input Tax Credits which was required to be passed on by
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
71
way of reduction in prices as well as the tax thereon which the consumer is forced to pay as a result
of the non-reduction of prices as required under Section 171(1) of the Act, 2017. He emphasised that
had the supplier passed on the benefit of reduction in tax rates or Input Tax Credit by way of
reduction in prices, the consumer would not have been required to pay the additional Goods and
Services Tax.
72. Mr. Zoheb Hossain submitted that without prejudice to the fact that each and every Act of NAA
is well reasoned and justified and can be defended to the satisfaction of this Court as and when the
same are taken up case-wise, the case- specific submissions of the petitioners have no bearing
whatsoever while considering the constitutional vires of Section 171 of the Act, 2017 and Rules
contained in Chapter XV of the Rules, 2017.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE
LEARNED AMICUS CURIAE
73. Mr. Amar Dave, learned Amicus Curiae stated that the cardinal objective with which the Goods
and Services Tax had been introduced was inter alia to ensure an efficient and robust indirect taxing
system.
74. He contended that a perusal of the reports and the discussions preceding the introduction of
Goods and Services Tax regime clearly indicated that the impact on prices of various goods and
services had been factored in as a necessary consequence of the shift over to the Goods and Services
Tax regime.
75. He pointed out that the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India ('CAG') of June,
2010 dealt with the manner in which the Value Added Tax ('VAT') was implemented in India and
accordingly threw light on the lessons for transition to Goods and Services Tax. One of the elements
covered in the said report was the impact that VAT had on prices of goods. The report found that the
white paper at the time of introduction of VAT was sanguine that implementation of VAT would
bring down the prices of goods due to rationalisation of tax rates and abolition of cascading effect of
tax in the legacy systems. However, on the examination and analysis of a small data survey, the CAG
found that the manufacturers did not reduce the maximum retail prices after introduction of VAT
even when there had been a substantial reduction in tax rates. It was, therefore, found that despite
introduction of VAT and reduction in the tax rates, the benefits ensuing from such reduction were
not passed on to the consumers by the manufacturers and the dealer networks across the VAT chain
had enriched themselves at the cost of the common man. The report highlighted these aspects as
those to be borne in mind at the time of considering the shift over to the Goods and Services Tax
regime and to ensure mechanism for the purposes W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters
18:24:48 of passing on the benefit of tax rationalisation to the ultimate common man.
76. He stated that similarly, another report of the taskforce on Goods and Services Tax i.e. the 13th
Finance Commission Report of 15th December, 2009 comprehensively dealt with minute aspects of
the contemplated Goods and Services Tax ecosystem and various elements of such switchover. In its
introduction, the report contemplated inter alia that the prevailing indirect tax system both at the
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
72
Central and the State level included high import tariffs, excise duties and turnover tax on domestic
goods and services having cascading effects, leading to a distorted structure of production,
consumption and exports and this problem could be effectively addressed by shifting the tax burden
from production and trade to final consumption. The report highlighted the implications of the
switchover to Goods and Services Tax and the benefits that would entail from such a switchover. He
pointed out that para 7.22 of the said report specifically recorded that the benefit to the poor from
the implementation of Goods and Services Tax would flow from two sources, first through increase
in the income levels and second through reduction in prices of goods consumed by them. It was
specifically observed that the proposed switchover to the flawless Goods and Services Tax system
should therefore be viewed as a pro-poor system and not regressive. The report further specifically
went into the implications of the proposed switchover to Goods and Services Tax on various
products and sectors including prices of the goods.
77. He further stated that the Report of the Select Committee (presented to the Rajya Sabha on 22nd
July, 2015) dealt with the issues of transition to Goods and Services Tax and the same dealt with
inter alia issues of consumer benefit that would arise on account of the transition and related
aspects.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
78. Learned Amicus Curiae contended that the discussions at the time of the introduction of the
Goods and Services Tax Bill in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha with regard to Section 171 of the
Act, 2017 left no room for doubt that the said measure was introduced as a consumer benefit
measure in order to ensure that the past experiences of the stakeholders retaining the benefit of tax
reductions due to lack of legal mechanism is not repeated at the time of the switchover to Goods and
Services Tax regime.
79. He submitted that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is a stand-alone provision and provides for all the
parameters which act as navigational tools while applying the said provision. He submitted that the
pre-requisites for triggering the provision are specifically provided therein and the consequence of
the section is also specifically provided for. He submitted that the beneficiary of the contemplated
benefit provided under the provision is clearly specified, and therefore, all critical aspects of its
applicability and workability stand embedded in the section itself.
80. Learned Amicus Curiae stated that by its very nature, Section 171 of the Act, 2017 provides for an
inherent assumption that the reduction of tax rate or the benefit of Input Tax Credit under the
Goods and Services Tax mechanism specifically requires, as a consequence thereof, a commensurate
reduction in price. He stated that the contention that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 amounts to price
regulation is not correct as the provision has been inserted to ensure specifically that the
consequential effect of the tax rate must enure to the benefit of the consumer. The very foundation
of the same is based on the concept that when the tax rate undergoes a reduction under the Goods
and Services Tax regime, it obviously must translate into price reduction. He submitted that if there
is a variation (which can be justified by the supplier) of other factors such as any W.P.(C) 7743/2019
& other connected matters 18:24:48 costs necessitating the setting off of such reduction of price, the
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
73
inherent presumption is a rebuttable presumption.
81. He submitted that the concept of Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is based on consumer welfare and
equity. He contended that it is also the spirit of the constitutional provisions that no entity can be
permitted to collect any tax (in any direct or indirect manner or by any implicit representation to
that effect) except by the authority of law. Hence, when in spite of the reduction in the applicable tax
rate, consequential reduction of the actual price does not take place and the amount is retained by
the supplier, it would qualify as an unjust enrichment at the cost of the recipient who is the
otherwise beneficiary of the reduction of the tax rate.
82. He stated that any indirect manner of passing on the benefit like 'Diwali Dhamaka' or
cross-subsidisation would be interfering with the right of the recipient to get the direct benefit.
According to him, such an indirect method to pass the benefit is not contemplated under the express
provisions and is also not in sync with the right of the recipient to get the actual benefit of the
change in the tax rate. He stated that no such indirect method to pass on the benefit can be
read-into the provision when the same is consciously not provided for therein thereby
establishing/cementing the right of the recipient/consumer to get the benefit by way of
commensurate reduction of the price itself.
83. Learned Amicus Curiae submitted that under the scheme of the Act, 2017, it is contemplated
that the Central Government on the recommendations of the Goods and Services Tax Council (a
constitutional body formed under the provisions of Article 279A of the Constitution of India) may
constitute an Authority or empower an existing Authority constituted under any law for the purpose
of examining whether benefit has actually been passed on to the W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other
connected matters 18:24:48 recipients as contemplated under Section 171 of the Act, 2017. He
pointed out that Chapter XV of the Rules deals with the subject of anti-profiteering and inter- alia
provides the different layers of fact-finding examination that have to be undertaken with respect to
the actual passing of benefit contemplated under Section 171 of the Act, 2017. According to him, it is
clear from the said Rules that the same contemplates constitution of Standing Committee and
Screening Committee at different levels. Further, under the scheme of the Rules, it is provided that
the Standing Committee shall within a stipulated time frame after following the process prescribed
therein determine whether there is any prima facie evidence to support the claim of the applicant
that the benefit of reduction in the rate of tax or the benefit of Input Tax Credit or the benefit of
Input Tax Credit has, in fact, not been passed on to the recipient. He stated that the scheme of the
Rules therefore contemplates that such application(s) from the interested parties shall be first
examined by the State level Screening Committee if they pertain to issues local in nature and
subsequently be forwarded to the Standing Committee for action. Further, when the Standing
Committee reaches a prima facie conclusion, it shall refer the matter to the DGAP for a detailed
investigation. Rule 129 of the Rules, 2017 provides for a comprehensive mechanism which the
DGAP is required to follow once the matter is forwarded to it. Once the report of the DGAP is
forwarded to the Authority, the Rules provide for the mechanism in which the Authority is to
undertake the exercise of further considerations and reaching its final conclusions. Thus, according
to him, the perusal of the said Scheme under the Rules, 2017 therefore clearly establishes a
fact-finding mechanism at different levels culminating in the final determination of the matter by
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
74
the Authority.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
84. He submitted that in view of the purely fact-based nature of the exercise and the different levels
contemplated for such findings under the Rules the contention that there is lack of appropriate
redressal measures under the Scheme of Anti-Profiteering measures in the Goods and Services Tax
framework is clearly negated.
85. Learned Amicus Curiae submitted that there is no question of any unbridled powers being
conferred on the authority which is entrusted with the obligation of ensuring the compliance of the
said provision as enough guidance emanates from the parent provision itself. He contended that all
the factors such as the nature of the exercise to be carried out; the objective sought to be achieved by
the said exercise; the incorporation of all critical elements which are to guide any such exercise in
the section itself; the nature of the authority contemplated and tasked to carry out the functions; the
period monitoring of the same by the Goods and Services Tax Council etc. are to be considered when
dealing with the subject matter.
COURT'S REASONING PRINCIPLES FOR ADJUDICATING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF AN
ENACTMENT
86. This Court is of the view that the principles for adjudicating the constitutionality of an
enactment are well settled. Though they have been succinctly set out in a number of judgments, yet
this Court considers it appropriate to reiterate them.
87. A Statute can be declared as unconstitutional only if the Petitioners make out a case that the
Legislature did not have the legislative competence to pass such a Statute or that the provisions of
the Statute violate the Fundamental Rights W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
guaranteed under Part-III of the Constitution of India or that the Legislature concerned has
abdicated its essential legislative function or that the impugned provision is arbitrary, unreasonable
or vague in any manner. D.D. Basu in Shorter Constitution of India (16th Edn., 2021) has
enumerated the grounds on which a law may be declared to be unconstitutional as follows:-
(i) Contravention of any fundamental right, specified in Part III of the Constitution.
(ii) Legislating on a subject which is not assigned to the relevant legislature by the
distribution of powers made by the Seventh Schedule, read with the connected
articles.
(iii) Contravention of any of the mandatory provisions of the Constitution which
impose limitations upon the powers of a legislature e.g. Article 301.
(iv) In the case of a State law, it will be invalid insofar as it seeks to operate beyond
the boundaries of the State.
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
75
(v) That the legislature concerned has abdicated its essential legislative function as
assigned to it by the Constitution or has made an excessive delegation of that power
to some other body.
88. It must also be kept in mind that there is always a presumption in favour of constitutionality of
an enactment and the burden to show that there has been a clear transgression of constitutional
principles is upon the person who attacks such an enactment. Whenever constitutionality of a
provision is challenged on the ground that it infringes a fundamental right, the direct and inevitable
effect/consequence of the legislation has to be taken into account. The Supreme Court in Namit
Sharma vs. Union of India, (2013) 1 SCC 745 has held as under:-
"20. Dealing with the matter of closure of slaughterhouses in Hinsa Virodhak Sangh
v. Mirzapur Moti Kuresh Jamat [(2008) 5 SCC 33] , the Court while noticing its
earlier judgment Govt. of A.P. v. P. Laxmi Devi [(2008) 4 SCC 720] , introduced a
rule for exercise of such jurisdiction by the courts stating that the court should
exercise judicial restraint while judging the constitutional validity of the statute or
even that of a delegated legislation and it is only when there is clear violation of a
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 constitutional provision
beyond reasonable doubt that the court should declare a provision to be
unconstitutional....."
(emphasis supplied) COURTS' APPROACH WHILE DEALING WITH TAX OR ECONOMIC LAWS
89. Further, the Courts have consistently held that the laws relating to economic activities have to be
viewed with greater latitude than laws touching civil rights and that the Legislature has to be
allowed some play in the joints because it has to deal with complex problems. The Supreme Court in
its recent judgment in Union of India vs. VKC Footsteps India (P) Ltd., 2021 SCC OnLine SC 706 has
reiterated the approach that the Courts have to adopt while dealing with tax or economic
regulations. The relevant portion of the said judgment is reproduced hereinbelow:-
"135. While we are alive to the anomalies of the formula, an anomaly per se cannot
result in the invalidation of a fiscal rule which has been framed in exercise of the
power of delegated legislation. In R.K. Garg [R.K. Garg v. Union of India, (1981) 4
SCC 675 : 1982 SCC (Tax) 30] , P.N. Bhagwati, J. (as the learned Chief Justice then
was) speaking for the Constitution Bench underscored the importance of the
rationale for viewing laws relating to economic activities with greater latitude than
laws touching civil rights. The Court held : (SCC pp. 690- 91, para 8) "8. Another rule
of equal importance is that laws relating to economic activities should be viewed with
greater latitude than laws touching civil rights such as freedom of speech, religion,
etc. It has been said by no less a person than Holmes, J., that the legislature should
be allowed some play in the joints, because it has to deal with complex problems
which do not admit of solution through any doctrinaire or straitjacket formula and
this is particularly true in case of legislation dealing with economic matters, where,
having regard to the nature of the problems required to be dealt with, greater play in
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
76
the joints has to be allowed to the legislature. The court should feel more inclined to
give judicial deference to legislative judgment in the field of economic regulation than
in other areas where fundamental human rights are involved. Nowhere has this
admonition been more felicitously expressed than in Morey v. Doud [Morey v. Doud,
1957 SCC OnLine US SC 105 : 1 L Ed 2d 1485 : 354 US 457 (1957)] where Frankfurter,
J., said in his inimitable style:
In the utilities, tax and economic regulation cases, there are good reasons for judicial
self-restraint if not judicial deference to legislative judgment. The legislature after all
has the affirmative responsibility. The courts have only the power to destroy, not to
reconstruct. When these are added to the complexity of economic regulation, W.P.(C)
7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 the uncertainty, the liability to error,
the bewildering conflict of the experts, and the number of times the Judges have been
overruled by events -- self-limitation can be seen to be the path to judicial wisdom
and institutional prestige and stability. The Court must always remember that
'legislation is directed to practical problems, that the economic mechanism is highly
sensitive and complex, that many problems are singular and contingent, that laws are
not abstract propositions and do not relate to abstract units and are not to be
measured by abstract symmetry'; 'that exact wisdom and nice adaption of remedy are
not always possible' and that 'judgment is largely a prophecy based on meagre and
uninterpreted experience'. Every legislation particularly in economic matters is
essentially empiric and it is based on experimentation or what one may call trial and
error method and therefore it cannot provide for all possible situations or anticipate
all possible abuses. There may be crudities and inequities in complicated
experimental economic legislation but on that account alone it cannot be struck down
as invalid. The courts cannot, as pointed out by the United States Supreme Court in
Secy. of Agriculture v. Central Roig Refining Co. [Secy. of Agriculture v. Central Roig
Refining Co., 1950 SCC OnLine US SC 14 : 94 L Ed 381 : 338 US 604 (1950)] be
converted into tribunals for relief from such crudities and inequities. There may even
be possibilities of abuse, but that too cannot of itself be a ground for invalidating the
legislation, because it is not possible for any legislature to anticipate as if by some
divine prescience, distortions and abuses of its legislation which may be made by
those subject to its provisions and to provide against such distortions and abuses.
Indeed, howsoever great may be the care bestowed on its framing, it is difficult to
conceive of a legislation which is not capable of being abused by perverted human
ingenuity. The Court must therefore adjudge the constitutionality of such legislation
by the generality of its provisions and not by its crudities or inequities or by the
possibilities of abuse of any of its provisions. If any crudities, inequities or
possibilities of abuse come to light, the legislature can always step in and enact
suitable amendatory legislation. That is the essence of pragmatic approach which
must guide and inspire the legislature in dealing with complex economic issues.""
(emphasis supplied) ACT, 2017 MARKS A PARADIGM SHIFT IN THE FIELD OF INDIRECT
TAXES
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
77
90. This Court is of the view that the Act, 2017 not only simplifies and harmonises the indirect tax
regime in the country, but it also marks a paradigm shift in the manner in which they are enacted,
levied and collected in India.
91. The Act, 2017 primarily intends to provide a common national market for Goods and Services as
reflected in its moto 'One Nation One Tax'. It is a consumer-centric Act, as it eliminates the levy of
multiple taxes, avoids any cascading tax effect, streamlines the credit mechanism by weeding out
distortions W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 in the supply chains and
ensures a smooth pass-through and transparent mechanism for levying tax. This is apparent from
the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act, 2017. The same is reproduced hereinbelow:-
"Presently, the Central Government levies tax on, manufacture of certain goods in the
form of Central Excise duty, provision of certain services in the form of service tax,
inter-State sale of goods in the form of Central Sales tax. Similarly, the State
Governments levy tax on and on retail sales in the form of value added tax, entry of
goods in the State in the form of entry tax, luxury tax and purchase tax, etc.
Accordingly, there is multiplicity of taxes which are being levied on the same supply
chain.
2. The present tax system on goods and services is facing certain difficulties as
under--
(i) there is cascading of taxes as taxes levied by the Central Government are not
available as set off against the taxes being levied by the State Governments;
(ii) certain taxes levied by State Governments are not allowed as set off for payment
of other taxes being levied by them;
(iii) the variety of Value Added Tax Laws in the country with disparate tax rates and
dissimilar tax practices divides the country into separate economic spheres; and
(iv) the creation of tariff and non-tariff barriers such as octroi, entry tax, check posts,
etc., hinder the free flow of trade throughout the country. Besides that, the large
number of taxes create high compliance cost for the taxpayers in the form of number
of returns, payments, etc.
3. In view of the aforesaid difficulties, all the above mentioned taxes are proposed to
be subsumed in a single tax called the goods and services tax which will be levied on
supply of goods or services or both at each stage of supply chain starting from
manufacture or import and till the last retail level. So, any tax that is presently being
levied by the Central Government or the State Governments on the supply of goods or
services is going to be converged in goods and services tax which is proposed to be a
dual levy where the Central Government will levy and collect tax in the form of
central goods and services tax and the State Government will levy and collect tax in
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
78
the form of state goods and services tax on intra-State supply of goods or services or
both.
4. In view of the above, it has become necessary to have a Central legislation, namely
the Central Goods and Services Tax Bill, 2017. The proposed legislation will confer
power upon the Central Government for levying goods and services tax on the supply
of goods or services or both which takes place within a State. The proposed legislation
will simplify and harmonise the indirect tax regime in the country. It is expected to
reduce cost of production and inflation in the economy, thereby making the Indian
trade and industry more competitive, domestically as well as internationally. Due to
the seamless transfer of input tax credit from one W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other
connected matters 18:24:48 stage to another in the chain of value addition, there is
an in-built mechanism in the design of goods and services tax that would incentivise
tax compliance by taxpayers. The proposed goods and services tax will broaden the
tax base, and result in better tax compliance due to a robust information technology
infrastructure.
5. The Central Goods and Services Tax Bill, 2017, inter alia, provides for the
following, namely:--
(a) to levy tax on all intra-State supplies of goods or services or both except supply of
alcoholic liquor for human consumption at a rate to be notified, not exceeding twenty
per cent. as recommended by the Goods and Services Tax Council (the Council);
(b) to broad base the input tax credit by making it available in respect of taxes paid
on any supply of goods or services or both used or intended to be used in the course
or furtherance of business;
(c) to impose obligation on electronic commerce operators to collect tax at source, at
such rate not exceeding one per cent. of net value of taxable supplies, out of payments
to suppliers supplying goods or services through their portals;
(d) to provide for self-assessment of the taxes payable by the registered person;
(e) to provide for conduct of audit of registered persons in order to verify compliance
with the provisions of the Act;
(f) to provide for recovery of arrears of tax using various modes including detaining
and sale of goods, movable and immovable property of defaulting taxable person;
(g) to provide for powers of inspection, search, seizure and arrest to the officers;
(h) to establish the Goods and Services Tax Appellate Tribunal by the Central
Government for hearing appeals against the orders passed by the Appellate Authority
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024

79
or the Revisional Authority;
(i) to make provision for penalties for contravention of the provisions of the proposed
Legislation;
(j) to provide for an anti-profiteering clause in order to ensure that business passes
on the benefit of reduced tax incidence on goods or services or both to the
consumers; and
(k) to provide for elaborate transitional provisions for smooth transition of existing
taxpayers to goods and services tax regime.
6. The Notes on clauses explain in detail the various provisions contained in the Central Goods and
Services Tax Bill, 2017.
7. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives."
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
92. From the aforesaid, it is apparent that the Act, 2017 levies a single tax on the supply of goods or
services on the value addition at each stage of the supply chain from purchase of raw materials,
manufacture of product or import, till the finished good reaches the hands of the consumer. This is
best illustrated by the following example:-
Stages Actions Price+Tax=cost Cost/ Total Tax@10% Total Addition only on price
addition st 1 Purchase of raw - 2000 2000 200 2200 material by manufacturer 2nd
Sold finished goods to 2000+200=2200 500 2700 50 2750 wholesaler (raw material

by Trader 4th Purchase of finished 3150+40=3190 300 3490 30 3520 goods by actual
consumer Total 3200 320 3520
93. The Goods and Service Tax is a destination-based tax and is levied at the point of consumption.
Accordingly, the taxes get accumulated with the original price and due to the effect of Input Tax
Credit, the cascading effect i.e. tax on tax is removed. This is best illustrated by the following
example:-
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 OLD SYSTEM GOODS AND
SERVICES TAX SYSTEM MANUFACTURING COST OF CAR MANUFACTURING
COST OF CAR 250,000 250,000 ADD: PROFIT @20% 50,000 ADD: PROFIT @20%

80
94. Consequently, the intent of the Act, 2017 is to provide a common national market, boost
productivity, increase competitiveness, broaden the tax base and make India a manufacturing hub.
SECTION 171 MANDATES THAT TAX FOREGONE HAS TO BE PASSED ON AS A
COMMENSURATE REDUCTION IN PRICE.
95. As rightly pointed out by the learned Amicus Curiae, the introduction of the system of Goods and
Services Tax was preceded by a comprehensive examination of the subject by different committees
and the reports of such committees had been factored in while finalizing the framework of the
Goods and Services Tax.
96. An area of concern identified in the said reports was that though with the doing away of
multiplicity and cascading of taxes, the prices of goods and services would come down, yet would
this benefit, if any, be passed on to the consumer by the manufacturers and sellers. To ensure that
the benefit is passed on, an anti-profiteering provision in the form of Section 171 of the Act, 2017,
was introduced.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
97. Section 171 of the Act, 2017 mandates that the suppliers shall pass on the benefit of reduction of
the rate of Goods and Services Tax or Input Tax Credits by way of commensurate reduction in prices
to the recipient. Section 171 deals with amounts that the Central and State Governments have
foregone from the public exchequer in favour of the consumers. This Court is of the view that the
amounts foregone from the public exchequer in favour of the consumers cannot be appropriated by
the manufacturers, traders, distributors etc. To allow them to do so would amount to unjust
enrichment. Consequently, when the Goods and Services Tax rate gets reduced or the benefit of
input tax credit, becomes available as a necessary consequence the final price paid by the recipient
obviously requires to be reduced. In the absence of such anti-profiteering provisions, there would be
no legal obligation to pass on the benefit of the Goods and Services Tax regime and, consequently,
the intended objective of reducing overall tax rates and mitigating the cascading effect would not be
achieved.
98. The expression 'profiteered' has been defined in the Explanation to Section 171 of the Act, 2017
to mean 'the amount determined on account of not passing the benefit of reduction in rate of tax on
supply of goods or services or both or the benefit of input tax credit to the recipient by way of
commensurate reduction in the price of the goods or services or both'. According to Collins English
Dictionary - Complete and Unabridged, 12th Edition 2014, the word 'commensurate' means "1.
having the same extent or duration; 2. corresponding in degree, amount, or size; proportionate; 3.
able to be measured by a common standard; commensurable." The word 'commensurate' has been
used in several judgments of the Supreme Court for laying down yardsticks in different contexts,
from determining the rightfulness of the posting of a public servant, to assessing the correctness of
criminal sentencing and calculating maintenance amounts W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 indicating that the Courts too have a clear and definite understanding of this word.
[See: P.K. Chinnasamy v. Govt. of T.N., (1987) 4 SCC 601; Centre for PIL v. Housing & Urban
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024

81
Development Corpn. Ltd., (2017) 3 SCC 605; Dinesh v. State of Rajasthan, (2006) 3 SCC 771; Vimala
(K.) v. Veeraswamy (K.), (1991) 2 SCC 375].
99. The obligation of effecting/making a "commensurate" reduction in prices, as mentioned
hereinabove, is relevant to the underlying objective of the Goods and Services Tax regime which is to
ensure that suppliers pass on the benefits of reduction in the rate of tax and Input Tax Credit to the
consumers, especially since the Goods and Services Tax is a consumption-based tax (as adopted in
India) and the recipient (consumer) practically pays the taxes which are included in the final price.
Section 171 of the Act, 2017, therefore, is not to be looked at as a price control measure but is to be
seen to be directly connected with the objectives of the Goods and Services Tax regime.
Consequently, the word 'commensurate' in Section 171 of the Act, 2017 means that whatever actual
saving arises due to the reduction in rates of tax or the benefit of the Input Tax Credit, in rupee and
paisa terms, must be reflected as equal or near about reduction in price . In other words, tax
foregone by the authorities has to be passed on to the consumer as commensurate reduction in
price.
100. Accordingly, Section 171 of the Act, 2017 has been enacted, in public interest, with the
consumer welfare objective of ensuring that suppliers pass on the benefit of Input Tax Credits and
reduction of rate of Goods and Services Tax to the consumers. The Section does this by firstly
creating a substantive obligation under sub-section (1) requiring manufacturers / suppliers to pass
on benefits of Input Tax Credits and/or reduction in rate of tax by way of commensurate reduction
in prices to the recipients. The said Section further W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters
18:24:48 enables the establishment of an Authority to determine whether Suppliers have passed on
the benefits of Input Tax Credits and reduction of the tax rates, and to exercise such other powers
and functions as may be prescribed.
101. This Court is in agreement with the submission of the Respondents that the objective behind
Section 171 is directly relatable to the Directive Principles of State Policy contained in Article 38(1)
of the Constitution which requires the State to strive to secure a social order in which justice, social,
economic and political shall inform all institutions of the national life and Articles 39(b) and (c) of
the Constitution which require the State to direct its policy towards ensuring that the ownership and
control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to sub-serve the
common good and that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of
wealth and means of production to the common detriment.
102. To summarise, Section 171 of the Act, 2017 mandates that whatever is saved in tax must be
reduced in price. Section 171 of the Act, 2017 incorporates the principle of unjust enrichment.
Accordingly, it has a flavor of consumer welfare regulatory measure, as it seeks to achieve the
primary objective behind the Goods and Services Tax regime i.e. to overcome the cascading effect of
indirect taxes and to reduce the tax burden on the final consumer. Consequently, the judgments of
Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (supra), Indian Carbon Limited (supra), V.V.S. Sugars
(supra) and Shree Bhagwati Steel Rolling Mills v. CCE (supra), relied on by the Petitioners, are not
applicable as they deal with the validity of delegated authority imposing tax/fee or charging interest
on delayed payment of tax in the absence of empowering provision in the statute.

W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 SECTION 171 FALLS WITHIN THE
LAW-MAKING POWER OF THE PARLIAMENT UNDER ARTICLE 246A
103. Article 246A of the Constitution of India defines the source of power as well as the field of
legislation (with respect to goods and services tax) obviating the need to refer to the Seventh
Schedule of the Constitution. Article 246A is available to both the Parliament and the State
Legislatures. The said Article embodies the constitutional principle of simultaneous levy as distinct
from the principle of concurrence. However, the Parliament has the exclusive power to enact Goods
and Services Tax legislation where the supply of goods or services takes place in the course of
inter-State trade or commerce. The Supreme Court in Union of India vs. VKC Footsteps India (P)
Ltd. (supra) has held, 'The One Hundred and First Amendment to the Constitution is a watershed
moment in the evolution of cooperative federalism'.
104. Article 246A of the Constitution of India empowers the Parliament and Legislatures to make
laws 'with respect to' goods and services tax. This expression is similar to that used in Article 246
which empowers the Parliament and State Legislatures to make laws 'with respect to' the various
subject-matters enumerated in the Seventh Schedule. The Supreme Court has consistently held that
the expression 'with respect to' is of wide amplitude and thus, the law making power with regard to
Goods and Services Tax includes all ancillary, incidental and necessary matters. In Welfare
Association, A.R.P., Maharashtra Vs. Ranjit P. Gohil, (2003) 9 SCC 358, the Supreme Court has held
as under:-
"28. The fountain source of legislative power exercised by Parliament or the State
Legislatures is not Schedule 7; the fountain source is Article 246 and other provisions
of the Constitution. The function of the three lists in the Seventh Schedule is merely
to demarcate legislative fields between Parliament and States and not to confer any
legislative power. The several entries mentioned in the three lists are fields of
legislation. The Constitution-makers purposely used general and W.P.(C) 7743/2019
& other connected matters 18:24:48 comprehensive words having a wide import
without trying to particularize. Such construction should be placed on the entries in
the lists as makes them effective; any construction which will result in any of the
entries being rendered futile or otiose must be avoided. That interpretation has
invariably been countenanced by the constitutional jurists, which gives the words
used in every entry the widest- possible amplitude. Each general word employed in
the entries has been held to carry an extended meaning so as to comprehend all
ancillary and subsidiary matters within the meaning of the entry so long as it can be
fairly accommodated subject to an overall limitation that the courts cannot extend
the field of an entry to such an extent as to result in inclusion of such matters as the
framers of the Constitution never intended to be included within the scope of the
entry or so as to transgress into the field of another entry placed in another list.
29. In every case where the legislative competence of a legislature in regard to a
particular enactment is challenged with reference to the entries in the various lists, it
is necessary to examine the pith and substance of the Act and to find out if the matter
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
83
comes substantially within an item in the list. The express words employed in an
entry would necessarily include incidental and ancillary matters so as to make the
legislation effective. The scheme of the Act under scrutiny, its object and purpose, its
true nature and character and the pith and substance of the legislation are to be
focused at. It is a fundamental principle of constitutional law that everything
necessary to the exercise of a power is included in the grant of the power (see the
Constitution Bench decision in Chaturbhai M. Patel v. Union of India [AIR 1960 SC
424 : (1960) 2 SCR 362] )."
(emphasis supplied)
105. In R.S. Joshi, Sales Tax Officer, Gujarat & Ors. vs. Ajit Mills Limited & Anr., (1977) 4 SCC 98, a
Seven-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court clearly held that providing for measures dealing with
aspects of unjustly retained amounts as tax in the concerned statute were necessary / ancillary
aspects connected with the subject of taxation. The relevant portion of the said judgment is
reproduced hereinbelow:-
"13. Bearing in mind the quintessential aspects of the rival contentions, let us stop
and take stock. The facts of the case are plain. The professed object of the law is clear.
The motive of the legislature is irrelevant to castigate an Act as a colourable device.
The interdict on public mischief and the insurance of consumer interests against
likely, albeit, unwitting or "ex abundanti cautela" excesses in the working of a statute
are not merely an ancillary power but surely a necessary obligation of a social welfare
state. One potent prohibitory process for this consummation is to penalize the trader
by casting a no-fault or absolute liability W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 to "cough up" to the State the total "unjust" takings snapped up and
retained by him "by way of tax" where tax is not so due from him, apart from other
punitive impositions to deter and to sober the merchants whose arts of dealing with
customers may include "many a little makes a mickle'. If these steps in reasoning
have the necessary nexus with the power to tax under Entry 54 List II, it passes one's
comprehension how the impugned legislation can be denounced as exceeding
legislative competence or as a "colourable device" or as "supplementary, not
complementary'. But this is precisely what the High Court has done, calling to its aid
passages culled from the rulings of this Court and curiously distinguishing an earlier
Division Bench decision of that very Court -- a procedure which, moderately
expressed, does not accord with comity, discipline and the rule of law. The puzzle is
how minds trained to objectify law can reach fiercely opposing conclusions.

24. In a developing country, with the mass of the people illiterate and below the
poverty line, and most of the commodities concerned constitute their daily
requirements, we see sufficient nexus between the power to tax and the incidental
power to protect purchasers from being subjected to an unlawful burden. Social
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/

justice clauses, integrally connected with the taxing provisions, cannot be viewed as a
mere device or wanting in incidentality. Nor are we impressed with the contention
turning on the dealer being an agent (or not) of the State vis-a-vis sales tax ; and why
should the State suspect when it obligates itself to return the moneys to the
purchasers? We do not think it is more feasible for ordinary buyers to recover from
the common run of dealers small sums than from Government. We expect a sensitive
government not to bluff but to hand back. So, we largely disagree with Ashoka while
we generally agree with Abdul Quader. We must mention that the question as to
whether an amount which is illegally collected as sales tax can be forfeited did not
arise for consideration in Ashoka.
25. We may conclude with the thought that Parliament and the State legislatures will
make haste to inaugurate viable public interest litigation procedures cutting costs
and delays. After all, the reality of rights is their actual enjoyment by the citizen and
not a theoretical set of magnificent grants. "An acre in Middlesex', said Macaulay, "is
better than a principality in Utopia'. Added Prof. Schwartz : "A legal system that
works to serve the community is better than the academic conceptions of a bevy of
Platonic guardians unresponsive to public needs."
(emphasis supplied)
106. Keeping in view the aforesaid, this Court is of the view that the anti- profiteering mechanism as
incorporated in Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is in the exercise of the Parliament's power to legislate
on ancillary and necessary aspects/matters of Goods and Services Tax apart from being a social
welfare W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 measure as it amplifies and extends
the earlier concept of barring persons to undertake exercise of collecting monies from the
consumers by false representation.
107. Consequently, this Court is of the view that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 falls within the
law-making power of the Parliament under Article 246A of the Constitution dealing with the
ancillary and necessary aspects of Goods and Services Tax and is not beyond the legislative
competence of the Parliament.
SECTION 171 LAYS OUT A CLEAR LEGISLATIVE POLICY AND DOES NOT DELEGATE ANY
ESSENTIAL LEGISLATIVE FUNCTION
108. This Court is of the view that Section 171 of the Act 2017 is a complete code in itself and it does
not suffer from any ambiguity or arbitrariness. Section 171 of the Act 2017 sets out the function,
duty, responsibility and power of NAA with exactitude. It stipulates that the pre-conditions for
applicability of the provision are either the event of reduction in rate of tax or the availability of
benefit of input tax credit (resulting in such reduction). Once the said pre- requisites/conditions
exist, the direct consequence contemplated i.e. reduction of the price must follow. Therefore, if
before such reduction of rate of taxes or benefit of Input Tax Credit, the price paid by the recipient
inclusive of the applicable tax at the relevant time was a particular amount, then on account of the
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
85
reduction of the tax rate or the benefit of the Input Tax Credit, there has to be reduction in the
subject price. Further, the reduction in the tax rate or the benefit of Input Tax Credit which is
mandated to be passed on to the recipient is a matter of right for the recipient and consequentially,
the price reduction must be commensurate to such benefit. For instance, when the Goods and
Services Tax rate on a service of Rs.100 is 28%, the MRP of the service at which it is sold to W.P.(C)
7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 the consumer is Rs.128. When the Goods and
Services Tax rate is reduced by the Government from 28% to 18%, the provision requires that this
reduction in Goods and Services Tax rate should be reflected in the price of the service and the
benefit from such reduction of tax rate should be passed on to the consumers by way of
commensurate reduction in the price. As a result, the new MRP of the service should be Rs.118.
109. In Re The Delhi Laws Act AIR (1951) SC 332, while answering the question of what is an
essential legislative function, the Supreme Court held that "the essential legislative function consists
in the determination or choosing of the legislative policy and of formally enacting that policy into a
binding rule of conduct. It is open to the legislature to formulate the policy as broadly and with as
little or as much details as it thinks proper and it may delegate the rest of the legislative work to a
subordinate authority who will work out the details within the framework of that policy."
110. Keeping in view the aforesaid mandate of law, it is apparent that Section 171 of the Act, 2017
lays out a clear legislative policy. This Court is of the view that the necessary navigational tools,
guidelines as well as checks and balances have been incorporated in the provision itself to guide any
authority tasked with ensuring its workability. Consequently, Section 171 of the Act 2017 neither
delegates any essential legislative function nor violates Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
111. As per Section 171(2), the Central Government may, on recommendations of the Council, by
notification, constitute an Authority to examine whether Input Tax Credits availed by any registered
person or the reduction in the tax rate have actually resulted in a commensurate reduction in the
price of the goods or services. Section 171(3) of the Act, 2017 stipulates that the Authority i.e. NAA
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 shall exercise such powers and discharge
such function as may be prescribed. It is in exercise of this power that the Central Government has
enacted Rule 126 of the Rules, 2017 empowering NAA to determine the methodology and procedure
for determining whether the benefit has been passed on to the recipient by way of commensurate
reduction in prices. Consequently, on a conjoint reading of Sections 171(2) and 171(3) of the Act,
2017, it is evident that the powers conferred on NAA by the Central Government under Rule 126 of
the Rules, 2017 were intended by the Legislature to be exercised by the NAA itself. In fact, in
exercise of its powers under Rule 126 of the Rules, 2017, NAA has issued the 'National
Anti-Profiteering Authority: Methodology and Procedure, 2018' dated 28th March, 2018.
112. The Supreme Court in Sahni Silk Mills (P) Ltd. v. ESI Corpn., (1994) 5 SCC 346 while discussing
the maxim of delegatus non potest delegare has held that, "The basic principle behind the aforesaid
maxim is that "a discretion conferred by statute is prima facie intended to be exercised by the
authority on which the statute has conferred it and by no other authority, but this intention may be
negatived by any contrary indications found in the language, scope or object of the statute". (Vide
John Willis, "Delegatus non potest delegare, (1943) 21 Can. Bar Rev. 257, 259)". Therefore, the
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
86
principle of delegatus non potest delegare is not applicable to the present batch of matters.
113. Further, Section 166 of the Act, 2017 provides that every rule made by the Government in
exercise of its powers under Section 164 of the Act, 2017 shall be laid before each house of the
Parliament and that if both Houses agree to make any modification in the rule or both Houses agree
that the rule should not be made, the rule shall thereafter have effect only in such modified form or
be of no effect as the case maybe.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
114. The Supreme Court in D.S. Grewal v. State of Punjab 1958 SCC OnLine SC 9 in respect of a
similar provision in the All-India Services Act, 1951 has observed as follows:
" At the same time Parliament took care to see that these rules were laid on the table
of Parliament for fourteen days before they were to come into force and they were
subject to modification, whether by way of repeal or amendment on a motion made
by Parliament during the session in which they are so laid. This makes it perfectly
clear that Parliament has in no way abdicated its authority, but is keeping strict
vigilance and control over its delegate."
(emphasis supplied) [
115. Consequently, the Executive by framing Rule 126 of the Rules, 2017 has in no manner
encroached upon the jurisdiction of the Parliament. The Petitioners, throughout the hearing of the
case, have repeatedly pointed out that the NAA has adopted varied approaches with regard to
entities dealing with similar products in identical circumstances. If that is the case, then, it may
make the orders passed by NAA bad, but would not invalidate either Section 171 or the Rules framed
thereunder. Further, as the substantive mandate under Section 171(1) is itself a sound guiding
principle for the framing of Rules and the functioning of NAA, the argument that Rule 126 suffers
from excessive delegation is untenable in law.
IMPUGNED PROVISIONS ARE NOT A PRICE FIXING MECHANISM. THEY DO NOT VIOLATE
EITHER ARTICLE 19(1)(g) OR ARTICLE 300A OF THE CONSTITUTION
116. Section 171 of the Act, 2017 does not violate Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India, as it is
not a price-fixing mechanism. As rightly pointed out by the learned counsel for the Respondents,
Section 171 of the Act, 2017 only relates to the indirect-tax component of the price of goods and
services and does not impinge upon the freedom of suppliers to fix their own prices keeping in view
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 relevant commercial and economic factors.
This Court is in agreement with the learned Amicus Curiae that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is solely
focused on ensuring that the consequential benefit of reduction of the rate of tax by the Government
reaches the recipient.
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
87
117. The contention of the petitioners that the fundamental presumption under Section 171 that
every tax reduction must result in 'price reduction' is not correct. The use of the expression 'shall' in
Section 171 of the Act, 2017 means that the supplier is required to pass on the benefit of the reduced
tax rate and the benefit of Input Tax Credit, and that such passing on is to be carried out only by way
of commensurate reduction of price of the goods or services. Accordingly, costing and
market-related factors are irrelevant for NAA, as it is only required to examine whether or not there
is any reduction in tax rate or benefit of accruing Input Tax Credits and if so whether the same has
been passed on by way of commensurate reduction of prices. The NAA is not concerned with the
price determined by a supplier, for the supply of particular goods or services, exclusive of the GST or
Input Tax Credit component. The supplier is at liberty to set his base prices and vary them in
accordance with the relevant commercial and economic factors or any applicable laws.
Consequently, NAA is only mandated to ensure that the benefit of reduced rates of taxes and Input
Tax Credit is passed on. NAA cannot force the petitioners to sell their goods or services at reduced
prices.
118. This Court is of the view that the manufacturer/supplier despite reduction on rate of tax or
benefit of Input Tax Credits can raise the prices based on commercial factors, as long as the same is
not a pretense. During the hearing, Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel, conceded (as recorded
earlier) that in some cases, commercial factors might necessitate an increase in price despite
reduction in rate of tax or increase in availability of benefit of Input Tax Credits.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
119. This Court is in agreement with the submission of learned Amicus Curiae that if there is any
variation on account of other factors, such as any costs necessitating the setting off of such reduction
of price, the same needs to be justified by the supplier. The inherent presumption that these must
necessarily be a reduction in prices of the goods and services is a rebuttable presumption. It is
clarified that if the supplier is to assert reasons for offsetting the reduction, it must establish the
same on cogent basis and must not use it merely as a device to circumvent the statutory obligation of
reducing the prices in a commensurate manner contemplated under Section 171 of the Act, 2017.
120. This Court is further of the view that the present batch of matters deals with amounts that the
Revenue had foregone in favour of the consumers which however had been either wrongfully
appropriated by the petitioners/suppliers and/or used in their business and/or used for
cross-subsidisation and/or passed off as a special discount to the dealer or the consumer. Therefore,
there cannot be any proprietary interest of the suppliers in such amount which the Government has
foregone in favour of consumers by way of reduction in taxes and no legal or constitutional right can
be asserted thereunder.
121. Clearly, Section 171 of the Act, 2017 has been incorporated with the intent of creating a
framework that ensures that the benefit reaches the ultimate consumer. There cannot be any room
for allowing unjust retention of benefit of reduction in rate of tax or benefit of input tax credit with
the manufacturer/supplier/distributor. The reliance placed by the petitioners on the judgment of
CIT vs. B.C. Srinivasa Setty (1981) 2 SCC 460 and CCE vs. Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (2016) 1 SCC 170, is
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
88
completely misconceived as both these judgments were passed specifically in the context of levy of
taxes. As held hereinabove, Section 171 of the Act, 2017 does not levy any tax on supplies and
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 hence these judgments do not apply to the
present batch of matters. Consequently, the impugned provisions are not a price fixing mechanism
and they do not violate either Article 19(1)(g) or Article 14 or Article 300A of the Constitution of
India.
REFERENCE TO ANTI-PROFITEERING PROVISIONS OF AUSTRALIA AND MALAYSIA IS
MISCONCEIVED
122. The reference to Anti-profiteering provisions under the Australian Trade Practices Act by the
petitioners is misplaced as pointed out by the learned counsel for the Respondents and as according
to the petitioner's own submissions, the Australian Act prohibits 'price exploitation' in relation to
the New Tax System i.e. that the Act by its nature regulates prices. This is different from Section 171
of the Act, 2017 which only requires the suppliers to pass on the benefit of tax reduction and Input
Tax Credit to the recipients of the goods and services. The 'price' aspect comes into play in the
context of Section 171 of the Act, 2017 only when it comes to the manner in which the principal
obligation of passing on benefits as aforesaid, is to be carried out i.e., by way of commensurate
reduction of prices. Consequently, in the case of Section 171, there is no intent of any over- riding
regulation on 'price exploitation' like in the case of the Australian Trade Practices Act referred to by
the petitioners.
123. Similarly, the reference made by the petitioners to the Malaysian Price Control and
Anti-Profiteering Act, 2011 is also misplaced as the said Act, according to the petitioner's own
submission, prohibits suppliers from 'making unreasonably high profit'. By its very nature, the
Malaysian Act controls pricing unlike Section 171 of the Act, 2017 which does not seek to regulate
the pricing of the goods and services or the profits of the suppliers. Consequently, the reference to
Anti-Profiteering provisions of Australia and Malaysia is misconceived.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 NO FIXED/UNIFORM METHOD OR
MATHEMATICAL FORMULA CAN BE LAID DOWN FOR DETERMINING PROFITEERING
124. This Court is of the view that no fixed/uniform method or mathematical formula can be laid
down for determining profiteering as the facts of each case and each industry may be different. The
determination of the profiteered amount has to be computed by taking into account the relevant and
peculiar facts of each case. There is 'no one size that fits all' formula or method that can be
prescribed in the present batch of matters. Consequently, NAA has to determine the appropriate
methodology on a case to case basis keeping in view the peculiar facts and circumstances of each
case.
125. It is also well-established that where a power exists to prescribe a procedure and such power
has not been exercised, the implementing authorities are at liberty to determine and adopt such
procedure as they may deem fit subject to the same being fair and reasonable. In Dhanjibhai
Ramjibhai vs. State of Gujarat (1985) 2 SCC 5, the Supreme Court has held, "...Merely because
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
89
procedural rules have not been framed does not imply a negation of the power. In the absence of
such rules, it is sufficient that the power is exercised fairly and reasonably, having regard to the
context in which the power has been granted.". In Chairman & MD, BPL Ltd. vs. S.P. Gururaja and
Ors., (2003) 8 SCC 567, the Supreme Court has held, "....Under the Act or the Regulations framed
thereunder, no procedure for holding such consultations had been laid down. In that situation it was
open to the competent authorities to evolve their own procedure. Such a procedure of taking a
decision upon deliberations does not fall foul of Article 14 of the Constitution of India."
126. Consequently, Rule 126 of the Rules, 2017 to the extent it grants flexibility to NAA to determine
the methodology and procedure to decide whether reduction W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 in rate of tax or benefit of Input Tax Credit has been passed on or not to the
recipient is reasonable and legal. Moreover, as per Rule 126 NAA 'may determine' the methodology
and not 'prescribe' it. The substantive provision i.e. Section 171 of the Act, 2017 itself provides
sufficient guidance to NAA to determine the methodology on a case by case basis depending upon
peculiar facts of each case and the nature of the industry and its peculiarities. Consequently, so long
as the methodology determined by NAA is fair and reasonable, the petitioners cannot raise the
objection that the specifics of the methodology adopted are not prescribed.
127. Since considerable emphasis was laid by learned counsel for the Petitioners on the methodology
adopted by NAA to determine commensurate reduction qua real estate industry, this Court deems it
appropriate to deal with the same at some length. With the introduction of the Goods and Services
Tax scheme/regime, the availability of Input Tax Credit against various goods and services used in
construction has increased or Input Tax Credit was available against more goods and services then
before this resulted in a decrease in the cost of the builders as they now had more Input Tax Credit
available to be set off against Goods and Services Tax paid by them in the Goods and Services Tax
regime as compared to before and the same was not required to be collected from the consumers.
128. There is no dispute with regard to the methodology to be adopted in the following four
scenarios:-
a. If the flat was completely constructed in the pre-Goods and Services Tax period i.e.
before 01st July, 2017 and if it was purchased by making upfront payment of the
whole price in the pre-Goods and Services Tax period no benefit of Input Tax Credit
would be required to be passed on as the price will include W.P.(C) 7743/2019 &
other connected matters 18:24:48 the cost of taxes on which Input Tax Credit was not
available in the pre-Goods and Services Tax period viz. Central Excise Duty, Entry
Tax etc. b. If the construction of the flat had started in the pre-Goods and Services
Tax period and continued/completed in the post-Goods and Services Tax period and
a buyer purchased the flat by making full upfront payment in the post-Goods and
Services Tax period he is entitled to the benefit of Input Tax Credit on the material
which has been purchased in respect of this flat during the post-Goods and Services
Tax period and on which benefit of Input Tax Credit has been availed by the builder.
The builder has to reduce the price commensurately and pass on the benefit. c. If the
construction of the flat is started in the pre-Goods and Services Tax period and its
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
90
construction was continued in the post-Goods and Services Tax period and it was
purchased by the consumer by paying the full amount of price upfront in the pre-
Goods and Services Tax period, the buyer is entitled to claim benefit of Input Tax
Credit on the taxes paid on the construction material purchased by the builder in the
post-Goods and Services Tax period during which he has been given benefit of Input
Tax Credit on the taxes on which Input Tax Credit was not available in the pre-Goods
and Services Tax and cost of such taxes has been built in the price of the flat by the
builder.
d. If the flat is constructed in the post-Goods and Services Tax period and it is
purchased after construction being complete by making upfront payment of the full
price, no benefit of Input Tax W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters
18:24:48 Credit would be available as the price of the flat would have been fixed after
taking into account the Input Tax Credit which has become available to the builder in
the post-Goods and Services Tax period and which was not available to him in the
pre-Goods and Services Tax.
129. However, this Court finds that the methodology adopted by NAA and DGAP to arrive at the
profiteering amount of the real estate industry was generally based on the difference between the
ratio of Input Tax Credit to turnover under the pre-Goods and Services and Tax and post- Goods
and Services and Tax period. This Court is in agreement with the contention of the learned counsel
for the petitioners representing the real estate companies that the methodology adopted by NAA is
flawed as in the real estate sector, there is no direct correlation between the turnover and the Input
Tax Credit availed for a particular period. The expenses in a real estate project are not uniform
throughout the life cycle of the project and the eligibility of credit depends on the nature of the
construction activity undertaken during the particular period. As it is an admitted position that
neither the advances received nor the construction activity is uniform throughout the life cycle of the
project, the accrual of Input Tax Credit is not related to the amount collected from the buyers. This
Court is in agreement with learned counsel of the petitioners that one needs to calculate the total
savings on account of introduction of Goods and Services and Tax for each project and then divide
the same by total area to arrive at the per square feet benefit to be passed on to each flat buyer. This
would ensure that flat-buyers with equal square feet area received equal benefit. The Court, while
hearing the present batch of matters on merits, shall take the aforesaid direction/interpretation into
account.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 IT IS THE PREROGATIVE OF THE
LEGISLATURE TO DECIDE HOW THE BENEFIT IS TO BE PASSED ON TO THE CONSUMERS
130. It is settled law that it is the prerogative of the Legislature to decide the manner as to how the
reduction in rate of tax or the benefit of Input Tax Credit is to be passed on to the consumer. In
Dr.Ashwani Kumar vs. Union of India, (2020) 13 SCC 585, the Supreme court has held as under:-
"11. The legislature as an elected and representative body enacts laws to give effect to
and fulfil democratic aspirations of the people. The procedures applied are designed
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
91
to give careful thought and consideration to wide and divergent interests, voices and
all shades of opinion from different social and political groups. Legislature functions
as a deliberative and representative body. It is directly accountable and answerable to
the electorate and citizens of this country. This representativeness and principle of
accountability is what gives legitimacy to the legislations and laws made by
Parliament or the State Legislatures. Article 245 of the Constitution empowers
Parliament and the State Legislatures to enact laws for the whole or a part of the
territory of India, and for the whole or a part of the State respectively, after due
debate and discussion in Parliament/the State Assembly."
(emphasis supplied)
131. In the present instance, the legislative mandate is that reduction of the tax rate or the benefit of
Input Tax Credit must not only be reflected in reduction of prices but it must also reach the recipient
of the goods or services. Such a mandate cannot be tampered with by the supplier by substituting
the benefit in the form of reduction of actual price with any other form such as increase in volume or
weight or by supply of additional or free material or festival discount like 'Diwali Dhamaka' or
cross-subsidisation.
132. Further, the requirement that the benefit of the rate reduction and Input Tax Credit reach the
final consumer by way of 'cash in hand' through commensurate reduction in prices, cannot be said
to be manifestly arbitrary. No fundamental or other rights of any of the petitioners are being
affected in any manner by W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 requiring that
the benefit in reduction of tax rate or Input Tax Credits, be passed on to the recipients by way of
commensurate reduction in prices.
133. This Court is in agreement with the submission of Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel for the
Respondents, that the benefit of tax reduction has to be passed on at the level of each supply of SKU
to each buyer and in case it is not passed on, the profiteered amount has to be calculated on each
SKU.
134. The contention of the learned counsel for the Petitioners that it is legally impossible to pass on
the benefits by reducing the price of goods in cases of low priced products is untenable in law. As
pointed out by Mr.Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel for the Respondents, the provisions of the Legal
Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 are applicable. In cases for period prior to 31st
December, 2017, the erstwhile Rule 2(m) of the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules,
2011 which provided detailed instructions for rounding off of the MRP would be applicable.
Similarly, Rule 6(1)(e) of the above Rules as amended in 2017 with effect from 01st January, 2018 to
31st March, 2022 provides that the retail price of the package shall clearly indicate that it is the MRP
inclusive of all taxes and the price in rupees and paise be rounded off to the nearest rupee or 50
paise would be applicable. Consequently, there would be no legal impossibility in reducing the MRP
even in such cases. There is nothing inconsistent in Section 171 with such rounding off.

92
ACT 2017 RIGHTLY DOES NOT FIX A TIME PERIOD DURING WHICH PRICE-REDUCTION HAS
TO BE OFFERED
135. This Court is in agreement with the submissions of the respondents and the learned Amicus
Curiae that bearing in mind the very nature of the Act, 2017, it is not proper or feasible to
contemplate any specific period of time for application of W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 the reduced price, as the same has to take effect so long as the direct relation
between the reduction of tax rate or the benefit of Input Tax Credits exists and there is no other
factor effecting/countering the same. If, conceptually, the reduction of tax rate has taken place on a
specified date and there are no justified variations in the cost price or other factors for offsetting
such reduction in the prices for a particular period of time, clearly for that period a reduced price
must govern the transaction. This Court is of the view that providing for a particular period of time
for operation of the provisions would be not be in conformity with the scheme and intent of the Act,
2017 itself.
SECTION 64A OF SALE OF GOODS ACT IS NOT APPLICABLE TO THE OBLIGATION UNDER
SECTION 171
136. This Court is in agreement with the submission of learned counsel for the Respondents that
Section 64A of Sale of Goods Act, 1930 has no applicability to the obligation under Section 171 of the
Act, 2017 as the former only confers a discretion on the buyer to reduce the contract price to the
extent of reduction in taxes, whereas Section 171 imposes a positive obligation on the supplier to
make a commensurate reduction in the price when the Government reduces the rate of tax.
Therefore there is no inconsistency between the two laws.
137. Moreover, the CGST/SGST Acts, 2017 are independent Acts and there is no provision under
these Acts that tax reduction ordered under these Acts would be subject to the provisions of Sale of
Goods Act, 1930 or the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Tax reduction is given by sacrificing tax revenue
and hence the Governments are legally competent to direct the suppliers to pass on the benefit of
such tax reduction to the consumers after its notification. Any contract made in violation of public
policy of passing on the benefit would be void. Consequently, W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 all contracts (a) whether they are pending to be performed or (b) executed after
tax reduction and/or (c) have already been concluded before tax reduction, have to implemented
keeping in view the mandate enshrined in Section 171 of the Act, 2017.
A STATUTORY PROVISION CANNOT BE STRUCK DOWN ON THE GROUND OF POSSIBILITY
OF ABUSE
138. During the course of hearing, learned counsel for the petitioners advanced a number of
hypothetical situations to suggest that there is a possibility of abuse of Section 171 of the Act, 2017.
However, it is settled law that Acts and their provisions are not to be declared unconstitutional on
the fanciful theory that power would be exercised in an unrealistic fashion or in a vacuum or on the
ground that there is an apprehension of misuse of statutory provision or possibility of abuse of
power. It must be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that administration and application of a
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
93
particular law would be done "not with an evil eye and unequal hand". Some of the relevant
Supreme Court judgments are reproduced hereinbelow:-
A. In Maganlal Chhaganlal (P) Ltd. Vs. Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay &
Ors., (1974) 2 SCC 402 it has been held as under:-
"15.....The statute itself in the two classes of cases before us clearly lays down the
purpose behind them, that is that premises belonging to the Corporation and the
Government should be subject to speedy procedure in the matter of evicting
unauthorized persons occupying them. This is a sufficient guidance for the
authorities on whom the power has been conferred. With such an indication clearly
given in the statutes one expects the officers concerned to avail themselves of the
procedures prescribed by the Acts and not resort to the dilatory procedure of the
ordinary civil court. Even normally one cannot imagine an officer having the choice
of two procedures, one which enables him to get possession of the property quickly
and the other which would be a prolonged one, to resort to the latter. Administrative
officers, no less than the courts, do not function in a vacuum. It would be extremely
unreal to hold that an administrative officer would in taking W.P.(C) 7743/2019 &
other connected matters 18:24:48 proceedings for eviction of unauthorised occupants
of Government property or Municipal property resort to the procedure prescribed by
the two Acts in one case and to the ordinary civil court in the other. The provisions of
these two Acts cannot be struck down on the fanciful theory that power would be
exercised in such an unrealistic fashion. In considering whether the officers would be
discriminating between one set of persons and another, one has got to take into
account normal human behaviour and not behaviour which is abnormal. It is not
every fancied possibility of discrimination but the real risk of discrimination that we
must take into account. This is not one of those cases where discrimination is writ
large on the face of the statute. Discrimination may be possible but is very
improbable. And if there is discrimination in actual practice this Court is not
powerless. Furthermore, the fact that the Legislature considered that the ordinary
procedure is insufficient or ineffective in evicting unauthorised occupants of
Government and Corporation property and provided a special speedy procedure
therefore is a clear guidance for the authorities charged with the duty of evicting
unauthorised occupants. We, therefore, find ourselves unable to agree with the
majority in the Northern India Caterers case."
(emphasis supplied) B. In Collector of Customs v. Nathella Sampathu Chetty, 1962 SCC OnLine SC
30 , the Supreme Court has held as under:-
"34....This Court has held in numerous rulings, to which it is unnecessary to refer,
that the possibility of the abuse of the powers under the provisions contained in any
statute is no ground for declaring the provision to be unreasonable or void. *** The
possibility of abuse of a statute otherwise valid does not impart to it any element of
invalidity. The converse must also follow that a statute which is otherwise invalid as
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
94
being unreasonable cannot be saved by its being administered in a reasonable
manner. The constitutional validity of the statute would have to be determined on the
basis of its provisions and on the ambit of its operation as reasonably construed. If so
judged it passes the test of reasonableness, possibility of the powers conferred being
improperly used is no ground for pronouncing the law itself invalid and similarly if
the law properly interpreted and tested in the light of the requirements set out in Part
III of the Constitution does not pass the test it cannot be pronounced valid merely
because it is administered in a manner which might not conflict with the
constitutional requirements. In saying this we are not to be understood as laying
down that a law which might operate, harshly but still be constitutionally valid
should be operated always with harshness or that reasonableness and justness ought
not to guide the actual administration of such laws."
(emphasis supplied) W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 C. In Mafatlal
Industries Ltd. v. Union of India, (1997) 5 SCC 536, a nine Judge Bench of the Supreme Court while
considering the validity of provisions of the Central Excise and Customs Law (Amendment) Act,
1991 has held as under:-
"88.....It is equally well-settled that mere possibility of abuse of a provision by those
in charge of administering it cannot be a ground for holding the provision
procedurally or substantively unreasonable. In Collector of Customs v. Nathella
Sampathu Chetty [(1962) 3 SCR 786 : AIR 1962 SC 316] , this Court observed:
"The possibility of abuse of a statute otherwise valid does not impart to it any element
of invalidity." It was said in State of Rajasthan v. Union of India [(1977) 3 SCC 592 :
(1978) 1 SCR 1] (SCR at p. 77), "it must be remembered that merely because power
may sometimes be abused, it is no ground for denying the existence of power. The
wisdom of man has not yet been able to conceive of a government with power
sufficient to answer all its legitimate needs and at the same time incapable of
mischief". (Also see Commr., H.R.E. v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri
Shirur Mutt [1954 SCR 1005 : AIR 1954 SC 282] (SCR at p. 1030)."
(emphasis supplied) TO NOT COMPARE TAXES LEVIED AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF THE
ACT, 2017 WITH A BASKET OF DISTINCT INDIRECT TAXES APPLICABLE BEFORE THE
OPERATION OF THE ACT WOULD GO AGAINST THE INTENT AND OBJECTIVE OF ACT, 2017.
139. Prior to coming into force of the Act, 2017, several taxes were levied on goods and services by
the Central Government (such as Central Excise tax, Service tax, Central Sales tax etc.) and by the
State Government (such as Value Added tax, Luxury tax, Purchase tax etc.). There was multiplicity
of taxes as they were levied on the same supply system. This had a cascading effect as there was no
provision for set off. The Hon'ble Prime Minister at the launch of Goods and Services Tax stated "If
we take into consideration the 29 states, the 7 Union Territories, the 7 taxes of the Centre and the 8
taxes of the States, and several different taxes for different commodities, the number of taxes sum
up to a figure W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 of 500! Today all those taxes
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
95
will be shred off to have ONE NATION, ONE TAX right from Ganganagar to Itanagar and from Leh
to Lakshdweep".
140. Additionally, a plethora of non-tariff barriers like octroi, entry tax, check posts etc. hindered
free flow of trade throughout the country and this entailed a high compliance cost for taxpayers. The
Act, 2017 has subsumed the earlier catena of indirect taxes (Central as well as State indirect taxes),
inasmuch as, it levies a single tax on the supply of goods and services. Consequently, the submission
of learned senior counsel for the Petitioner in W.P.(C) 1171/2020 that Section 171(1) of the Act, 2017
does not contemplate a comparison of the taxes levied after the introduction of the Act, 2017 with a
basket of distinct indirect taxes applicable on goods and services before the operation of the Act goes
against the grain, intent and object of the Act, 2017.
THERE IS NO VESTED RIGHT OF APPEAL AND AN APPEAL IS A CREATURE OF THE STATUTE
141. As discussed earlier, Rule 129 of the Rules, 2017 provides for a comprehensive mechanism for
initiation and conduct of proceedings relating to anti-profiteering. The conscious provisioning of
different layers of examination which, in the first place, is purely fact-based clearly demonstrates
that appropriate precautions and redressal measures are provided for in the Scheme of the Act, 2017
read with the Rules, 2017 in connection therewith on the subject of Anti- Profiteering. Consequently,
there is no basis for contending that unbrindled powers have been given to the Authority or that
there is a lack of appropriate redressal mechanism under the Scheme.
142. In any event, it is well settled that there is no vested right of appeal and an appeal is a creature
of the Statute. Right of appeal is neither a natural nor an inherent right vested in a party. It is a
substantive statutory right regulated by the W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
Statute creating it. To provide for an appeal or not under a Statute is a pure question of legislative
policy (See: Kondiba Dagadu Kadam v. Savitribai Sopan Gujar (1999) 3 SCC 722 and Kashmir Singh
v. Harnam Singh (2008) 12 SCC
796).
143. If Legislature chooses not to provide for a right to appeal against an order of the authority that
itself cannot be a ground to declare an enactment as unconstitutional. This Court in Wing
Commander Shyam Naithani vs. Union of India and Ors., W.P.(C) 6483/2021 & connected matters,
2022 SCC OnLine Del 769 has held as under:
"40. However, this Court would like to clarify that a right to appeal is a creation of
Statute and it cannot be claimed as a matter of right. The right to appeal has to exist.
It cannot be created by acquiescence of the parties or by the order of the Court. It is
neither a natural nor an inherent right attached to the litigant being a substantive,
statutory right. [See: United Commercial Bank Ltd. v. Their Workmen, AIR 1951 SC
230; Kondiba Dagdu Kodam v. Savitribai Sopan Gujar, AIR 1999 SC 2213; and UP
Power Corporation Ltd. v. Virenddra Lal, (2013) 10 SCC 39]. Jurisdiction cannot be
conferred by mere acceptance, acquiescence, consent or by any other means as it can
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
96
be conferred only by the legislature as conferring jurisdiction upon a Court or
Authority, is a legislative function..."
(emphasis supplied)
144. Further, the decisions of NAA are subject to judicial review under Article 226 before the
jurisdictional High Courts as is evident from the fact that several petitions have been filed before
this Court challenging orders of the NAA. This shows that the affected parties are exercising their
right to seek remedies under Article 226 against orders of NAA.
145. Consequently, a robust mechanism in conformity with the constitutional requirements is in
place for dealing with grievances of breach of Section 171(1) of the Act, 2017 and hence, it cannot be
said that there is no judicial oversight over the decisions of NAA [See: CCI v. SAIL (supra), Shiv
Shakti Coop. Housing Society v. Swaraj Developers, (2003) 6 SCC 659].
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT OF
JUDICIAL MEMBER IN NAA
146. By its very nature, Section 171(1) of the Act, 2017 clearly lays down the express issues which
need to be examined by the Authority and this examination is in the nature of a fact-finding
exercise. Therefore, the mandate of the Authority is very specific in nature and is akin to a
fact-finding exercise. This Court is of the opinion that NAA is primarily a fact-finding body which is
required to investigate whether suppliers have passed on the benefit to their recipients by way of
reduced prices as mandated by Section 171 of the Act, 2017. On examining the role and duties of
NAA under Section 171(2) of the Act, 2017 and Rule 127 of the Rules, 2017, it is apparent that NAA
performs functions that are to be discharged by domain experts.
147. Even otherwise NAA has not assumed any jurisdiction which was hitherto being exercised by
the High Court or any other judicial body, and so, the principle that there must be a judicial member
in quasi-judicial entities as laid down in the decisions relied upon by the petitioners does not apply
in the present batch of matters.
148. In the case of Namit Sharma vs. Union of India (2013) 1 SCC 745, the Supreme Court
considered the question of the requirement of a judicial member for performing the functions and
exercising the powers of the Chief Information Commissioner. The Supreme Court initially held that
the Information Commission and the Central Information Commissioners perform judicial
functions possessing the essential attributes and trappings of a court and hence, it must have
judicial members. However, while deciding the review petition filed by the Union of India, the
Supreme Court in its judgment reported as Union of India vs. Namit Sharma (2013) 10 SCC 359 has
held that "the powers exercised W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 by the
Information Commissions under the Act were not earlier vested in the High Court or subordinate
court or any other court and are not in any case judicial powers and therefore the legislature need
not provide for appointment of judicial members in the Information Commission."
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
97
149. Similarly, statutory bodies like TRAI, Medical Council of India, Institute of Chartered
Accountant of India etc., perform quasi-judicial functions but do not have judicial members.
Furthermore, Assessing Officers, CIT(Appeals) and the Dispute Resolution Panel under the Income
Tax Act, 1961 all perform quasi- judicial functions but there is no requirement that such members
must possess either a law degree or have judicial experience. Consequently, this Court is of the view
that there is no requirement for a judicial member in NAA.
150. While this Court is in agreement with the submission of the Petitioners that the provision of a
second or casting vote to the Chairman in the event of a tie/equality of votes as was given in Rule
134(2) of the Rules, 2017 is impermissible, yet as the Respondents have stated that the said
provision has never been used, this Court does not deem it necessary to delve into a detailed
discussion of the same.
151. Additionally, the Petitioners have challenged the validity of the constitution of the NAA on
account of absence of a gazette notification as allegedly required under Section 171(2) of the Act,
2017. This Court is of the opinion that this issue does not affect the constitutional validity of the
impugned section which is presently under consideration and so this issue is not being dealt with in
the present judgment.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 RULE 124 IS IN CONSONANCE WITH
ARTICLE 50. THERE IS NO SCOPE FOR GOVERNMENTAL INTERFERENCE IN FUNCTIONS
EXERCISED BY NAA
152. This Court is of the view that Rule 124 of the Rules, 2017 is in consonance with Article 50 of the
Constitution, inasmuch as, selection to NAA is made on the recommendation by a Selection
Committee constituted by the Goods and Services Tax Council which is a constitutional body.
Similarly the services of the Chairperson and members of NAA can be terminated only with the
approval of the Chairman of the Goods and Services Tax Council. Consequently, the members of
NAA are free to carry out their function as they deem fit and there is no scope whatsoever for any
Governmental interference in the functions exercised by NAA.
RULE 133 TO THE EXTENT IT PROVIDES FOR LEVY OF INTEREST AND PENALTY IS WITHIN
THE RULE MAKING POWER OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
153. This Court is of the view that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is broad enough to empower the
Central Government to prescribe penalty and interest to ensure that the suppliers are deterred from
pocketing the benefits meant for the consumers when taxes are foregone by the Government. Merely
empowering NAA to direct returning of the amounts so pocketed by the supplier/registered person
would not have a sufficient deterrent effect on deviant behavior unless interest and penalty are
levied to prevent such actions from taking place in the first place. The width and amplitude of
Section 171 by which the authority is empowered to ensure that reduction in tax rate or the Input
Tax Credit availed results in commensurate reduction in the price of goods or services clearly
encompasses within it the power to ensure that such conduct which leads to profiteering does not
take place.
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
98
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
154. Section 164 of the Act, 2017 gives power to the Government to make rules for carrying out
provisions of the Act and in particular to provide for penalty. Section 164 of the Act, 2017 is
reproduced hereinbelow:-
"164. Power of Government to make rules (1) The Government may, on the
recommendations of the Council, by notification, make rules for carrying out the
provisions of this Act.
(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of sub-section (1), the
Government may make rules for all or any of the matters which by this Act are
required to be, or may be, prescribed or in respect of which provisions are to be or
may be made by rules.
(3) The power to make rules conferred by this section shall include the power to give
retrospective effect to the rules or any of them from a date not earlier than the date
on which the provisions of this Act come into force.
(4) Any rules made under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) may provide that a
contravention thereof shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding ten thousand rupees."
155. Accordingly, Rule 133(3)(b)&(d) of the Rules, 2017 which empower the authority to levy
interest @ 18% from the date of collection of the higher amount till the date of the return of such
amount as well as imposition of penalty are intra vires and within the Rule making power of the
Central Government.
156. Moreover, as pointed out by Mr. Zoheb Hossain, the show cause notices initiating penalty
proceedings in relation to violation of Section 171(1) prior to the coming into force of Section
171(3A), have been withdrawn by NAA and penalty proceedings in all such cases are not being
pressed. Consequently, this issue has become infructuous.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 GOODS AND SERVICES TAX
COLLECTED ON THE ADDITIONAL REALIZATION HAS RIGHTLY BEEN INCLUDED IN THE
PROFITEERED AMOUNT
157. Both the Central as well as the State Government had no intent of collecting additional Goods
and Services Tax on the higher price as they had sacrificed their revenue in favour of the buyer. By
compelling the buyers to pay the additional Goods and Services Tax on a higher price, the supplier
has not only defeated the intent of the Governments but has also acted against the interest of the
consumer and therefore, the Goods and Services Tax collected by him on the additional realization
has rightly been included in the profiteered amount.
TIME LIMIT FOR FURNISHING OF REPORT BY DGAP IS DIRECTORY AND NOT MANDATORY
Acme Housing India Pvt. Ltd. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77311522/
99
158. In some cases, the Petitioners have pointed out that the timelines as provided in the Rules, 2017
have not been followed. They further contended that as a result, the proceedings are vitiated.
However, it is important to note that the Rules, 2017 do not provide any consequences in case the
time limits provided thereunder lapse. As held earlier, the anti-profiteering provisions in the Act,
2017 and the Rules, 2017 are in the nature of a beneficial legislation as they promote consumer
welfare. The Courts have consistently held that beneficial legislation must receive liberal
construction that favors the consumer and promotes the intent and objective of the Act. That being
the scenario, it cannot be said that the proceedings as a whole abate on lapse of time limit of
furnishing of report by DGAP. The Supreme Court in P.T. Rajan Vs. T.P.M. Sahir and Ors. (2003) 8
SCC 498 has held that "It is well-settled principle of law that where a statutory functionary is asked
to perform a statutory duty within the time prescribed W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 therefore, the same would be directory and not mandatory." and that "a provision
in a statute which is procedural in nature although employs the word "shall" may not be held to be
mandatory if thereby no prejudice is caused." Consequently, the time limit provided for furnishing
of report by DGAP is directory in nature and not mandatory.
EXPANSION OF INVESTIGATION BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE COMPLAINT IS NOT ULTRA
VIRES THE STATUTE
159. Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is widely worded and does not limit the scope of examination to
only goods and services in respect of which a complaint is received. The scope of powers of the
DGAP is provided for in Rule 129 of the Rules, 2017. From a reading of the said Rule especially the
expression 'any supply of goods or services' used in sub-rule (2) of Rule 129, it is apparent that the
scope of the DGAP's powers is very wide and is not limited to the goods or services in relation to
which a Complaint is received. The word 'any' includes within its scope 'some' as well as 'all'.
160. In any event, the ignorance of the consumer or lack of information or surrounding complexity
in the supply chain cannot be permitted to defeat the objective of a consumer welfare regulatory
measure and it is in this light that the subject provision is required to be construed.
161. In the context of similar powers of investigation exercised by the Director General under the
Competition Act, 2002, the Supreme Court in Excel Crop Care Ltd. vs. Competition Commission of
India, (2017) 8 SCC 47, has held that the Director General would be well within its powers to
investigate and report on matters not covered by the complaint or the reference order of the
Commission, and an interpretation to the contrary would render the entire purpose of investigation
nugatory. The High Court of Delhi in Cadila Healthcare Ltd. & W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other
connected matters 18:24:48 Anr. vs. CCI & Ors., (2018) SCCOnline Del 11229, relying on the
judgment of the Supreme Court in Excel Crop Care (supra) has clarified in express terms that the
scope of investigation by the Director General is not restricted to the matter stated in the Complaint
and includes other allied as well as unenumerated matters. Consequently, the expansion of
investigation or proceedings beyond the scope of the complaint is not ultra vires the statute.

162. Before parting with the present batch of matters, this Court places on record its appreciation for
the assistance rendered by all the learned counsel, who appeared, in particular, Mr. Amar Dave,
learned Amicus Curiae, Mr. V. Lakshmikumaran and Mr. Zoheb Hossain, Advocates as they filed not
only multiple written submissions but also ensured that hearing in the present batch of matters
(exceeding 100 cases) was conducted in an orderly and proper manner.
TO SUM UP
163. Keeping in view the aforesaid conclusions, the constitutional validity of Section 171 of Act, 2017
as well as Rules 122, 124, 126, 127, 129, 133 and 134 of the Rules, 2017 is upheld. This Court clarifies
that it is possible that there may be cases of arbitrary exercise of power under the anti-profiteering
mechanism by enlarging the scope of the proceedings beyond the jurisdiction or on account of not
considering the genuine basis of variations in other factors such as cost escalations on account of
which the reduction stands offset, skewed input credit situations etc. However, the remedy for the
same is to set aside such orders on merits. What will be struck down in such cases will not be the
provision itself which invests such power on the concerned authority but the erroneous application
of the power.

W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE
PETITIONERS
4. Mr. P. Chidambaram, Mr. S. Ganesh, Mr. Tarun Gulati, Mr. Chinmoy Pradip Sharma and
Mr.Pritesh Kapoor, learned Senior counsel as well as Mr. V. Lakshmikumaran, Mr. Monish Panda,
Mr. Rohan Shah, Mr. Abhishek A. Rastogi, Mr. Tushar Jarwal, Mr. Sparsh Bhargava, Mr. Puneet
Aggarwal, Mr. Sujit Ghosh, Mr. K. S. Suresh, Mr. Nikhil Gupta, Mr. Shashank Shekhar and Mr.
Priyadarshi Manish, learned counsel addressed arguments on behalf of the petitioners.
5. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that Section 171(1) of the Act, 2017 and the Rules
126, 127 and 133 of the Rules, 2017 framed thereunder are unconstitutional as they are beyond the
legislative competence of Parliament. They submitted that the impugned provisions do not fall
within the law-making power of Parliament under Article 246A of the Constitution of India.
6. Some of the learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the anti- profiteering provision, as
provided under Section 171 of the Act, 2017, is in the nature of a tax or financial exaction. They
submitted that a tax can be levied from a subject only if there is a specific and unequivocal provision
in the parent statute authorising such an exaction. According to them, such a financial exaction
cannot be made lawfully by a subordinate legislation, when there is no empowering provision in the
parent statute. In support of their submissions, they relied on the decisions of the Supreme Court in
Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority v. Sharakumar Jayantikumar Pasawala, (1992) 3 SCC
285 and V.V.S. Sugars v. Govt. of A.P., (1999) 4 SCC 192.
7. Learned counsel for the petitioners further submitted that the impugned Section and Rules suffer
from vice of excessive delegation as they delegate essential legislative functions to the Government.
Additionally, they submitted W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 that the
impugned provisions are ambiguous, arbitrary, violative of Article 14 and confer excessive powers
on NAA to determine profiteering as no guidelines and/or legislative policy for the exercise of such
powers by the authority so constituted have been laid down in the statute. They submitted that the
failure to provide clear statutory guidance for exercise of powers by NAA in the formulation of such
methodology amounts to "delegation of essential legislative function" as these formulations were
essential and therefore, the same should have been stipulated by the Legislature. They submitted
that it is settled law that the legislative authority cannot be delegated under a statute without
appropriate guidelines or safeguards. In support of their submissions, they relied on the judgment
of the Supreme Court in Ramesh Birch vs. Union of India, 1989 Supp SCC 430.
8. They submitted that it is settled law that delegatus non potest delegare which essentially means
that a delegatee cannot further delegate unless expressly or impliedly authorized. They contended
that the Legislature vide Section 171 of the Act, 2017 delegated the authority to determine/prescribe
powers and functions of NAA to the Executive i.e. the Government of India. They submitted that the
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
53
Government of India by way of Rule 126 of the Rules, 2017, contrary to the legislative mandate
contained in Section 171 of the Act, 2017, further delegated the power to NAA to determine the
methodology and procedure for determining whether the reduction in taxes or the benefit of Input
Tax Credit had been passed on to the recipients. They stated that even NAA did not issue any
guidelines as to how to determine profiteering. In support of their submission, they relied on the
judgment of the Supreme Court in Barium Chemicals Ltd. & Ors. v Company Law Board & Ors. [AIR
1967 SC 295].
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
9. They submitted that the term 'commensurate' is not defined in the Act, 2017 and the expression
'profiteering' in Section 171 is dependent upon the scope and meaning of the phrase 'commensurate
reduction in the price'. According to them, as a result of this circular reasoning, NAA had complete
and unfettered discretion to determine the extent of profiteering. They pointed out that the
definition of profiteering inserted by way of amendment (that came into force only on 01st January,
2020) is vague and uncertain as to how the amount of profiteering or commensurate reduction in
price has to be determined and therefore, the same is ex facie arbitrary and violative of Articles 14
and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. They pointed out that even NAA, in the orders passed by it,
had not been consistent in its interpretation of the term "commensurate reduction".
10. They stated that without stipulating the specifics of the methodology to be adopted to determine
profiteering, the petitioners could not have been asked to reduce prices. They contrasted the lack of
guidelines in Section 171 of the Act, 2017 with Section 9A of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 which lays
down the broad guidelines on the basis of which the extent of dumping and anti-dumping duty is to
be quantified and Section 19(3) of the Competition Act, 2002, which lays down the factors to be
taken into consideration while determining whether an agreement has an appreciable adverse effect.
They stated that in the absence of any guidelines, NAA had acted arbitrarily as is evident from the
varied approaches taken by it while adjudicating cases of entities belonging to the same industry and
dealing with similar products.
11. Learned counsel for the petitioners emphasised that the formula used by the respondents, for
instance, for real estate companies during the course of investigation/adjudication, had not been
notified. They stated that the W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 methodology
adopted by NAA and the Director General of Anti-Profiteering ('DGAP') to arrive at the profiteering
amount of the real estate industry was generally based on the difference between the ratio of Input
Tax Credit to turnover under the pre-Goods and Services Tax and post-Goods and Services Tax
period. To drive home the point that the methodology adopted by the respondents was flawed, the
learned counsel for the petitioners gave an illustration of the contrasting results one would get after
calculating the amount profiteered/required to be passed on in case of two identical real estate
projects being developed by Developers A & B with the only difference being the advance payment
received by them prior to the Goods and Services Tax Regime. They stated that assuming that two
Developers (A & B) commenced construction of the two identical projects (having hundred flats of
rupees one crore each) in 2017 and the projects were executed at an identical pace with identical
inputs and with Developer A receiving sixty per cent of the amount (total sale price of the project) as
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
54
advance during the pre-Goods and Services Tax period, Developer B receiving only twenty per cent
as advance during that period, with all other factors being identical (like the credit availed/available
during the pre-Goods and Services Tax period), the credit to turnover ratio for the two projects
would vary drastically depending on the time when the payments from the customers were received.
According to the petitioners, if the methodology adopted by NAA /DGAP is to be accepted,
Developer A would be required to pass on 15% benefit to the flat- buyers and Developer B who
received 80% of the payment/amount post-Goods and Services Tax receive would be required to
pass no benefit to the flat-buyers. A graphical representation of the same, as furnished by the
petitioners, is as follows:
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
12. They stated that it is for this reason, the percentage of credit to turnover ratio (in Goods and
Services Tax regime) had varied from 0.2% (in Vatika Limited, Case No. 64/2019) to 20.98% (in
Emaar MGF Land Ltd, Case No. 26/2020) in the orders passed by NAA.
13. Learned counsel for the petitioners in Writ Petition No. 13657/2022 pointed out that DLF
calculated the total savings on account of introduction of Goods and Services Tax for each project.
He stated that the total savings/benefits were then divided by total area to arrive at the per square
feet benefit to be passed on to each flat buyer. He stated that as a result the flat-buyers with equal
area received equal benefit. In contrast to this, he pointed out that the NAA/DGAP calculated the
benefit by comparison of ratios as explained above and then computed the profiteered amount as a
percentage of consideration received from each flat-buyer in the Goods and Services Tax regime.
Therefore, as per NAA/DGAP, similarly placed flat-buyers received inconsistent benefits. For the
project Camellias, the benefits computed by both NAA/DGAP & DLF are tabulated below:

14. They also submitted that determination of profiteering can be made at different
levels such as entity level, Stock Keeping Unit (hereinafter referred to as 'SKU') level,
product level, customer level etc. Hence, an assessee intending to W.P.(C) 7743/2019
& other connected matters 18:24:48 comply with the law has no way of ensuring
whether its methodology is in compliance with Section 171(1) of the Act, 2017 or not.
15. Learned counsel for the petitioners also submitted that the operation of Section
171 of the Act, 2017 amounted to price-fixing and is therefore violative of Articles
19(1)(g) and 300A of the Constitution. They submitted that according to NAA's
interpretation of Section 171 of the Act, 2017, once any of the events contemplated in
Section 171 of the Act, 2017 occurs, i.e. either there is reduction in tax rate or benefit
of Input Tax Credit is availed, then the price of the product must be adjusted to (a)
the extent of the tax reduced and/or (b) the extent of increase in the credit
availability. They stated that there is no clarity on adjustments allowed on account of
rise either in input costs or in customs duty on import of inputs, supply and demand
conditions and other factors which impact pricing. They submitted that Section 171 of
the Act, 2017, to the extent it eliminates all factors from consideration in price
fixation, other than the rate of tax and credit availability, was clearly excessive,
disproportionate and unwarranted.
16. They pointed out that similar anti-profiteering provisions had been introduced in
Australia (in 2000) and in Malaysia (in 2015) to ensure that the benefit of reduction
of tax rate was passed on to the recipients. They stated that the provisions so
introduced prescribed clear policy guidelines before imposing the restrictive
conditions.
17. They stated that when Australia implemented the Goods and Services Tax
replacing the erstwhile Wholesale Sales Tax, the Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission ('ACCC') was entrusted with the responsibility to oversee
pricing responses to the introduction of Goods and Services Tax for a period of three
years between 1999 and 2002. They stated that Section 75AU of W.P.(C) 7743/2019
& other connected matters 18:24:48 the Trade Practices Act, 1974 which prohibited
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
56
price exploitation in relation to the New tax System provided that factors such as
increase in supplier's input costs, supply and demand conditions and other relevant
factors shall be taken into consideration while determining price exploitation. They
further stated that Section 75AV(1) of the aforesaid Act provided that the ACCC must
formulate detailed guidelines to explain when prices may be regarded to be in
contravention of the price exploitation provision. They stated that the ACCC had
framed detailed guidelines in July, 1999 which were later revised in March, 2000
after taking inputs from all stakeholders. It was pointed out that the fundamental
principle laid down in the aforesaid guidelines was based on a 'net dollar margin
rule'. According to them, the said guidelines enumerated all the relevant factors to be
taken into consideration for price adjustments and provided for considering the
increase in procurement cost and additional costs due to the tax change. They stated
that it also allowed averaging the impact of taxes and costs across goods or services
under specific circumstances.
18. While referring to the Goods and Services Tax system introduced in Malaysia,
they stated that the Anti- Profiteering measures had been incorporated under the
Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act, 2011 to control prices of goods, charges of
services and to prohibit unreasonably high profiteering by suppliers. They stated that
making unreasonably high profit was an offence under Section 14 of the said Act.
They further stated that Section 15 of the said Act provided that the Minister shall
prescribe the mechanism to determine whether the profit is unreasonably high
considering different conditions and taking into consideration factors such as: tax
imposition, suppliers' cost, supply and demand conditions and other relevant matters
in relation or price of goods and services W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 etc. It was pointed out that detailed guidelines were laid down
under the Regulations issued in 2014 and 2016.
19. Learned counsel for the petitioners further submitted that Section 171 of the Act,
2017 is manifestly arbitrary and unreasonable, as it does not fix a period of time
during which the reduced prices of the goods and services had to be maintained. They
emphasised that the time-frame for which an assessee could be subject to the
discipline of Section 171 of the Act, 2017 has been left undefined and open-ended.
According to them, this indefinite obligation hinders the petitioners' right to trade
and commerce and hence, the same is violative of Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the
Constitution of India.
20. They further stated that price reduction is not the only method by which
commensurate benefit can be passed on to the recipient. They stated that an increase
in the volume or weight of the product being sold for the same price is an equally
effective and legal way of commensurately reducing the price of the product. They
stated that mandating price reduction as the only way to pass the commensurate
benefit to the recipient is manifestly arbitrary and unreasonable.

21. Learned counsel for the petitioner in W.P.(C) 12557/2022, M/s. L'Oreal India Pvt.
Ltd., stated that in the FMCG industry, for low priced products, since the resultant
reduction in price is often miniscule, it was not feasible to pass on the benefit because
of the restriction in the Legal Metrology Act, 2009 and Legal Metrology (Packaged
Commodities) Rules, 2011 that require the prices of the goods to be rounded off to
the nearest fifty paisa. In support of his contention, he referred to the following table:
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 Original MRP Price 18% GST
Ideal revised MRP exclusive of MRP suggested by 28% GST Respondent 5 3.90625/-
0.703125/- 4.609375/- 4.5/-
4 3.125/- 0.5625/- 3.6874/- 3.5/-
3 2.34375/- 0.421875/- 2.765625/- 3/-
2 1.5625/- 0.28125/- 1.84375/- 2/-
22. Therefore, according to him, there is a legal impossibility in reducing the
Maximum Retail Price ('MRP'). As a result he stated that some of the companies had
passed on the commensurate benefit by way of increasing the grammage. He pointed
out that NAA vide order dated 24th December, 2018 passed in Ankit Kumar Bajoria
vs. M/s Hindustan Unilever Ltd., Case No.20/2018, had accepted the practice of
increasing grammage. However, this practice had not been accepted as a mode of
passing on commensurate benefit by NAA in subsequent orders.
23. Learned counsel for the petitioners pointed out that there is no provision of
appeal against the orders passed by NAA. They submitted that the absence of a
provision to appeal means that there is no judicial oversight over the decisions of
NAA and indicates that there is a presumption that the findings of NAA are infallible.
They submitted that Tribunals and Authorities which exercise functions similar to
NAA have a robust appellate mechanism. They submitted that lack of a provision to
appeal against the findings of NAA makes the Act, 2017 unconstitutional.
24. They submitted that Rule 124 of Rules, 2017 to the extent it deals with
appointment and terms and conditions of service of the Chairman and Members
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 of NAA is not in consonance
with Article 50 of the Constitution of India as there is scope for governmental
interference in the functioning of NAA.
25. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that NAA essentially determines
the rights of those complainants who filed complaints and determines liabilities of
the tax assessees against whom such an application/complaint is made / received.
Therefore, according to them, since the exercise of power by NAA is a quasi-judicial
function, the absence of a judicial member in the constitution of NAA renders Section
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
58
171 of the Act, 2017 and Rule 122 of the Rules, 2017 illegal and void. In support of
their submissions, they relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in Madras Bar
Association v. Union of India, (2015) 8 SCC 583, Madras Bar Association v. Union of
India, (2010) 11 SCC 1 and L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India, (1997) 3 SCC 261.
26. They further submitted that in case of equality of votes amongst the members of
NAA, the Chairperson has a second or casting vote, which renders Rule 134(2) illegal
and unconstitutional.
27. Learned counsel for the petitioner in W.P.(C) 12647/2018 stated that the report
issued by DGAP and the order passed by NAA in its case were barred by limitation as
provided under Rule 133 of the Rules, 2017. He submitted that Rule 133 uses the
word "shall" and thus mandates that NAA must determine and pass an order within a
period of three months (prior to amendment dated 28th June, 2019) from date of
receipt of the report from DGAP. He further submitted that the procedure that has
been prescribed under the Rule 129(6) ought to have been strictly followed by the
DGAP while investigating other products. He pointed out that in the case of the
petitioner in W.P.(C) 12647/2018, Rule 129(6) of the Rules, 2017 as on 25th
September, 2018 (the date on which NAA passed its order directing the DGAP to
conduct investigation on the amount allegedly profiteered W.P.(C) 7743/2019 &
other connected matters 18:24:48 by the petitioner) or 30th October, 2018 (the date
when the notice was issued by DGAP) mandatorily provided that DGAP was required
to complete its investigation within three months. However, the report was submitted
on 30th September, 2019 which is beyond the prescribed limitation period and thus,
the same was without jurisdiction. He submitted that at the time the proceedings
were initiated by NAA, Rule 129(6) of the Rules, 2017 mandated that the DGAP
"shall" submit its report to NAA within three months which could be further
extended to six months. Such time period was subsequently extended to six months
vide Notification No. 31/2019 dated 28th June, 2019 which could be further extended
to nine months. However, the impugned order is barred by limitation even if period
is taken as six months as applicable from 28th June, 2019.
28. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that under Rule 133(3) of the Rules, 2017, NAA
does not have any power or authority in law to pass an order in relation to any product, other than
the product against which complaint has been received by the authorities. They submitted that till
28th June, 2019 (when Rule 133(5) was enacted), NAA had no powers to direct investigation in
respect of any product, other than the product complained of. However, with effect from 28th June,
2019, Rule 133(5) was introduced, whereby for the first time, NAA was statutorily empowered in the
course of the proceedings before it, to direct the DGAP, to conduct an investigation in relation to
products, other than the product complained of. They submitted that as a result of the amendment,
the power to expand the scope of the investigation vests only with NAA and not with DGAP. They
pointed out that in many cases, DGAP had on its own expanded the scope of the investigation to
other products, which according to them, is without jurisdiction and ultra vires the provisions of the
Act, 2017 and Rules, 2017.

W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
29. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the levy of penalty and interest cannot be
ordered in the absence of corresponding specific substantive provisions under the Act, 2017. They
submitted that the consequences of the breach of Section 171 of Act, 2017 should have been provided
for in the first instance in the Act, 2017 itself and such wide and uncontrolled powers could not have
been conferred on NAA under Rules 127 and 133 of Rules, 2017. In support of their submission, they
relied upon the judgments of the Supreme Court in Indian Carbon Limited v. State of Assam (1997)
6 SCC 479 and Shree Bhagwati Steel Rolling Mills v. CCE 2015 (326) E.L.T. 209 (SC).
30. They stated that the petitioners have been issued show cause notices directing them to explain
why penalty prescribed under Section 171(3A) of the Act, 2017 read with Rule 133 (3) (d) of the
Rules, 2017 should not be imposed upon them. They, however, submitted that Section 171 (3A) has
been inserted in the Act, 2017 under Section 112 of the Finance Act, 2019 which came into force only
from 01st January, 2020 and so penalty under the aforesaid Section could not have been imposed
on the petitioners retrospectively.
31. Learned senior counsel for the petitioner in W.P.(C) 1171/2020 submitted that on a plain reading
of Section 171(1) with Section 2(108) of the Act, 2017, it is clear that it applies to a reduction in the
rate of Goods and Services Tax levied on a particular commodity or a grant of Input Tax Credit
under the Act, 2017. He stated that the term 'tax on any supply of goods or services' and Input Tax
Credit in Section 171 do not refer to any tax levied prior to 1st July, 2017 or to any Input Tax Credit
granted under any such prior statute. Therefore, according to him, Section 171(1) of the Act, 2017
does not contemplate a comparison of the taxes levied after the introduction of the Act, 2017 with a
basket of distinct indirect taxes applicable on goods and services before the operation of the Act. He
stated W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 that the indirect taxes levied on
goods and services prior to July, 2017 by the States such as the VAT/Sales-tax, Octroi duty and
Entry tax varied widely from State to State and often from area to area within a State. He stated that
as a result, it is impossible to make any meaningful comparison between the rates of the pre- Goods
and Services Tax taxes with the rates of tax levied under the Goods and Services Tax regime.
32. According to him, Section 171 of the Act, 2017 only permits a comparison between two single
rates and not a comparison between one single tax rate (Goods and Services Tax) and a basket or
combination of several other tax rates (pre-Goods and Services Tax indirect taxes). He submitted
that Sections 2(62) and 2(63) of the Act, 2017 make it clear that the benefit of Input Tax Credits
referred to in Section 171(1) are the Input Tax Credit granted under the Act, 2017 and not the Input
Tax Credits granted under the Central Excise Act, the Service- Tax statute or the Sales-tax Acts. He
further submitted that Section 9 of the Act, 2017 which provides for the levy of 'a tax called the
central goods and services tax on all intra-State supplies of goods or services or both...' uses the
same language as Section 171 and therefore Section 171 refers only to a reduction in the rate of tax
levied / referred to under Section 9 of the Act, 2017.
33. Learned senior counsel for the petitioners in W.P.(C) 2897/2021, submitted that in a contract
made after the reduction in the tax rate has come into effect, the parties are free to agree on any
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024

price. In support of his submission, he relied on Section 64-A of the Sale of Goods Act, which reads
as under:-
"64A. In contracts of sale, amount of increased or decreased taxes to be added or
deducted.--
(1) Unless a different intention appears from the terms of the contract, in the event of
any tax of the nature described in sub-section (2) being imposed, increased,
decreased or remitted in respect of any goods after the making of W.P.(C) 7743/2019
& other connected matters 18:24:48 any contract for the sale or purchase of such
goods without stipulation as to the payment of tax where tax was not chargeable at
the time of the making of the contract, or for the sale or purchase of such goods
tax-paid where tax was chargeable at that time,--
(a) if such imposition or increase so takes effect that the tax or increased tax, as the
case may be, or any part of such tax is paid or is payable, the seller may add so much
to the contract price as will be equivalent to the amount paid or payable in respect of
such tax or increase of tax, and he shall be entitled to be paid and to sue for and
recover such addition; and
(b) if such decrease or remission so takes effect that the decreased tax only, or no tax,
as the case may be, is paid or is payable, the buyer may deduct so much from the
contract price as will be equivalent to the decrease of tax or remitted tax, and he shall
not be liable to pay, or be sued for, or in respect of, such deduction.
(2) The provisions of sub-section (1) apply to the following taxes, namely:--
(a) any duty of customs or excise on goods;
(b) any tax on the sale or purchase of goods."
34. Learned counsel for the petitioner in W.P.(C) 2785/2021 submitted that as per Section 171(2)
read with Section 2(80) of the Act, 2017, the authority (empowered to examine whether there has
been commensurate reduction in price) has to be constituted by way of a duly gazetted notification
and as per Section 166 of the Act, 2017, such notification has to be laid before the Parliament. He
stated that contrary to these requirements, NAA had been constituted vide an administrative order
No.343/2017 dated 28th November, 2017. He stated that Rule 122 of the Rules, 2017 has been
notified and gazetted vide Notification No. 10/2017-Central Tax dated 28th June, 2017, which, at
first blush, suggests that NAA had been constituted thereunder. However, on a closer analysis, it is
clear that the said Rule cannot be said to be the fountainhead of constitution of NAA as Rule 122
essentially provides for composition of NAA and not for the constitution of NAA, even though the
heading of the Rule is couched to suggest that the same apparently constitutes NAA. He submitted
that if the said Rule W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 (which was notified on
28th June, 2017) was indeed the fountainhead of constitution of NAA, the same would go against

61
the very understanding of the respondents as recorded in the 35th and 45th Goods and Services Tax
Council Minutes of Meeting as well as the Memo dated 09th September, 2019 of the Department of
Revenue, Ministry of Finance, wherein it has been specifically observed that NAA had been
constituted vide an office order dated 28th November, 2017.
ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
35. Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondent-authorities,
prefaced his submissions by stating that Parliament introduced the Act, 2017 in order to simplify
and harmonise the indirect taxes regime in the country by eliminating the multiplicity of taxes that
were levied on the same supply system as a result of which there was a cascading effect.
36. According to him, the "anti-profiteering" measures were introduced in the Goods and Services
Tax regime in order to provide for a mechanism to ensure that the full benefits of input tax credits
and reduced Goods and Services Tax rates flow to the consumers who bear the burden of tax and to
prevent the suppliers from appropriating these benefits for themselves. He contended that
anti-profiteering provisions under the Act, 2017 and the Rules, 2017 have been brought into force in
the interest of consumer welfare and so any interpretation of the same must be in favour of the
consumer.
37. He stated that the provisions essentially create a substantive restriction on the suppliers from
appropriating the benefits of the Goods and Services Tax regime which may either be in the form of
reduction in the tax rate effected pursuant to a decision of the Goods and Services Tax Council or in
the form of W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 benefit of Input Tax Credit
which was unavailable under the earlier regime. He stated that correspondingly a substantive right
has been created in favour of consumers to receive the benefit of reduction in rates and benefit of
Input Tax Credit. He stated that in considering the constitutional vires of such a provision, the
larger public welfare intended to accrue from the provision ought to be taken into consideration. He
relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Ltd. vs.
Union of India, (2019) 8 SCC 416, wherein the Supreme Court examined a challenge to the
amendments to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. He stated that in the aforesaid case the
fact that the impugned provisions were part of a beneficial legislation was treated as an important
factor in order to uphold the provisions.
38. He further submitted that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 has been enacted in furtherance of the
goals of redistributive justice contained in the Directive Principles of State policy in Articles 38,
39(b) and 39(c) of the Constitution of India. The relevant portion of Articles 38, 39(b) and 39(c) are
reproduced hereinbelow:-
"Article 38 - State to secure a social order for the promotion of welfare of the people
(1) The State shall strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing and
protecting as effectively as it may a social order in which justice, social, economic and
political, shall inform all the institutions of the national life.

62
Article 39 - Certain principles of policy to be followed by the State The State shall, in particular,
direct its policy towards securing-- ...
(b) that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as
best to sub serve the common good;
(c) that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and
means of production to the common detriment;"
(emphasis supplied) W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
39. He submitted that the scope of judicial review in a fiscal statute is fairly limited as laid down by
the Supreme Court in multiple judgments such as State of M.P. v. Rakesh Kohli, (2012) 6 SCC 312
and R. K. Garg v. Union of India, 1981 (4) SCC 675.
40. He further submitted that Article 246A of the Constitution of India empowers the Legislature to
make laws 'with respect to' Goods and Services Tax. Article 246A of the Constitution reads as
under:-
"246A. Special provision with respect to goods and services tax.--
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in articles 246 and 254, Parliament, and,
subject to clause (2), the Legislature of every State, have power to make laws with
respect to goods and services tax imposed by the Union or by such State.
(2) Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to goods and services
tax where the supply of goods, or of services, or both takes place in the course of
inter-State trade or commerce.
Explanation.--The provisions of this article, shall, in respect of goods and services tax referred to in
clause (5) of article 279A, take effect from the date recommended by the Goods and Services Tax
Council."
41. He submitted that the impugned Section 171 of the Act, 2017 does not violate Article 246A of the
Constitution of India as the said Section is not a taxing provision but is only meant to ensure that
the sacrifice of tax revenue by the Central and State Governments for the welfare of the consumer is
passed on to them by the supplier.
42. He stated that the reduction of the tax burden and elimination of the cascading effect of taxes
were important objectives behind the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax and so the
impugned Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is very much a provision 'with respect to' Goods and Services
Tax and, therefore, Section 171 of the Act, 2017 falls well within the ambit of law-making powers of
the Parliament and the State legislatures. He further submitted that it is a well W.P.(C) 7743/2019 &
other connected matters 18:24:48 settled principle that in the field of taxation, the legislature enjoys
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
63
a greater latitude for classification as has been noted by the Supreme Court in various cases [See:
Steelworth Ltd. vs. State of Assam [1962] Supp (2) SCR 589]; Gopal Narain vs. State of U.P. [AIR
1964 SC 370]; Ganga Sugar Corp. Ltd. vs. State of U.P. [(1980) 1 SCC 223].
43. Countering the submissions of the Petitioners that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 suffers from the
vice of excessive delegation, Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel, submitted that no essential
legislative function has been delegated by the Legislature to NAA by way of Section 171 of the Act,
2017. He stated that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is very clear when it states that any reduction in the
rate of tax or the benefit of input tax credit has to be passed on to the recipient by way of
commensurate reduction in prices, that is to say that every person who is a recipient of goods or
services has to get the benefit. He further stated that it cannot be said that Section 171 of the Act,
2017 does not provide method and procedure for determining profiteering as it clearly stipulates
that 'any reduction' in the rate of tax on 'any supply of goods or services' or the benefit of input tax
credit shall be passed on to the recipient by way of 'commensurate reduction in prices'.
44. He emphatically denied that the word 'commensurate' as used in Section 171 of the Act, 2017 has
no clear and definite meaning. He referred to the Cambridge Dictionary where the word
'commensurate' is defined as 'in a correct and suitable amount compared to something else; suitable
in amount or quality compared to something else; matching in degree'. Thus, according to him,
Section 171 lays down a clear legislative policy and hence, no essential legislative function has been
delegated. He submitted that the Courts have consistently held that after laying down the broad
legislative policy, the minutiae can always be left W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters
18:24:48 to be decided by way of a subordinate legislation (See: Lohia Machines Ltd. vs. Union of
India, (1985) 2 SCC 197, Pt. Banarsi Das Bhanot vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, AIR 1958 SC 909, Sita
Ram Bishambher Dayal vs. State of U.P. (1972) 4 SCC 485). He further stated that it is well settled
that the question whether any particular legislation suffers from excessive delegation, has to be
determined by the Court having regard to the subject matter, the scheme, the provisions of the
statute including its preamble and the background on which the statute is enacted. In support of his
contentions, he relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Bhatnagars & Co. Ltd. vs. Union of
India, AIR 1957 SC 478 and Mohmedalli and Ors. vs. Union of India and Ors., AIR 1964 SC 980.
45. He further submitted that power of NAA to determine procedure and methodology flows from
Section 171 of the Act, 2017 itself which empowers the Authority to examine whether Input Tax
Credits availed by any registered person or the reduction in the tax rate on the goods or services had
actually resulted in commensurate reduction in the price of such goods or services. He stated that
the rule-making powers of the Central Government as prescribed in sub section (2) of Section 171 of
the Act, 2017 as well as Section 164 of the Act, 2017 empower the Central Government to prescribe
the powers and functions of the authority as well as to prescribe a Rule conferring the Authority with
the power to determine the methodology for determining whether the benefits of Goods and
Services Tax rate reductions and Input Tax Credits have been passed on. According to him, it is in
this background that the power to prescribe the powers and functions of NAA was delegated to the
Central Government by the Section. He, therefore, submitted that the principle delegatus non potest
delegare is not applicable to the present batch of matters.

64
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
46. He stated that Section 171(3) of the Act, 2017 duly provides that the Authority shall exercise such
powers and discharge such functions as may be prescribed. Accordingly, he stated that the Goods
and Services Tax Council which is a federal, constitutional body, comprising all the Finance
Ministers of all the States and UTs and the Union Finance Minister, in its due wisdom, and the
Central and the State Governments have framed Rules 127 and 133 which prescribe the functions
and powers of the Authority. He pointed out that these rules have been framed under the provisions
of Section 164 of the Act, 2017 which also has sanction of the Parliament and the State Legislatures.
Therefore, since the functions and powers to be exercised by the Authority have been approved by
competent legislatures, the same are legal and binding on the Petitioners. In support of his
submissions, he relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in M.K. Papiah vs. Excise Commr.
(1975) 1 SCC 492.
47. Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel stated that even if the petitioners' contention that no
methodology for calculating the profiteered amount had been prescribed is accepted, then also the
said Section will not be rendered unconstitutional because as per Rule 126 of the Rules, 2017, NAA
has been empowered to determine the said methodology. He pointed out that the Rule does not
stipulate that NAA must necessarily determine the methodology and procedure to compute
profiteering as it merely stipulates that the authority 'may' determine the methodology and
procedure for such computation. He stated that substantive provision of Section 171 of the Act, 2017
provides sufficient guidance to the NAA to determine the methodology on a case to case basis
depending on the peculiar facts of each case and the nature of the industry and its peculiarities.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
48. Additionally he stated that no uniform calculation method can be prescribed because the
computation of commensurate reduction in prices is purely a mathematical exercise and would vary
from SKU to SKU or unit to unit or service to service and hence for determining the quantum of
benefit as the extent of profiteering has to be arrived at on a case to case basis, by adopting suitable
method based on the nature and facts of each case. He further stated that NAA in exercise of the
powers conferred under Rule 126 of the Central Goods and Services Tax has notified the "National
Anti-Profiteering Authority:
Methodology and Procedure, 2018" dated 28th March, 2018 which contains the
methodology and procedure for determination as to whether the reduction in the rate
of tax on supply of goods or services or the benefit of Input Tax Credit has been
passed on by the registered person to the recipient by way of commensurate
reduction in prices.
49. In the context of the real estate sector, he stated that in cases where completion certificate had
not been issued prior to 01st July, 2017 and the supply of service by the developer continued past
01st July, 2017, the supplier got the benefit of Input Tax Credits under the Goods and Services Tax
regime. That being the case, there is no reason why a supplier ought not to be required to pass on
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
65
the benefit of Input Tax Credits under the Goods and Services Tax regime, with respect to the
remaining supply. According to him, a plain reading of Section 171 of the Act, 2017 would require
such developers to pass on the benefit of Input Tax Credits.
50. He stated that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 when it uses the term 'any supply' refers to each
taxable supply made to each recipient thereby clearly indicating that netting off of the benefit of tax
reduction by any supplier is not allowed. Hence, according to him, this benefit has to be calculated
for the SKU of W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 every product and has to be
passed on to every buyer of such SKU. These benefits, he stated cannot be passed on at the
entity/organization/branch/invoice/ product/business vertical level as they have to be passed on to
each and every buyer at each SKU/unit/service level by treating them equally. Additionally, he
stated that the language of the impugned provisions does not provide flexibility to adopt any other
mode for transferring benefit of reduction in tax rate and benefit of Input Tax Credit. He, thus,
stated that the Methodology & Procedure for passing on the benefits and for computation of the
profiteered amount has been duly prescribed in Section 171 of the Act, 2017 itself and hence, it is not
required to be prescribed separately.
51. He stated that in the case of reduction in the rate of tax, the quantum of benefit would depend
upon the pre reduction base price of the product which is required to be maintained during the post
rate reduction period on which the reduced rate of tax is required to be charged which would result
in reduction in the price. According to him, the new MRP is required to be declared by affixing
additional sticker or stamping or online printing in terms of letter No. WM/10(31)/2017 dated 16th
November, 2017 issued by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution,
Government of India.
52. While dealing with the argument of the Petitioners that it is legally impossible to pass on the
benefits of the reduction of rate of tax in cases of low priced products in the FMCG industry,
Mr.Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel, submitted that the Rules 2(m) and 6(1)(e) of Legal Metrology
(Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 (as amended from time to time) provide guidance to the
suppliers on how the MRP of the products is to be rounded off. The relevant portion of the aforesaid
Rules are reproduced as hereinunder:-
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 "Legal Metrology (Packaged

Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 as amended by the Legal Metrology

2. Definitions:-

                                        xxx                          xxx

words and figures shall be inserted, namely:- "shall clearly indicate that it is the
maximum retail price inclusive of all taxes and the price in rupees and paise be

53. He agreed with the contention of the petitioners that in some cases, commercial factors might
necessitate an increase in price despite reduction in rate W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 of tax or availability of benefit of Input Tax Credits. However, he stated that the
prices must not be increased to appropriate the benefit of the reduced tax rate or benefit of
additional Input Tax Credit that accrues to the Petitioners. According to him, if the supplier never
passed on the benefit of such reduced tax rate or Input Tax Credit by way of a commensurate
reduction in prices of the goods or services, by increasing the base price of such goods or services, he
would be depriving the recipients of the benefits of the reduction of tax rates or Input Tax Credits.
Hence, he stated that if the supplier when increasing the base prices of the goods or services does
not account for the (commensurate) reduction of prices as a result of the reduction of the tax rates
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
67
or benefit of the Input Tax Credits, the supplier would be said to be profiteering under Section 171 of
the Act, 2017. He, however, stated that NAA as well as this Court ought to be cautious of attempts of
entities to justify suspicious increase in base prices contemporaneous with the reduction in tax rates
or accruing of benefits of Input Tax Credits, under the garb of other commercial factors. According
to him, the Courts and implementing authorities must be vigilant about devices designed for
avoidance and must seek to adopt interpretations of the provisions that are least prone to resulting
in avoidance. He referred to the judgment in McDowell & Co. Ltd. v. CTO, (1985) 3 SCC 230 where it
has been held that "the proper way to construe a taxing statute, while considering a device to avoid
tax, is not to ask whether the provisions should be construed literally or liberally, nor whether the
transaction is not unreal and not prohibited by the statute, but whether the transaction is a device to
avoid tax, and whether the transaction is such that the judicial process may accord its approval to it"
and that "it is up to the Court to take stock to determine the nature of the new and sophisticated
legal devices to avoid tax and consider whether the situation created by the devices could be related
to the W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 existing legislation with the aid of
"emerging" techniques of interpretation." He submitted that although the aforesaid findings were
made in the context of tax avoidance, they would apply with equal force in the context of any
beneficial legislation.
54. Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel further stated that reference made by the petitioners to
guidelines under other laws and to certain foreign laws, is irrelevant to the issue of the
constitutional validity of Section 171 of the Act, 2017 as validity has to be determined on its own
merits.
55. He further stated that according to petitioners' own submissions the anti- profiteering provisions
introduced in Australia and Malaysia were essentially price control mechanisms as the legislation
enacted in Australia was aimed at prohibiting 'price exploitation' and the Act enacted in Malaysia
was aimed at prohibiting manufacturers from 'making unreasonably high profits'.
56. He stated that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is not a price-fixing provision as was sought to be
asserted by the Petitioners. He submitted that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 only concerns itself with
the indirect-tax component of the price of goods and services and does not impinge upon the
freedom of suppliers to fix prices of their goods and services keeping in view relevant commercial
and economic factors. He stated that the impugned section in pith and substance is a provision
pertaining to the Goods and Services Tax and through its enactment the Parliament sought to
ensure that the businesses pass on the benefits granted by the Government in term of reduction of
tax rate and availability of Input Tax Credit to the consumers and does not seek to interfere with the
right to trade by fixing the price at which the goods and services ought to be supplied. He pointed
out that the impugned provision applies irrespective of the price of the goods or services. He stated
that it cannot be said that a law which forbids recovery of W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 Goods and Services Tax at a rate higher than that applicable on the goods and
services and which forbids suppliers from recovering Input Taxes from the recipients where credits
are obtained on such Input Taxes, amounts to price- control or price-fixing.

57. He further submitted that even if Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is presumed to be a price-fixing
legislation, it would not render the Section violative of Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India.
He submitted that the Supreme Court in several cases such as Diwan General and Sugar Mills Pvt.
Ltd. & Ors. vs. Union of India, AIR (1959) SC 626; Union of India vs. Cynamide India Ltd., (1987) 2
SCC 720 where price fixing orders had been challenged, had upheld such orders by examining
whether the orders take into account relevant factors/considerations.
58. He submitted that there is no legal principle on the basis of which the petitioners can contend
that the mere absence of a time period, up to which reduced prices are required to be maintained,
would render the provision unconstitutional.
59. He submitted that recently, a three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Madras Bar
Association v. Union of India & Anr., (2021) SCC OnLine SC 463, while considering the challenge to
the vires of Tribunal Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2021 and
Sections 184 and 186(2) of the Finance Act, 2017 as amended by the Tribunal Reforms
(Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2021, held that "the apprehensions of misuse
of a statutory provision is not a ground to declare the provisions of a statute as void."
60. Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel, submitted that for an appeal to be maintainable, it must
have its genesis in the authority of law [See: M. Ramnarain W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 (P) Ltd. v. State Trading Corpn. of India Ltd. [(1983) 3 SCC 75 and Gujarat Agro
Industries Co. Ltd. v. Municipal Corpn. of the City of Ahmedabad (1999) 4 SCC 468]. He submitted
that the principle of "appeal being a statutory right and no party having a right to file appeal except
in accordance with the prescribed procedure" is now well settled as held by the Supreme Court in
CCI v. SAIL, (2010) 10 SCC 744. According to him, the right to appeal is not a right which can be
assumed by logical analysis much less by exercise of inherent jurisdiction. It essentially should be
provided by the law in force. In the absence of any specific provision creating a right in a party to file
an appeal, such right can neither be assumed nor inferred in favour of the party.
61. He stated that Section 171(2) of the Act, 2017 lays down the role of NAA which is to examine
whether Input Tax Credit availed by any registered person and/or the reduction in tax rates have
actually resulted in a commensurate reduction in the price of goods or services supplied by him and
the duties of NAA have been further elaborated upon in Rule 127 of the Rules, 2017. He further
stated that from a perusal of the aforesaid provision, it is clear that the functions of NAA are in the
nature of a fact-finding exercise. He submitted that even if it is assumed that the Authority
undertakes an exercise which determines the rights and liabilities of registered persons under the
Act, the contention of the Petitioners that the absence of a judicial member in NAA renders the
authority unconstitutional is not tenable as there is no universal principle that every quasi- judicial
authority at every level must have a judicial member. According to him, such a requirement would
not only be wholly impractical but also be legally suspect. He stated that the judgments which have
been relied upon by the petitioners follow a uniform principle that whenever a judicial tribunal is
intended to replace or supplant the High Court with respect to judicial power which was W.P.(C)
7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 hitherto vested in or exercised by Courts, such
Tribunals must be manned by judicial members in addition to technical members who have
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
69
specialized knowledge or expertise in a given field. In support of his submissions, he relied on the
judgments of the Supreme Court in Union of India vs. R. Gandhi, (2010) 11 SCC 1, Rojer Mathews
vs. South Indian Bank, (2019) SCC OnLine SC 1456. He stated: (a) the NAA did not replace or
substitute any function which Courts were exercising hitherto; (b) it performs quasi-judicial
functions but cannot be equated with a judicial tribunal; (c) it performs its functions in a fair and
reasonable manner in accordance with the Act but does not have the trappings of a Court and (d)
absence of a judicial member does not render the constitution of the NAA unconstitutional or legally
invalid.
62. He further stated that there are several statutory bodies that exercise quasi- judicial functions,
but are not required to have judicial members. For example, Section 4(1) of the Securities and
Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 which provides for the composition of the Securities and
Exchange Board of India ('SEBI'), does not necessarily require the presence of Judicial Members in
SEBI. He pointed out that the fact that the SEBI inter-alia performs judicial functions has been
recognized by the Supreme Court in Clariant International Ltd. & Anr. vs. Securities and Exchange
Board of India (2004) 8 SCC 524. Similarly, he stated that Telecom Regulatory Authority of India,
Medical Council of India, Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the Assessing Officers,
CIT (Appeals), Dispute Resolution Panel under the Income Tax Act perform quasi- judicial
functions but there is no requirement that such members must possess either a law degree or have
had judicial experience.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
63. He submitted that a casting vote in the hands of the chairperson is a fair and reasonable manner
of deciding a tie in votes and is commonly provided for in several laws.
64. He stated that NAA has been constituted as per the provisions of Rule 122 of the Rules, 2017.
The Rules, 2017, including Rule 122, have been duly notified by the Ministry of Finance, Department
of Revenue, Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs vide Notification No. 3/2017- Central Tax
dated 19th June, 2017 and published in the Gazette of India- Extraordinary vide G.S.R. No. 610(E)
on the same date and hence NAA has been duly constituted by a Notification as required under
Section 171(2) of the Act, 2017. The above notification dated 19th June, 2017 was laid before the Lok
Sabha on 11th August, 2017 and before the Rajya Sabha on 08th August, 2017 as required by Section
166 of the Act, 2017.
65. He submitted that in the absence of an express provision to the effect that anti-profiteering
proceedings would abate if time-lines are not strictly adhered to, and if the time-lines are read to be
mandatory, it would result in gross injustice to the consumers who would be left remediless on
account of no fault of theirs.
66. Further, in the absence of anything to the contrary in the amendment or the amended provision,
on a plain reading of the provision, the amended/extended time-period for passing of an order
would apply to all pending and future proceedings before NAA. He submitted that the time-frames
provided in the anti- profiteering provisions are merely directory in nature and not mandatory.

67. Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel, stated that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is widely worded
and does not limit the scope of examination to only the goods and services in respect of which a
complaint is received by the authorities. He submitted that Rule 129 of the Rules, 2017, which
provides for the scope of W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 powers of the
DGAP, uses the words 'any supply of goods or services' and so the scope of powers of DGAP is very
wide.
68. He stated that the contention of the petitioners that there was no mechanism for recovery of the
alleged profiteered amount under Section 171 of the Act, 2017 overlooks Rule 133(3)(b) of the Rules,
2017 prescribed under Section 171(3) of the Act, 2017 which empowers NAA to order a supplier to
return to the recipient, an amount equivalent to the amount not passed on by way of commensurate
reduction in prices along with interest at the rate of eighteen per cent [18%] from the date of
collection of the higher amount till the date of the return of such amount or recovery of the amount
not returned including interest, as the case may be.
69. Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel, submitted that the judgments of Supreme Court in Indian
Carbon Ltd. Vs. State of Assam, (1997) 6 SCC 479 and Shree Bhagwati Steel Rolling Mills vs. CCE
(2016) 3 SCC 643 etc. relied upon by the petitioners were delivered in the context of considering the
question of whether interest can be levied for delayed payment of tax and whether penalty can be
imposed for non-payment of tax under a Rule where the Statute does not authorize the same.
70. He submitted that by virtue of Rule 133(3)(d) of the Rules, 2017, NAA was already vested with
the powers to impose penalties even before Section 171(3A) came into force. According to him,
Section 171(3A) of the Act, 2017 is therefore merely clarificatory in nature. He further submitted that
in the absence of a power to impose penalties, there would be no consequence arising out of the
violation of Section 171(1) of the Act, 2017 by suppliers and consequently, there would be no
deterrence against non-compliance.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
71. Even otherwise, he stated that show cause notices initiating penalty proceedings in relation to
violation of Section 171(1) prior to the coming into force of Section 171(3A) of the Act, 2017, have
been withdrawn by NAA and penalty proceedings in all such cases are not being pressed and so this
issue has become infructuous. Insofar as the objection regarding levy of interest is concerned, he
submitted that the object of the anti-profiteering measures provided in Section 171 of the Act, 2017
is to ensure that the Input Tax Credits availed by any registered person or the reduction in tax rate
result in a commensurate reduction in the price of goods or services or both supplied by him and as
a result, the benefit of the same passed on to the recipients. He stated that the profiteered amount
includes the benefit of reduction in taxes or Input Tax Credits which was required to be passed on by
way of reduction in prices as well as the tax thereon which the consumer is forced to pay as a result
of the non-reduction of prices as required under Section 171(1) of the Act, 2017. He emphasised that
had the supplier passed on the benefit of reduction in tax rates or Input Tax Credit by way of
reduction in prices, the consumer would not have been required to pay the additional Goods and
Services Tax.

72. Mr. Zoheb Hossain submitted that without prejudice to the fact that each and every Act of NAA
is well reasoned and justified and can be defended to the satisfaction of this Court as and when the
same are taken up case-wise, the case- specific submissions of the petitioners have no bearing
whatsoever while considering the constitutional vires of Section 171 of the Act, 2017 and Rules
contained in Chapter XV of the Rules, 2017.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE
LEARNED AMICUS CURIAE
73. Mr. Amar Dave, learned Amicus Curiae stated that the cardinal objective with which the Goods
and Services Tax had been introduced was inter alia to ensure an efficient and robust indirect taxing
system.
74. He contended that a perusal of the reports and the discussions preceding the introduction of
Goods and Services Tax regime clearly indicated that the impact on prices of various goods and
services had been factored in as a necessary consequence of the shift over to the Goods and Services
Tax regime.
75. He pointed out that the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India ('CAG') of June,
2010 dealt with the manner in which the Value Added Tax ('VAT') was implemented in India and
accordingly threw light on the lessons for transition to Goods and Services Tax. One of the elements
covered in the said report was the impact that VAT had on prices of goods. The report found that the
white paper at the time of introduction of VAT was sanguine that implementation of VAT would
bring down the prices of goods due to rationalisation of tax rates and abolition of cascading effect of
tax in the legacy systems. However, on the examination and analysis of a small data survey, the CAG
found that the manufacturers did not reduce the maximum retail prices after introduction of VAT
even when there had been a substantial reduction in tax rates. It was, therefore, found that despite
introduction of VAT and reduction in the tax rates, the benefits ensuing from such reduction were
not passed on to the consumers by the manufacturers and the dealer networks across the VAT chain
had enriched themselves at the cost of the common man. The report highlighted these aspects as
those to be borne in mind at the time of considering the shift over to the Goods and Services Tax
regime and to ensure mechanism for the purposes W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters
18:24:48 of passing on the benefit of tax rationalisation to the ultimate common man.
76. He stated that similarly, another report of the taskforce on Goods and Services Tax i.e. the 13th
Finance Commission Report of 15th December, 2009 comprehensively dealt with minute aspects of
the contemplated Goods and Services Tax ecosystem and various elements of such switchover. In its
introduction, the report contemplated inter alia that the prevailing indirect tax system both at the
Central and the State level included high import tariffs, excise duties and turnover tax on domestic
goods and services having cascading effects, leading to a distorted structure of production,
consumption and exports and this problem could be effectively addressed by shifting the tax burden
from production and trade to final consumption. The report highlighted the implications of the
switchover to Goods and Services Tax and the benefits that would entail from such a switchover. He
pointed out that para 7.22 of the said report specifically recorded that the benefit to the poor from
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
72
the implementation of Goods and Services Tax would flow from two sources, first through increase
in the income levels and second through reduction in prices of goods consumed by them. It was
specifically observed that the proposed switchover to the flawless Goods and Services Tax system
should therefore be viewed as a pro-poor system and not regressive. The report further specifically
went into the implications of the proposed switchover to Goods and Services Tax on various
products and sectors including prices of the goods.
77. He further stated that the Report of the Select Committee (presented to the Rajya Sabha on 22nd
July, 2015) dealt with the issues of transition to Goods and Services Tax and the same dealt with
inter alia issues of consumer benefit that would arise on account of the transition and related
aspects.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
78. Learned Amicus Curiae contended that the discussions at the time of the introduction of the
Goods and Services Tax Bill in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha with regard to Section 171 of the
Act, 2017 left no room for doubt that the said measure was introduced as a consumer benefit
measure in order to ensure that the past experiences of the stakeholders retaining the benefit of tax
reductions due to lack of legal mechanism is not repeated at the time of the switchover to Goods and
Services Tax regime.
79. He submitted that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is a stand-alone provision and provides for all the
parameters which act as navigational tools while applying the said provision. He submitted that the
pre-requisites for triggering the provision are specifically provided therein and the consequence of
the section is also specifically provided for. He submitted that the beneficiary of the contemplated
benefit provided under the provision is clearly specified, and therefore, all critical aspects of its
applicability and workability stand embedded in the section itself.
80. Learned Amicus Curiae stated that by its very nature, Section 171 of the Act, 2017 provides for an
inherent assumption that the reduction of tax rate or the benefit of Input Tax Credit under the
Goods and Services Tax mechanism specifically requires, as a consequence thereof, a commensurate
reduction in price. He stated that the contention that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 amounts to price
regulation is not correct as the provision has been inserted to ensure specifically that the
consequential effect of the tax rate must enure to the benefit of the consumer. The very foundation
of the same is based on the concept that when the tax rate undergoes a reduction under the Goods
and Services Tax regime, it obviously must translate into price reduction. He submitted that if there
is a variation (which can be justified by the supplier) of other factors such as any W.P.(C) 7743/2019
& other connected matters 18:24:48 costs necessitating the setting off of such reduction of price, the
inherent presumption is a rebuttable presumption.
81. He submitted that the concept of Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is based on consumer welfare and
equity. He contended that it is also the spirit of the constitutional provisions that no entity can be
permitted to collect any tax (in any direct or indirect manner or by any implicit representation to
that effect) except by the authority of law. Hence, when in spite of the reduction in the applicable tax
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
73
rate, consequential reduction of the actual price does not take place and the amount is retained by
the supplier, it would qualify as an unjust enrichment at the cost of the recipient who is the
otherwise beneficiary of the reduction of the tax rate.
82. He stated that any indirect manner of passing on the benefit like 'Diwali Dhamaka' or
cross-subsidisation would be interfering with the right of the recipient to get the direct benefit.
According to him, such an indirect method to pass the benefit is not contemplated under the express
provisions and is also not in sync with the right of the recipient to get the actual benefit of the
change in the tax rate. He stated that no such indirect method to pass on the benefit can be
read-into the provision when the same is consciously not provided for therein thereby
establishing/cementing the right of the recipient/consumer to get the benefit by way of
commensurate reduction of the price itself.
83. Learned Amicus Curiae submitted that under the scheme of the Act, 2017, it is contemplated
that the Central Government on the recommendations of the Goods and Services Tax Council (a
constitutional body formed under the provisions of Article 279A of the Constitution of India) may
constitute an Authority or empower an existing Authority constituted under any law for the purpose
of examining whether benefit has actually been passed on to the W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other
connected matters 18:24:48 recipients as contemplated under Section 171 of the Act, 2017. He
pointed out that Chapter XV of the Rules deals with the subject of anti-profiteering and inter- alia
provides the different layers of fact-finding examination that have to be undertaken with respect to
the actual passing of benefit contemplated under Section 171 of the Act, 2017. According to him, it is
clear from the said Rules that the same contemplates constitution of Standing Committee and
Screening Committee at different levels. Further, under the scheme of the Rules, it is provided that
the Standing Committee shall within a stipulated time frame after following the process prescribed
therein determine whether there is any prima facie evidence to support the claim of the applicant
that the benefit of reduction in the rate of tax or the benefit of Input Tax Credit or the benefit of
Input Tax Credit has, in fact, not been passed on to the recipient. He stated that the scheme of the
Rules therefore contemplates that such application(s) from the interested parties shall be first
examined by the State level Screening Committee if they pertain to issues local in nature and
subsequently be forwarded to the Standing Committee for action. Further, when the Standing
Committee reaches a prima facie conclusion, it shall refer the matter to the DGAP for a detailed
investigation. Rule 129 of the Rules, 2017 provides for a comprehensive mechanism which the
DGAP is required to follow once the matter is forwarded to it. Once the report of the DGAP is
forwarded to the Authority, the Rules provide for the mechanism in which the Authority is to
undertake the exercise of further considerations and reaching its final conclusions. Thus, according
to him, the perusal of the said Scheme under the Rules, 2017 therefore clearly establishes a
fact-finding mechanism at different levels culminating in the final determination of the matter by
the Authority.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
84. He submitted that in view of the purely fact-based nature of the exercise and the different levels
contemplated for such findings under the Rules the contention that there is lack of appropriate
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
74
redressal measures under the Scheme of Anti-Profiteering measures in the Goods and Services Tax
framework is clearly negated.
85. Learned Amicus Curiae submitted that there is no question of any unbridled powers being
conferred on the authority which is entrusted with the obligation of ensuring the compliance of the
said provision as enough guidance emanates from the parent provision itself. He contended that all
the factors such as the nature of the exercise to be carried out; the objective sought to be achieved by
the said exercise; the incorporation of all critical elements which are to guide any such exercise in
the section itself; the nature of the authority contemplated and tasked to carry out the functions; the
period monitoring of the same by the Goods and Services Tax Council etc. are to be considered when
dealing with the subject matter.
COURT'S REASONING PRINCIPLES FOR ADJUDICATING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF AN
ENACTMENT
86. This Court is of the view that the principles for adjudicating the constitutionality of an
enactment are well settled. Though they have been succinctly set out in a number of judgments, yet
this Court considers it appropriate to reiterate them.
87. A Statute can be declared as unconstitutional only if the Petitioners make out a case that the
Legislature did not have the legislative competence to pass such a Statute or that the provisions of
the Statute violate the Fundamental Rights W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
guaranteed under Part-III of the Constitution of India or that the Legislature concerned has
abdicated its essential legislative function or that the impugned provision is arbitrary, unreasonable
or vague in any manner. D.D. Basu in Shorter Constitution of India (16th Edn., 2021) has
enumerated the grounds on which a law may be declared to be unconstitutional as follows:-
(i) Contravention of any fundamental right, specified in Part III of the Constitution.
(ii) Legislating on a subject which is not assigned to the relevant legislature by the
distribution of powers made by the Seventh Schedule, read with the connected
articles.
(iii) Contravention of any of the mandatory provisions of the Constitution which
impose limitations upon the powers of a legislature e.g. Article 301.
(iv) In the case of a State law, it will be invalid insofar as it seeks to operate beyond
the boundaries of the State.
(v) That the legislature concerned has abdicated its essential legislative function as
assigned to it by the Constitution or has made an excessive delegation of that power
to some other body.
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
75
88. It must also be kept in mind that there is always a presumption in favour of constitutionality of
an enactment and the burden to show that there has been a clear transgression of constitutional
principles is upon the person who attacks such an enactment. Whenever constitutionality of a
provision is challenged on the ground that it infringes a fundamental right, the direct and inevitable
effect/consequence of the legislation has to be taken into account. The Supreme Court in Namit
Sharma vs. Union of India, (2013) 1 SCC 745 has held as under:-
"20. Dealing with the matter of closure of slaughterhouses in Hinsa Virodhak Sangh
v. Mirzapur Moti Kuresh Jamat [(2008) 5 SCC 33] , the Court while noticing its
earlier judgment Govt. of A.P. v. P. Laxmi Devi [(2008) 4 SCC 720] , introduced a
rule for exercise of such jurisdiction by the courts stating that the court should
exercise judicial restraint while judging the constitutional validity of the statute or
even that of a delegated legislation and it is only when there is clear violation of a
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 constitutional provision
beyond reasonable doubt that the court should declare a provision to be
unconstitutional....."
(emphasis supplied) COURTS' APPROACH WHILE DEALING WITH TAX OR ECONOMIC LAWS
89. Further, the Courts have consistently held that the laws relating to economic activities have to be
viewed with greater latitude than laws touching civil rights and that the Legislature has to be
allowed some play in the joints because it has to deal with complex problems. The Supreme Court in
its recent judgment in Union of India vs. VKC Footsteps India (P) Ltd., 2021 SCC OnLine SC 706 has
reiterated the approach that the Courts have to adopt while dealing with tax or economic
regulations. The relevant portion of the said judgment is reproduced hereinbelow:-
"135. While we are alive to the anomalies of the formula, an anomaly per se cannot
result in the invalidation of a fiscal rule which has been framed in exercise of the
power of delegated legislation. In R.K. Garg [R.K. Garg v. Union of India, (1981) 4
SCC 675 : 1982 SCC (Tax) 30] , P.N. Bhagwati, J. (as the learned Chief Justice then
was) speaking for the Constitution Bench underscored the importance of the
rationale for viewing laws relating to economic activities with greater latitude than
laws touching civil rights. The Court held : (SCC pp. 690- 91, para 8) "8. Another rule
of equal importance is that laws relating to economic activities should be viewed with
greater latitude than laws touching civil rights such as freedom of speech, religion,
etc. It has been said by no less a person than Holmes, J., that the legislature should
be allowed some play in the joints, because it has to deal with complex problems
which do not admit of solution through any doctrinaire or straitjacket formula and
this is particularly true in case of legislation dealing with economic matters, where,
having regard to the nature of the problems required to be dealt with, greater play in
the joints has to be allowed to the legislature. The court should feel more inclined to
give judicial deference to legislative judgment in the field of economic regulation than
in other areas where fundamental human rights are involved. Nowhere has this
admonition been more felicitously expressed than in Morey v. Doud [Morey v. Doud,
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
76
1957 SCC OnLine US SC 105 : 1 L Ed 2d 1485 : 354 US 457 (1957)] where Frankfurter,
J., said in his inimitable style:
In the utilities, tax and economic regulation cases, there are good reasons for judicial
self-restraint if not judicial deference to legislative judgment. The legislature after all
has the affirmative responsibility. The courts have only the power to destroy, not to
reconstruct. When these are added to the complexity of economic regulation, W.P.(C)
7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 the uncertainty, the liability to error,
the bewildering conflict of the experts, and the number of times the Judges have been
overruled by events -- self-limitation can be seen to be the path to judicial wisdom
and institutional prestige and stability. The Court must always remember that
'legislation is directed to practical problems, that the economic mechanism is highly
sensitive and complex, that many problems are singular and contingent, that laws are
not abstract propositions and do not relate to abstract units and are not to be
measured by abstract symmetry'; 'that exact wisdom and nice adaption of remedy are
not always possible' and that 'judgment is largely a prophecy based on meagre and
uninterpreted experience'. Every legislation particularly in economic matters is
essentially empiric and it is based on experimentation or what one may call trial and
error method and therefore it cannot provide for all possible situations or anticipate
all possible abuses. There may be crudities and inequities in complicated
experimental economic legislation but on that account alone it cannot be struck down
as invalid. The courts cannot, as pointed out by the United States Supreme Court in
Secy. of Agriculture v. Central Roig Refining Co. [Secy. of Agriculture v. Central Roig
Refining Co., 1950 SCC OnLine US SC 14 : 94 L Ed 381 : 338 US 604 (1950)] be
converted into tribunals for relief from such crudities and inequities. There may even
be possibilities of abuse, but that too cannot of itself be a ground for invalidating the
legislation, because it is not possible for any legislature to anticipate as if by some
divine prescience, distortions and abuses of its legislation which may be made by
those subject to its provisions and to provide against such distortions and abuses.
Indeed, howsoever great may be the care bestowed on its framing, it is difficult to
conceive of a legislation which is not capable of being abused by perverted human
ingenuity. The Court must therefore adjudge the constitutionality of such legislation
by the generality of its provisions and not by its crudities or inequities or by the
possibilities of abuse of any of its provisions. If any crudities, inequities or
possibilities of abuse come to light, the legislature can always step in and enact
suitable amendatory legislation. That is the essence of pragmatic approach which
must guide and inspire the legislature in dealing with complex economic issues.""
(emphasis supplied) ACT, 2017 MARKS A PARADIGM SHIFT IN THE FIELD OF INDIRECT
TAXES
90. This Court is of the view that the Act, 2017 not only simplifies and harmonises the indirect tax
regime in the country, but it also marks a paradigm shift in the manner in which they are enacted,
levied and collected in India.
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
77
91. The Act, 2017 primarily intends to provide a common national market for Goods and Services as
reflected in its moto 'One Nation One Tax'. It is a consumer-centric Act, as it eliminates the levy of
multiple taxes, avoids any cascading tax effect, streamlines the credit mechanism by weeding out
distortions W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 in the supply chains and
ensures a smooth pass-through and transparent mechanism for levying tax. This is apparent from
the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act, 2017. The same is reproduced hereinbelow:-
"Presently, the Central Government levies tax on, manufacture of certain goods in the
form of Central Excise duty, provision of certain services in the form of service tax,
inter-State sale of goods in the form of Central Sales tax. Similarly, the State
Governments levy tax on and on retail sales in the form of value added tax, entry of
goods in the State in the form of entry tax, luxury tax and purchase tax, etc.
Accordingly, there is multiplicity of taxes which are being levied on the same supply
chain.
2. The present tax system on goods and services is facing certain difficulties as
under--
(i) there is cascading of taxes as taxes levied by the Central Government are not
available as set off against the taxes being levied by the State Governments;
(ii) certain taxes levied by State Governments are not allowed as set off for payment
of other taxes being levied by them;
(iii) the variety of Value Added Tax Laws in the country with disparate tax rates and
dissimilar tax practices divides the country into separate economic spheres; and
(iv) the creation of tariff and non-tariff barriers such as octroi, entry tax, check posts,
etc., hinder the free flow of trade throughout the country. Besides that, the large
number of taxes create high compliance cost for the taxpayers in the form of number
of returns, payments, etc.
3. In view of the aforesaid difficulties, all the above mentioned taxes are proposed to
be subsumed in a single tax called the goods and services tax which will be levied on
supply of goods or services or both at each stage of supply chain starting from
manufacture or import and till the last retail level. So, any tax that is presently being
levied by the Central Government or the State Governments on the supply of goods or
services is going to be converged in goods and services tax which is proposed to be a
dual levy where the Central Government will levy and collect tax in the form of
central goods and services tax and the State Government will levy and collect tax in
the form of state goods and services tax on intra-State supply of goods or services or
both.

4. In view of the above, it has become necessary to have a Central legislation, namely
the Central Goods and Services Tax Bill, 2017. The proposed legislation will confer
power upon the Central Government for levying goods and services tax on the supply
of goods or services or both which takes place within a State. The proposed legislation
will simplify and harmonise the indirect tax regime in the country. It is expected to
reduce cost of production and inflation in the economy, thereby making the Indian
trade and industry more competitive, domestically as well as internationally. Due to
the seamless transfer of input tax credit from one W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other
connected matters 18:24:48 stage to another in the chain of value addition, there is
an in-built mechanism in the design of goods and services tax that would incentivise
tax compliance by taxpayers. The proposed goods and services tax will broaden the
tax base, and result in better tax compliance due to a robust information technology
infrastructure.
5. The Central Goods and Services Tax Bill, 2017, inter alia, provides for the
following, namely:--
(a) to levy tax on all intra-State supplies of goods or services or both except supply of
alcoholic liquor for human consumption at a rate to be notified, not exceeding twenty
per cent. as recommended by the Goods and Services Tax Council (the Council);
(b) to broad base the input tax credit by making it available in respect of taxes paid
on any supply of goods or services or both used or intended to be used in the course
or furtherance of business;
(c) to impose obligation on electronic commerce operators to collect tax at source, at
such rate not exceeding one per cent. of net value of taxable supplies, out of payments
to suppliers supplying goods or services through their portals;
(d) to provide for self-assessment of the taxes payable by the registered person;
(e) to provide for conduct of audit of registered persons in order to verify compliance
with the provisions of the Act;
(f) to provide for recovery of arrears of tax using various modes including detaining
and sale of goods, movable and immovable property of defaulting taxable person;
(g) to provide for powers of inspection, search, seizure and arrest to the officers;
(h) to establish the Goods and Services Tax Appellate Tribunal by the Central
Government for hearing appeals against the orders passed by the Appellate Authority
or the Revisional Authority;
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
79
(i) to make provision for penalties for contravention of the provisions of the proposed
Legislation;
(j) to provide for an anti-profiteering clause in order to ensure that business passes
on the benefit of reduced tax incidence on goods or services or both to the
consumers; and
(k) to provide for elaborate transitional provisions for smooth transition of existing
taxpayers to goods and services tax regime.
6. The Notes on clauses explain in detail the various provisions contained in the Central Goods and
Services Tax Bill, 2017.
7. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives."
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
92. From the aforesaid, it is apparent that the Act, 2017 levies a single tax on the supply of goods or
services on the value addition at each stage of the supply chain from purchase of raw materials,
manufacture of product or import, till the finished good reaches the hands of the consumer. This is
best illustrated by the following example:-
Stages Actions Price+Tax=cost Cost/ Total Tax@10% Total Addition only on price
addition st 1 Purchase of raw - 2000 2000 200 2200 material by manufacturer 2nd
Sold finished goods to 2000+200=2200 500 2700 50 2750 wholesaler (raw material

by Trader 4th Purchase of finished 3150+40=3190 300 3490 30 3520 goods by actual
consumer Total 3200 320 3520
93. The Goods and Service Tax is a destination-based tax and is levied at the point of consumption.
Accordingly, the taxes get accumulated with the original price and due to the effect of Input Tax
Credit, the cascading effect i.e. tax on tax is removed. This is best illustrated by the following
example:-
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 OLD SYSTEM GOODS AND
SERVICES TAX SYSTEM MANUFACTURING COST OF CAR MANUFACTURING
COST OF CAR 250,000 250,000 ADD: PROFIT @20% 50,000 ADD: PROFIT @20%

94. Consequently, the intent of the Act, 2017 is to provide a common national market, boost
productivity, increase competitiveness, broaden the tax base and make India a manufacturing hub.

SECTION 171 MANDATES THAT TAX FOREGONE HAS TO BE PASSED ON AS A
COMMENSURATE REDUCTION IN PRICE.
95. As rightly pointed out by the learned Amicus Curiae, the introduction of the system of Goods and
Services Tax was preceded by a comprehensive examination of the subject by different committees
and the reports of such committees had been factored in while finalizing the framework of the
Goods and Services Tax.
96. An area of concern identified in the said reports was that though with the doing away of
multiplicity and cascading of taxes, the prices of goods and services would come down, yet would
this benefit, if any, be passed on to the consumer by the manufacturers and sellers. To ensure that
the benefit is passed on, an anti-profiteering provision in the form of Section 171 of the Act, 2017,
was introduced.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
97. Section 171 of the Act, 2017 mandates that the suppliers shall pass on the benefit of reduction of
the rate of Goods and Services Tax or Input Tax Credits by way of commensurate reduction in prices
to the recipient. Section 171 deals with amounts that the Central and State Governments have
foregone from the public exchequer in favour of the consumers. This Court is of the view that the
amounts foregone from the public exchequer in favour of the consumers cannot be appropriated by
the manufacturers, traders, distributors etc. To allow them to do so would amount to unjust
enrichment. Consequently, when the Goods and Services Tax rate gets reduced or the benefit of
input tax credit, becomes available as a necessary consequence the final price paid by the recipient
obviously requires to be reduced. In the absence of such anti-profiteering provisions, there would be
no legal obligation to pass on the benefit of the Goods and Services Tax regime and, consequently,
the intended objective of reducing overall tax rates and mitigating the cascading effect would not be
achieved.
98. The expression 'profiteered' has been defined in the Explanation to Section 171 of the Act, 2017
to mean 'the amount determined on account of not passing the benefit of reduction in rate of tax on
supply of goods or services or both or the benefit of input tax credit to the recipient by way of
commensurate reduction in the price of the goods or services or both'. According to Collins English
Dictionary - Complete and Unabridged, 12th Edition 2014, the word 'commensurate' means "1.
having the same extent or duration; 2. corresponding in degree, amount, or size; proportionate; 3.
able to be measured by a common standard; commensurable." The word 'commensurate' has been
used in several judgments of the Supreme Court for laying down yardsticks in different contexts,
from determining the rightfulness of the posting of a public servant, to assessing the correctness of
criminal sentencing and calculating maintenance amounts W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 indicating that the Courts too have a clear and definite understanding of this word.
[See: P.K. Chinnasamy v. Govt. of T.N., (1987) 4 SCC 601; Centre for PIL v. Housing & Urban
Development Corpn. Ltd., (2017) 3 SCC 605; Dinesh v. State of Rajasthan, (2006) 3 SCC 771; Vimala
(K.) v. Veeraswamy (K.), (1991) 2 SCC 375].
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024

81
99. The obligation of effecting/making a "commensurate" reduction in prices, as mentioned
hereinabove, is relevant to the underlying objective of the Goods and Services Tax regime which is to
ensure that suppliers pass on the benefits of reduction in the rate of tax and Input Tax Credit to the
consumers, especially since the Goods and Services Tax is a consumption-based tax (as adopted in
India) and the recipient (consumer) practically pays the taxes which are included in the final price.
Section 171 of the Act, 2017, therefore, is not to be looked at as a price control measure but is to be
seen to be directly connected with the objectives of the Goods and Services Tax regime.
Consequently, the word 'commensurate' in Section 171 of the Act, 2017 means that whatever actual
saving arises due to the reduction in rates of tax or the benefit of the Input Tax Credit, in rupee and
paisa terms, must be reflected as equal or near about reduction in price . In other words, tax
foregone by the authorities has to be passed on to the consumer as commensurate reduction in
price.
100. Accordingly, Section 171 of the Act, 2017 has been enacted, in public interest, with the
consumer welfare objective of ensuring that suppliers pass on the benefit of Input Tax Credits and
reduction of rate of Goods and Services Tax to the consumers. The Section does this by firstly
creating a substantive obligation under sub-section (1) requiring manufacturers / suppliers to pass
on benefits of Input Tax Credits and/or reduction in rate of tax by way of commensurate reduction
in prices to the recipients. The said Section further W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters
18:24:48 enables the establishment of an Authority to determine whether Suppliers have passed on
the benefits of Input Tax Credits and reduction of the tax rates, and to exercise such other powers
and functions as may be prescribed.
101. This Court is in agreement with the submission of the Respondents that the objective behind
Section 171 is directly relatable to the Directive Principles of State Policy contained in Article 38(1)
of the Constitution which requires the State to strive to secure a social order in which justice, social,
economic and political shall inform all institutions of the national life and Articles 39(b) and (c) of
the Constitution which require the State to direct its policy towards ensuring that the ownership and
control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to sub-serve the
common good and that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of
wealth and means of production to the common detriment.
102. To summarise, Section 171 of the Act, 2017 mandates that whatever is saved in tax must be
reduced in price. Section 171 of the Act, 2017 incorporates the principle of unjust enrichment.
Accordingly, it has a flavor of consumer welfare regulatory measure, as it seeks to achieve the
primary objective behind the Goods and Services Tax regime i.e. to overcome the cascading effect of
indirect taxes and to reduce the tax burden on the final consumer. Consequently, the judgments of
Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (supra), Indian Carbon Limited (supra), V.V.S. Sugars
(supra) and Shree Bhagwati Steel Rolling Mills v. CCE (supra), relied on by the Petitioners, are not
applicable as they deal with the validity of delegated authority imposing tax/fee or charging interest
on delayed payment of tax in the absence of empowering provision in the statute.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 SECTION 171 FALLS WITHIN THE
LAW-MAKING POWER OF THE PARLIAMENT UNDER ARTICLE 246A
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
82
103. Article 246A of the Constitution of India defines the source of power as well as the field of
legislation (with respect to goods and services tax) obviating the need to refer to the Seventh
Schedule of the Constitution. Article 246A is available to both the Parliament and the State
Legislatures. The said Article embodies the constitutional principle of simultaneous levy as distinct
from the principle of concurrence. However, the Parliament has the exclusive power to enact Goods
and Services Tax legislation where the supply of goods or services takes place in the course of
inter-State trade or commerce. The Supreme Court in Union of India vs. VKC Footsteps India (P)
Ltd. (supra) has held, 'The One Hundred and First Amendment to the Constitution is a watershed
moment in the evolution of cooperative federalism'.
104. Article 246A of the Constitution of India empowers the Parliament and Legislatures to make
laws 'with respect to' goods and services tax. This expression is similar to that used in Article 246
which empowers the Parliament and State Legislatures to make laws 'with respect to' the various
subject-matters enumerated in the Seventh Schedule. The Supreme Court has consistently held that
the expression 'with respect to' is of wide amplitude and thus, the law making power with regard to
Goods and Services Tax includes all ancillary, incidental and necessary matters. In Welfare
Association, A.R.P., Maharashtra Vs. Ranjit P. Gohil, (2003) 9 SCC 358, the Supreme Court has held
as under:-
"28. The fountain source of legislative power exercised by Parliament or the State
Legislatures is not Schedule 7; the fountain source is Article 246 and other provisions
of the Constitution. The function of the three lists in the Seventh Schedule is merely
to demarcate legislative fields between Parliament and States and not to confer any
legislative power. The several entries mentioned in the three lists are fields of
legislation. The Constitution-makers purposely used general and W.P.(C) 7743/2019
& other connected matters 18:24:48 comprehensive words having a wide import
without trying to particularize. Such construction should be placed on the entries in
the lists as makes them effective; any construction which will result in any of the
entries being rendered futile or otiose must be avoided. That interpretation has
invariably been countenanced by the constitutional jurists, which gives the words
used in every entry the widest- possible amplitude. Each general word employed in
the entries has been held to carry an extended meaning so as to comprehend all
ancillary and subsidiary matters within the meaning of the entry so long as it can be
fairly accommodated subject to an overall limitation that the courts cannot extend
the field of an entry to such an extent as to result in inclusion of such matters as the
framers of the Constitution never intended to be included within the scope of the
entry or so as to transgress into the field of another entry placed in another list.
29. In every case where the legislative competence of a legislature in regard to a
particular enactment is challenged with reference to the entries in the various lists, it
is necessary to examine the pith and substance of the Act and to find out if the matter
comes substantially within an item in the list. The express words employed in an
entry would necessarily include incidental and ancillary matters so as to make the
legislation effective. The scheme of the Act under scrutiny, its object and purpose, its
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
83
true nature and character and the pith and substance of the legislation are to be
focused at. It is a fundamental principle of constitutional law that everything
necessary to the exercise of a power is included in the grant of the power (see the
Constitution Bench decision in Chaturbhai M. Patel v. Union of India [AIR 1960 SC
424 : (1960) 2 SCR 362] )."
(emphasis supplied)
105. In R.S. Joshi, Sales Tax Officer, Gujarat & Ors. vs. Ajit Mills Limited & Anr., (1977) 4 SCC 98, a
Seven-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court clearly held that providing for measures dealing with
aspects of unjustly retained amounts as tax in the concerned statute were necessary / ancillary
aspects connected with the subject of taxation. The relevant portion of the said judgment is
reproduced hereinbelow:-
"13. Bearing in mind the quintessential aspects of the rival contentions, let us stop
and take stock. The facts of the case are plain. The professed object of the law is clear.
The motive of the legislature is irrelevant to castigate an Act as a colourable device.
The interdict on public mischief and the insurance of consumer interests against
likely, albeit, unwitting or "ex abundanti cautela" excesses in the working of a statute
are not merely an ancillary power but surely a necessary obligation of a social welfare
state. One potent prohibitory process for this consummation is to penalize the trader
by casting a no-fault or absolute liability W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 to "cough up" to the State the total "unjust" takings snapped up and
retained by him "by way of tax" where tax is not so due from him, apart from other
punitive impositions to deter and to sober the merchants whose arts of dealing with
customers may include "many a little makes a mickle'. If these steps in reasoning
have the necessary nexus with the power to tax under Entry 54 List II, it passes one's
comprehension how the impugned legislation can be denounced as exceeding
legislative competence or as a "colourable device" or as "supplementary, not
complementary'. But this is precisely what the High Court has done, calling to its aid
passages culled from the rulings of this Court and curiously distinguishing an earlier
Division Bench decision of that very Court -- a procedure which, moderately
expressed, does not accord with comity, discipline and the rule of law. The puzzle is
how minds trained to objectify law can reach fiercely opposing conclusions.
xxx xxx xxx
24. In a developing country, with the mass of the people illiterate and below the
poverty line, and most of the commodities concerned constitute their daily
requirements, we see sufficient nexus between the power to tax and the incidental
power to protect purchasers from being subjected to an unlawful burden. Social
justice clauses, integrally connected with the taxing provisions, cannot be viewed as a
mere device or wanting in incidentality. Nor are we impressed with the contention
turning on the dealer being an agent (or not) of the State vis-a-vis sales tax ; and why
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
84
should the State suspect when it obligates itself to return the moneys to the
purchasers? We do not think it is more feasible for ordinary buyers to recover from
the common run of dealers small sums than from Government. We expect a sensitive
government not to bluff but to hand back. So, we largely disagree with Ashoka while
we generally agree with Abdul Quader. We must mention that the question as to
whether an amount which is illegally collected as sales tax can be forfeited did not
arise for consideration in Ashoka.
25. We may conclude with the thought that Parliament and the State legislatures will
make haste to inaugurate viable public interest litigation procedures cutting costs
and delays. After all, the reality of rights is their actual enjoyment by the citizen and
not a theoretical set of magnificent grants. "An acre in Middlesex', said Macaulay, "is
better than a principality in Utopia'. Added Prof. Schwartz : "A legal system that
works to serve the community is better than the academic conceptions of a bevy of
Platonic guardians unresponsive to public needs."
(emphasis supplied)
106. Keeping in view the aforesaid, this Court is of the view that the anti- profiteering mechanism as
incorporated in Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is in the exercise of the Parliament's power to legislate
on ancillary and necessary aspects/matters of Goods and Services Tax apart from being a social
welfare W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 measure as it amplifies and extends
the earlier concept of barring persons to undertake exercise of collecting monies from the
consumers by false representation.
107. Consequently, this Court is of the view that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 falls within the
law-making power of the Parliament under Article 246A of the Constitution dealing with the
ancillary and necessary aspects of Goods and Services Tax and is not beyond the legislative
competence of the Parliament.
SECTION 171 LAYS OUT A CLEAR LEGISLATIVE POLICY AND DOES NOT DELEGATE ANY
ESSENTIAL LEGISLATIVE FUNCTION
108. This Court is of the view that Section 171 of the Act 2017 is a complete code in itself and it does
not suffer from any ambiguity or arbitrariness. Section 171 of the Act 2017 sets out the function,
duty, responsibility and power of NAA with exactitude. It stipulates that the pre-conditions for
applicability of the provision are either the event of reduction in rate of tax or the availability of
benefit of input tax credit (resulting in such reduction). Once the said pre- requisites/conditions
exist, the direct consequence contemplated i.e. reduction of the price must follow. Therefore, if
before such reduction of rate of taxes or benefit of Input Tax Credit, the price paid by the recipient
inclusive of the applicable tax at the relevant time was a particular amount, then on account of the
reduction of the tax rate or the benefit of the Input Tax Credit, there has to be reduction in the
subject price. Further, the reduction in the tax rate or the benefit of Input Tax Credit which is
mandated to be passed on to the recipient is a matter of right for the recipient and consequentially,
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
85
the price reduction must be commensurate to such benefit. For instance, when the Goods and
Services Tax rate on a service of Rs.100 is 28%, the MRP of the service at which it is sold to W.P.(C)
7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 the consumer is Rs.128. When the Goods and
Services Tax rate is reduced by the Government from 28% to 18%, the provision requires that this
reduction in Goods and Services Tax rate should be reflected in the price of the service and the
benefit from such reduction of tax rate should be passed on to the consumers by way of
commensurate reduction in the price. As a result, the new MRP of the service should be Rs.118.
109. In Re The Delhi Laws Act AIR (1951) SC 332, while answering the question of what is an
essential legislative function, the Supreme Court held that "the essential legislative function consists
in the determination or choosing of the legislative policy and of formally enacting that policy into a
binding rule of conduct. It is open to the legislature to formulate the policy as broadly and with as
little or as much details as it thinks proper and it may delegate the rest of the legislative work to a
subordinate authority who will work out the details within the framework of that policy."
110. Keeping in view the aforesaid mandate of law, it is apparent that Section 171 of the Act, 2017
lays out a clear legislative policy. This Court is of the view that the necessary navigational tools,
guidelines as well as checks and balances have been incorporated in the provision itself to guide any
authority tasked with ensuring its workability. Consequently, Section 171 of the Act 2017 neither
delegates any essential legislative function nor violates Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
111. As per Section 171(2), the Central Government may, on recommendations of the Council, by
notification, constitute an Authority to examine whether Input Tax Credits availed by any registered
person or the reduction in the tax rate have actually resulted in a commensurate reduction in the
price of the goods or services. Section 171(3) of the Act, 2017 stipulates that the Authority i.e. NAA
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 shall exercise such powers and discharge
such function as may be prescribed. It is in exercise of this power that the Central Government has
enacted Rule 126 of the Rules, 2017 empowering NAA to determine the methodology and procedure
for determining whether the benefit has been passed on to the recipient by way of commensurate
reduction in prices. Consequently, on a conjoint reading of Sections 171(2) and 171(3) of the Act,
2017, it is evident that the powers conferred on NAA by the Central Government under Rule 126 of
the Rules, 2017 were intended by the Legislature to be exercised by the NAA itself. In fact, in
exercise of its powers under Rule 126 of the Rules, 2017, NAA has issued the 'National
Anti-Profiteering Authority: Methodology and Procedure, 2018' dated 28th March, 2018.
112. The Supreme Court in Sahni Silk Mills (P) Ltd. v. ESI Corpn., (1994) 5 SCC 346 while discussing
the maxim of delegatus non potest delegare has held that, "The basic principle behind the aforesaid
maxim is that "a discretion conferred by statute is prima facie intended to be exercised by the
authority on which the statute has conferred it and by no other authority, but this intention may be
negatived by any contrary indications found in the language, scope or object of the statute". (Vide
John Willis, "Delegatus non potest delegare, (1943) 21 Can. Bar Rev. 257, 259)". Therefore, the
principle of delegatus non potest delegare is not applicable to the present batch of matters.
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
86
113. Further, Section 166 of the Act, 2017 provides that every rule made by the Government in
exercise of its powers under Section 164 of the Act, 2017 shall be laid before each house of the
Parliament and that if both Houses agree to make any modification in the rule or both Houses agree
that the rule should not be made, the rule shall thereafter have effect only in such modified form or
be of no effect as the case maybe.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
114. The Supreme Court in D.S. Grewal v. State of Punjab 1958 SCC OnLine SC 9 in respect of a
similar provision in the All-India Services Act, 1951 has observed as follows:
" At the same time Parliament took care to see that these rules were laid on the table
of Parliament for fourteen days before they were to come into force and they were
subject to modification, whether by way of repeal or amendment on a motion made
by Parliament during the session in which they are so laid. This makes it perfectly
clear that Parliament has in no way abdicated its authority, but is keeping strict
vigilance and control over its delegate."
(emphasis supplied) [
115. Consequently, the Executive by framing Rule 126 of the Rules, 2017 has in no manner
encroached upon the jurisdiction of the Parliament. The Petitioners, throughout the hearing of the
case, have repeatedly pointed out that the NAA has adopted varied approaches with regard to
entities dealing with similar products in identical circumstances. If that is the case, then, it may
make the orders passed by NAA bad, but would not invalidate either Section 171 or the Rules framed
thereunder. Further, as the substantive mandate under Section 171(1) is itself a sound guiding
principle for the framing of Rules and the functioning of NAA, the argument that Rule 126 suffers
from excessive delegation is untenable in law.
IMPUGNED PROVISIONS ARE NOT A PRICE FIXING MECHANISM. THEY DO NOT VIOLATE
EITHER ARTICLE 19(1)(g) OR ARTICLE 300A OF THE CONSTITUTION
116. Section 171 of the Act, 2017 does not violate Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India, as it is
not a price-fixing mechanism. As rightly pointed out by the learned counsel for the Respondents,
Section 171 of the Act, 2017 only relates to the indirect-tax component of the price of goods and
services and does not impinge upon the freedom of suppliers to fix their own prices keeping in view
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 relevant commercial and economic factors.
This Court is in agreement with the learned Amicus Curiae that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is solely
focused on ensuring that the consequential benefit of reduction of the rate of tax by the Government
reaches the recipient.
117. The contention of the petitioners that the fundamental presumption under Section 171 that
every tax reduction must result in 'price reduction' is not correct. The use of the expression 'shall' in
Section 171 of the Act, 2017 means that the supplier is required to pass on the benefit of the reduced
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
87
tax rate and the benefit of Input Tax Credit, and that such passing on is to be carried out only by way
of commensurate reduction of price of the goods or services. Accordingly, costing and
market-related factors are irrelevant for NAA, as it is only required to examine whether or not there
is any reduction in tax rate or benefit of accruing Input Tax Credits and if so whether the same has
been passed on by way of commensurate reduction of prices. The NAA is not concerned with the
price determined by a supplier, for the supply of particular goods or services, exclusive of the GST or
Input Tax Credit component. The supplier is at liberty to set his base prices and vary them in
accordance with the relevant commercial and economic factors or any applicable laws.
Consequently, NAA is only mandated to ensure that the benefit of reduced rates of taxes and Input
Tax Credit is passed on. NAA cannot force the petitioners to sell their goods or services at reduced
prices.
118. This Court is of the view that the manufacturer/supplier despite reduction on rate of tax or
benefit of Input Tax Credits can raise the prices based on commercial factors, as long as the same is
not a pretense. During the hearing, Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel, conceded (as recorded
earlier) that in some cases, commercial factors might necessitate an increase in price despite
reduction in rate of tax or increase in availability of benefit of Input Tax Credits.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
119. This Court is in agreement with the submission of learned Amicus Curiae that if there is any
variation on account of other factors, such as any costs necessitating the setting off of such reduction
of price, the same needs to be justified by the supplier. The inherent presumption that these must
necessarily be a reduction in prices of the goods and services is a rebuttable presumption. It is
clarified that if the supplier is to assert reasons for offsetting the reduction, it must establish the
same on cogent basis and must not use it merely as a device to circumvent the statutory obligation of
reducing the prices in a commensurate manner contemplated under Section 171 of the Act, 2017.
120. This Court is further of the view that the present batch of matters deals with amounts that the
Revenue had foregone in favour of the consumers which however had been either wrongfully
appropriated by the petitioners/suppliers and/or used in their business and/or used for
cross-subsidisation and/or passed off as a special discount to the dealer or the consumer. Therefore,
there cannot be any proprietary interest of the suppliers in such amount which the Government has
foregone in favour of consumers by way of reduction in taxes and no legal or constitutional right can
be asserted thereunder.
121. Clearly, Section 171 of the Act, 2017 has been incorporated with the intent of creating a
framework that ensures that the benefit reaches the ultimate consumer. There cannot be any room
for allowing unjust retention of benefit of reduction in rate of tax or benefit of input tax credit with
the manufacturer/supplier/distributor. The reliance placed by the petitioners on the judgment of
CIT vs. B.C. Srinivasa Setty (1981) 2 SCC 460 and CCE vs. Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (2016) 1 SCC 170, is
completely misconceived as both these judgments were passed specifically in the context of levy of
taxes. As held hereinabove, Section 171 of the Act, 2017 does not levy any tax on supplies and
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 hence these judgments do not apply to the
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
88
present batch of matters. Consequently, the impugned provisions are not a price fixing mechanism
and they do not violate either Article 19(1)(g) or Article 14 or Article 300A of the Constitution of
India.
REFERENCE TO ANTI-PROFITEERING PROVISIONS OF AUSTRALIA AND MALAYSIA IS
MISCONCEIVED
122. The reference to Anti-profiteering provisions under the Australian Trade Practices Act by the
petitioners is misplaced as pointed out by the learned counsel for the Respondents and as according
to the petitioner's own submissions, the Australian Act prohibits 'price exploitation' in relation to
the New Tax System i.e. that the Act by its nature regulates prices. This is different from Section 171
of the Act, 2017 which only requires the suppliers to pass on the benefit of tax reduction and Input
Tax Credit to the recipients of the goods and services. The 'price' aspect comes into play in the
context of Section 171 of the Act, 2017 only when it comes to the manner in which the principal
obligation of passing on benefits as aforesaid, is to be carried out i.e., by way of commensurate
reduction of prices. Consequently, in the case of Section 171, there is no intent of any over- riding
regulation on 'price exploitation' like in the case of the Australian Trade Practices Act referred to by
the petitioners.
123. Similarly, the reference made by the petitioners to the Malaysian Price Control and
Anti-Profiteering Act, 2011 is also misplaced as the said Act, according to the petitioner's own
submission, prohibits suppliers from 'making unreasonably high profit'. By its very nature, the
Malaysian Act controls pricing unlike Section 171 of the Act, 2017 which does not seek to regulate
the pricing of the goods and services or the profits of the suppliers. Consequently, the reference to
Anti-Profiteering provisions of Australia and Malaysia is misconceived.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 NO FIXED/UNIFORM METHOD OR
MATHEMATICAL FORMULA CAN BE LAID DOWN FOR DETERMINING PROFITEERING
124. This Court is of the view that no fixed/uniform method or mathematical formula can be laid
down for determining profiteering as the facts of each case and each industry may be different. The
determination of the profiteered amount has to be computed by taking into account the relevant and
peculiar facts of each case. There is 'no one size that fits all' formula or method that can be
prescribed in the present batch of matters. Consequently, NAA has to determine the appropriate
methodology on a case to case basis keeping in view the peculiar facts and circumstances of each
case.
125. It is also well-established that where a power exists to prescribe a procedure and such power
has not been exercised, the implementing authorities are at liberty to determine and adopt such
procedure as they may deem fit subject to the same being fair and reasonable. In Dhanjibhai
Ramjibhai vs. State of Gujarat (1985) 2 SCC 5, the Supreme Court has held, "...Merely because
procedural rules have not been framed does not imply a negation of the power. In the absence of
such rules, it is sufficient that the power is exercised fairly and reasonably, having regard to the
context in which the power has been granted.". In Chairman & MD, BPL Ltd. vs. S.P. Gururaja and
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
89
Ors., (2003) 8 SCC 567, the Supreme Court has held, "....Under the Act or the Regulations framed
thereunder, no procedure for holding such consultations had been laid down. In that situation it was
open to the competent authorities to evolve their own procedure. Such a procedure of taking a
decision upon deliberations does not fall foul of Article 14 of the Constitution of India."
126. Consequently, Rule 126 of the Rules, 2017 to the extent it grants flexibility to NAA to determine
the methodology and procedure to decide whether reduction W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 in rate of tax or benefit of Input Tax Credit has been passed on or not to the
recipient is reasonable and legal. Moreover, as per Rule 126 NAA 'may determine' the methodology
and not 'prescribe' it. The substantive provision i.e. Section 171 of the Act, 2017 itself provides
sufficient guidance to NAA to determine the methodology on a case by case basis depending upon
peculiar facts of each case and the nature of the industry and its peculiarities. Consequently, so long
as the methodology determined by NAA is fair and reasonable, the petitioners cannot raise the
objection that the specifics of the methodology adopted are not prescribed.
127. Since considerable emphasis was laid by learned counsel for the Petitioners on the methodology
adopted by NAA to determine commensurate reduction qua real estate industry, this Court deems it
appropriate to deal with the same at some length. With the introduction of the Goods and Services
Tax scheme/regime, the availability of Input Tax Credit against various goods and services used in
construction has increased or Input Tax Credit was available against more goods and services then
before this resulted in a decrease in the cost of the builders as they now had more Input Tax Credit
available to be set off against Goods and Services Tax paid by them in the Goods and Services Tax
regime as compared to before and the same was not required to be collected from the consumers.
128. There is no dispute with regard to the methodology to be adopted in the following four
scenarios:-
a. If the flat was completely constructed in the pre-Goods and Services Tax period i.e.
before 01st July, 2017 and if it was purchased by making upfront payment of the
whole price in the pre-Goods and Services Tax period no benefit of Input Tax Credit
would be required to be passed on as the price will include W.P.(C) 7743/2019 &
other connected matters 18:24:48 the cost of taxes on which Input Tax Credit was not
available in the pre-Goods and Services Tax period viz. Central Excise Duty, Entry
Tax etc. b. If the construction of the flat had started in the pre-Goods and Services
Tax period and continued/completed in the post-Goods and Services Tax period and
a buyer purchased the flat by making full upfront payment in the post-Goods and
Services Tax period he is entitled to the benefit of Input Tax Credit on the material
which has been purchased in respect of this flat during the post-Goods and Services
Tax period and on which benefit of Input Tax Credit has been availed by the builder.
The builder has to reduce the price commensurately and pass on the benefit. c. If the
construction of the flat is started in the pre-Goods and Services Tax period and its
construction was continued in the post-Goods and Services Tax period and it was
purchased by the consumer by paying the full amount of price upfront in the pre-
Goods and Services Tax period, the buyer is entitled to claim benefit of Input Tax
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
90
Credit on the taxes paid on the construction material purchased by the builder in the
post-Goods and Services Tax period during which he has been given benefit of Input
Tax Credit on the taxes on which Input Tax Credit was not available in the pre-Goods
and Services Tax and cost of such taxes has been built in the price of the flat by the
builder.
d. If the flat is constructed in the post-Goods and Services Tax period and it is
purchased after construction being complete by making upfront payment of the full
price, no benefit of Input Tax W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters
18:24:48 Credit would be available as the price of the flat would have been fixed after
taking into account the Input Tax Credit which has become available to the builder in
the post-Goods and Services Tax period and which was not available to him in the
pre-Goods and Services Tax.
129. However, this Court finds that the methodology adopted by NAA and DGAP to arrive at the
profiteering amount of the real estate industry was generally based on the difference between the
ratio of Input Tax Credit to turnover under the pre-Goods and Services and Tax and post- Goods
and Services and Tax period. This Court is in agreement with the contention of the learned counsel
for the petitioners representing the real estate companies that the methodology adopted by NAA is
flawed as in the real estate sector, there is no direct correlation between the turnover and the Input
Tax Credit availed for a particular period. The expenses in a real estate project are not uniform
throughout the life cycle of the project and the eligibility of credit depends on the nature of the
construction activity undertaken during the particular period. As it is an admitted position that
neither the advances received nor the construction activity is uniform throughout the life cycle of the
project, the accrual of Input Tax Credit is not related to the amount collected from the buyers. This
Court is in agreement with learned counsel of the petitioners that one needs to calculate the total
savings on account of introduction of Goods and Services and Tax for each project and then divide
the same by total area to arrive at the per square feet benefit to be passed on to each flat buyer. This
would ensure that flat-buyers with equal square feet area received equal benefit. The Court, while
hearing the present batch of matters on merits, shall take the aforesaid direction/interpretation into
account.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 IT IS THE PREROGATIVE OF THE
LEGISLATURE TO DECIDE HOW THE BENEFIT IS TO BE PASSED ON TO THE CONSUMERS
130. It is settled law that it is the prerogative of the Legislature to decide the manner as to how the
reduction in rate of tax or the benefit of Input Tax Credit is to be passed on to the consumer. In
Dr.Ashwani Kumar vs. Union of India, (2020) 13 SCC 585, the Supreme court has held as under:-
"11. The legislature as an elected and representative body enacts laws to give effect to
and fulfil democratic aspirations of the people. The procedures applied are designed
to give careful thought and consideration to wide and divergent interests, voices and
all shades of opinion from different social and political groups. Legislature functions
as a deliberative and representative body. It is directly accountable and answerable to
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
91
the electorate and citizens of this country. This representativeness and principle of
accountability is what gives legitimacy to the legislations and laws made by
Parliament or the State Legislatures. Article 245 of the Constitution empowers
Parliament and the State Legislatures to enact laws for the whole or a part of the
territory of India, and for the whole or a part of the State respectively, after due
debate and discussion in Parliament/the State Assembly."
(emphasis supplied)
131. In the present instance, the legislative mandate is that reduction of the tax rate or the benefit of
Input Tax Credit must not only be reflected in reduction of prices but it must also reach the recipient
of the goods or services. Such a mandate cannot be tampered with by the supplier by substituting
the benefit in the form of reduction of actual price with any other form such as increase in volume or
weight or by supply of additional or free material or festival discount like 'Diwali Dhamaka' or
cross-subsidisation.
132. Further, the requirement that the benefit of the rate reduction and Input Tax Credit reach the
final consumer by way of 'cash in hand' through commensurate reduction in prices, cannot be said
to be manifestly arbitrary. No fundamental or other rights of any of the petitioners are being
affected in any manner by W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 requiring that
the benefit in reduction of tax rate or Input Tax Credits, be passed on to the recipients by way of
commensurate reduction in prices.
133. This Court is in agreement with the submission of Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel for the
Respondents, that the benefit of tax reduction has to be passed on at the level of each supply of SKU
to each buyer and in case it is not passed on, the profiteered amount has to be calculated on each
SKU.
134. The contention of the learned counsel for the Petitioners that it is legally impossible to pass on
the benefits by reducing the price of goods in cases of low priced products is untenable in law. As
pointed out by Mr.Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel for the Respondents, the provisions of the Legal
Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 are applicable. In cases for period prior to 31st
December, 2017, the erstwhile Rule 2(m) of the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules,
2011 which provided detailed instructions for rounding off of the MRP would be applicable.
Similarly, Rule 6(1)(e) of the above Rules as amended in 2017 with effect from 01st January, 2018 to
31st March, 2022 provides that the retail price of the package shall clearly indicate that it is the MRP
inclusive of all taxes and the price in rupees and paise be rounded off to the nearest rupee or 50
paise would be applicable. Consequently, there would be no legal impossibility in reducing the MRP
even in such cases. There is nothing inconsistent in Section 171 with such rounding off.
ACT 2017 RIGHTLY DOES NOT FIX A TIME PERIOD DURING WHICH PRICE-REDUCTION HAS
TO BE OFFERED
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
92
135. This Court is in agreement with the submissions of the respondents and the learned Amicus
Curiae that bearing in mind the very nature of the Act, 2017, it is not proper or feasible to
contemplate any specific period of time for application of W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 the reduced price, as the same has to take effect so long as the direct relation
between the reduction of tax rate or the benefit of Input Tax Credits exists and there is no other
factor effecting/countering the same. If, conceptually, the reduction of tax rate has taken place on a
specified date and there are no justified variations in the cost price or other factors for offsetting
such reduction in the prices for a particular period of time, clearly for that period a reduced price
must govern the transaction. This Court is of the view that providing for a particular period of time
for operation of the provisions would be not be in conformity with the scheme and intent of the Act,
2017 itself.
SECTION 64A OF SALE OF GOODS ACT IS NOT APPLICABLE TO THE OBLIGATION UNDER
SECTION 171
136. This Court is in agreement with the submission of learned counsel for the Respondents that
Section 64A of Sale of Goods Act, 1930 has no applicability to the obligation under Section 171 of the
Act, 2017 as the former only confers a discretion on the buyer to reduce the contract price to the
extent of reduction in taxes, whereas Section 171 imposes a positive obligation on the supplier to
make a commensurate reduction in the price when the Government reduces the rate of tax.
Therefore there is no inconsistency between the two laws.
137. Moreover, the CGST/SGST Acts, 2017 are independent Acts and there is no provision under
these Acts that tax reduction ordered under these Acts would be subject to the provisions of Sale of
Goods Act, 1930 or the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Tax reduction is given by sacrificing tax revenue
and hence the Governments are legally competent to direct the suppliers to pass on the benefit of
such tax reduction to the consumers after its notification. Any contract made in violation of public
policy of passing on the benefit would be void. Consequently, W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 all contracts (a) whether they are pending to be performed or (b) executed after
tax reduction and/or (c) have already been concluded before tax reduction, have to implemented
keeping in view the mandate enshrined in Section 171 of the Act, 2017.
A STATUTORY PROVISION CANNOT BE STRUCK DOWN ON THE GROUND OF POSSIBILITY
OF ABUSE
138. During the course of hearing, learned counsel for the petitioners advanced a number of
hypothetical situations to suggest that there is a possibility of abuse of Section 171 of the Act, 2017.
However, it is settled law that Acts and their provisions are not to be declared unconstitutional on
the fanciful theory that power would be exercised in an unrealistic fashion or in a vacuum or on the
ground that there is an apprehension of misuse of statutory provision or possibility of abuse of
power. It must be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that administration and application of a
particular law would be done "not with an evil eye and unequal hand". Some of the relevant
Supreme Court judgments are reproduced hereinbelow:-
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
93
A. In Maganlal Chhaganlal (P) Ltd. Vs. Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay &
Ors., (1974) 2 SCC 402 it has been held as under:-
"15.....The statute itself in the two classes of cases before us clearly lays down the
purpose behind them, that is that premises belonging to the Corporation and the
Government should be subject to speedy procedure in the matter of evicting
unauthorized persons occupying them. This is a sufficient guidance for the
authorities on whom the power has been conferred. With such an indication clearly
given in the statutes one expects the officers concerned to avail themselves of the
procedures prescribed by the Acts and not resort to the dilatory procedure of the
ordinary civil court. Even normally one cannot imagine an officer having the choice
of two procedures, one which enables him to get possession of the property quickly
and the other which would be a prolonged one, to resort to the latter. Administrative
officers, no less than the courts, do not function in a vacuum. It would be extremely
unreal to hold that an administrative officer would in taking W.P.(C) 7743/2019 &
other connected matters 18:24:48 proceedings for eviction of unauthorised occupants
of Government property or Municipal property resort to the procedure prescribed by
the two Acts in one case and to the ordinary civil court in the other. The provisions of
these two Acts cannot be struck down on the fanciful theory that power would be
exercised in such an unrealistic fashion. In considering whether the officers would be
discriminating between one set of persons and another, one has got to take into
account normal human behaviour and not behaviour which is abnormal. It is not
every fancied possibility of discrimination but the real risk of discrimination that we
must take into account. This is not one of those cases where discrimination is writ
large on the face of the statute. Discrimination may be possible but is very
improbable. And if there is discrimination in actual practice this Court is not
powerless. Furthermore, the fact that the Legislature considered that the ordinary
procedure is insufficient or ineffective in evicting unauthorised occupants of
Government and Corporation property and provided a special speedy procedure
therefore is a clear guidance for the authorities charged with the duty of evicting
unauthorised occupants. We, therefore, find ourselves unable to agree with the
majority in the Northern India Caterers case."
(emphasis supplied) B. In Collector of Customs v. Nathella Sampathu Chetty, 1962 SCC OnLine SC
30 , the Supreme Court has held as under:-
"34....This Court has held in numerous rulings, to which it is unnecessary to refer,
that the possibility of the abuse of the powers under the provisions contained in any
statute is no ground for declaring the provision to be unreasonable or void. *** The
possibility of abuse of a statute otherwise valid does not impart to it any element of
invalidity. The converse must also follow that a statute which is otherwise invalid as
being unreasonable cannot be saved by its being administered in a reasonable
manner. The constitutional validity of the statute would have to be determined on the
basis of its provisions and on the ambit of its operation as reasonably construed. If so
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
94
judged it passes the test of reasonableness, possibility of the powers conferred being
improperly used is no ground for pronouncing the law itself invalid and similarly if
the law properly interpreted and tested in the light of the requirements set out in Part
III of the Constitution does not pass the test it cannot be pronounced valid merely
because it is administered in a manner which might not conflict with the
constitutional requirements. In saying this we are not to be understood as laying
down that a law which might operate, harshly but still be constitutionally valid
should be operated always with harshness or that reasonableness and justness ought
not to guide the actual administration of such laws."
(emphasis supplied) W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 C. In Mafatlal
Industries Ltd. v. Union of India, (1997) 5 SCC 536, a nine Judge Bench of the Supreme Court while
considering the validity of provisions of the Central Excise and Customs Law (Amendment) Act,
1991 has held as under:-
"88.....It is equally well-settled that mere possibility of abuse of a provision by those
in charge of administering it cannot be a ground for holding the provision
procedurally or substantively unreasonable. In Collector of Customs v. Nathella
Sampathu Chetty [(1962) 3 SCR 786 : AIR 1962 SC 316] , this Court observed:
"The possibility of abuse of a statute otherwise valid does not impart to it any element
of invalidity." It was said in State of Rajasthan v. Union of India [(1977) 3 SCC 592 :
(1978) 1 SCR 1] (SCR at p. 77), "it must be remembered that merely because power
may sometimes be abused, it is no ground for denying the existence of power. The
wisdom of man has not yet been able to conceive of a government with power
sufficient to answer all its legitimate needs and at the same time incapable of
mischief". (Also see Commr., H.R.E. v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri
Shirur Mutt [1954 SCR 1005 : AIR 1954 SC 282] (SCR at p. 1030)."
(emphasis supplied) TO NOT COMPARE TAXES LEVIED AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF THE
ACT, 2017 WITH A BASKET OF DISTINCT INDIRECT TAXES APPLICABLE BEFORE THE
OPERATION OF THE ACT WOULD GO AGAINST THE INTENT AND OBJECTIVE OF ACT, 2017.
139. Prior to coming into force of the Act, 2017, several taxes were levied on goods and services by
the Central Government (such as Central Excise tax, Service tax, Central Sales tax etc.) and by the
State Government (such as Value Added tax, Luxury tax, Purchase tax etc.). There was multiplicity
of taxes as they were levied on the same supply system. This had a cascading effect as there was no
provision for set off. The Hon'ble Prime Minister at the launch of Goods and Services Tax stated "If
we take into consideration the 29 states, the 7 Union Territories, the 7 taxes of the Centre and the 8
taxes of the States, and several different taxes for different commodities, the number of taxes sum
up to a figure W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 of 500! Today all those taxes
will be shred off to have ONE NATION, ONE TAX right from Ganganagar to Itanagar and from Leh
to Lakshdweep".
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024

95
140. Additionally, a plethora of non-tariff barriers like octroi, entry tax, check posts etc. hindered
free flow of trade throughout the country and this entailed a high compliance cost for taxpayers. The
Act, 2017 has subsumed the earlier catena of indirect taxes (Central as well as State indirect taxes),
inasmuch as, it levies a single tax on the supply of goods and services. Consequently, the submission
of learned senior counsel for the Petitioner in W.P.(C) 1171/2020 that Section 171(1) of the Act, 2017
does not contemplate a comparison of the taxes levied after the introduction of the Act, 2017 with a
basket of distinct indirect taxes applicable on goods and services before the operation of the Act goes
against the grain, intent and object of the Act, 2017.
THERE IS NO VESTED RIGHT OF APPEAL AND AN APPEAL IS A CREATURE OF THE STATUTE
141. As discussed earlier, Rule 129 of the Rules, 2017 provides for a comprehensive mechanism for
initiation and conduct of proceedings relating to anti-profiteering. The conscious provisioning of
different layers of examination which, in the first place, is purely fact-based clearly demonstrates
that appropriate precautions and redressal measures are provided for in the Scheme of the Act, 2017
read with the Rules, 2017 in connection therewith on the subject of Anti- Profiteering. Consequently,
there is no basis for contending that unbrindled powers have been given to the Authority or that
there is a lack of appropriate redressal mechanism under the Scheme.
142. In any event, it is well settled that there is no vested right of appeal and an appeal is a creature
of the Statute. Right of appeal is neither a natural nor an inherent right vested in a party. It is a
substantive statutory right regulated by the W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
Statute creating it. To provide for an appeal or not under a Statute is a pure question of legislative
policy (See: Kondiba Dagadu Kadam v. Savitribai Sopan Gujar (1999) 3 SCC 722 and Kashmir Singh
v. Harnam Singh (2008) 12 SCC
796).
143. If Legislature chooses not to provide for a right to appeal against an order of the authority that
itself cannot be a ground to declare an enactment as unconstitutional. This Court in Wing
Commander Shyam Naithani vs. Union of India and Ors., W.P.(C) 6483/2021 & connected matters,
2022 SCC OnLine Del 769 has held as under:
"40. However, this Court would like to clarify that a right to appeal is a creation of
Statute and it cannot be claimed as a matter of right. The right to appeal has to exist.
It cannot be created by acquiescence of the parties or by the order of the Court. It is
neither a natural nor an inherent right attached to the litigant being a substantive,
statutory right. [See: United Commercial Bank Ltd. v. Their Workmen, AIR 1951 SC
230; Kondiba Dagdu Kodam v. Savitribai Sopan Gujar, AIR 1999 SC 2213; and UP
Power Corporation Ltd. v. Virenddra Lal, (2013) 10 SCC 39]. Jurisdiction cannot be
conferred by mere acceptance, acquiescence, consent or by any other means as it can
be conferred only by the legislature as conferring jurisdiction upon a Court or
Authority, is a legislative function..."

144. Further, the decisions of NAA are subject to judicial review under Article 226 before the
jurisdictional High Courts as is evident from the fact that several petitions have been filed before
this Court challenging orders of the NAA. This shows that the affected parties are exercising their
right to seek remedies under Article 226 against orders of NAA.
145. Consequently, a robust mechanism in conformity with the constitutional requirements is in
place for dealing with grievances of breach of Section 171(1) of the Act, 2017 and hence, it cannot be
said that there is no judicial oversight over the decisions of NAA [See: CCI v. SAIL (supra), Shiv
Shakti Coop. Housing Society v. Swaraj Developers, (2003) 6 SCC 659].

146. By its very nature, Section 171(1) of the Act, 2017 clearly lays down the express issues which
need to be examined by the Authority and this examination is in the nature of a fact-finding
exercise. Therefore, the mandate of the Authority is very specific in nature and is akin to a
fact-finding exercise. This Court is of the opinion that NAA is primarily a fact-finding body which is
required to investigate whether suppliers have passed on the benefit to their recipients by way of
reduced prices as mandated by Section 171 of the Act, 2017. On examining the role and duties of
NAA under Section 171(2) of the Act, 2017 and Rule 127 of the Rules, 2017, it is apparent that NAA
performs functions that are to be discharged by domain experts.
147. Even otherwise NAA has not assumed any jurisdiction which was hitherto being exercised by
the High Court or any other judicial body, and so, the principle that there must be a judicial member
in quasi-judicial entities as laid down in the decisions relied upon by the petitioners does not apply
in the present batch of matters.
148. In the case of Namit Sharma vs. Union of India (2013) 1 SCC 745, the Supreme Court
considered the question of the requirement of a judicial member for performing the functions and
exercising the powers of the Chief Information Commissioner. The Supreme Court initially held that
the Information Commission and the Central Information Commissioners perform judicial
functions possessing the essential attributes and trappings of a court and hence, it must have
judicial members. However, while deciding the review petition filed by the Union of India, the
Supreme Court in its judgment reported as Union of India vs. Namit Sharma (2013) 10 SCC 359 has
held that "the powers exercised W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 by the
Information Commissions under the Act were not earlier vested in the High Court or subordinate
court or any other court and are not in any case judicial powers and therefore the legislature need
not provide for appointment of judicial members in the Information Commission."
149. Similarly, statutory bodies like TRAI, Medical Council of India, Institute of Chartered
Accountant of India etc., perform quasi-judicial functions but do not have judicial members.
Furthermore, Assessing Officers, CIT(Appeals) and the Dispute Resolution Panel under the Income
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024

97
Tax Act, 1961 all perform quasi- judicial functions but there is no requirement that such members
must possess either a law degree or have judicial experience. Consequently, this Court is of the view
that there is no requirement for a judicial member in NAA.
150. While this Court is in agreement with the submission of the Petitioners that the provision of a
second or casting vote to the Chairman in the event of a tie/equality of votes as was given in Rule
134(2) of the Rules, 2017 is impermissible, yet as the Respondents have stated that the said
provision has never been used, this Court does not deem it necessary to delve into a detailed
discussion of the same.
151. Additionally, the Petitioners have challenged the validity of the constitution of the NAA on
account of absence of a gazette notification as allegedly required under Section 171(2) of the Act,
2017. This Court is of the opinion that this issue does not affect the constitutional validity of the
impugned section which is presently under consideration and so this issue is not being dealt with in
the present judgment.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 RULE 124 IS IN CONSONANCE WITH
ARTICLE 50. THERE IS NO SCOPE FOR GOVERNMENTAL INTERFERENCE IN FUNCTIONS
EXERCISED BY NAA
152. This Court is of the view that Rule 124 of the Rules, 2017 is in consonance with Article 50 of the
Constitution, inasmuch as, selection to NAA is made on the recommendation by a Selection
Committee constituted by the Goods and Services Tax Council which is a constitutional body.
Similarly the services of the Chairperson and members of NAA can be terminated only with the
approval of the Chairman of the Goods and Services Tax Council. Consequently, the members of
NAA are free to carry out their function as they deem fit and there is no scope whatsoever for any
Governmental interference in the functions exercised by NAA.
RULE 133 TO THE EXTENT IT PROVIDES FOR LEVY OF INTEREST AND PENALTY IS WITHIN
THE RULE MAKING POWER OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
153. This Court is of the view that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is broad enough to empower the
Central Government to prescribe penalty and interest to ensure that the suppliers are deterred from
pocketing the benefits meant for the consumers when taxes are foregone by the Government. Merely
empowering NAA to direct returning of the amounts so pocketed by the supplier/registered person
would not have a sufficient deterrent effect on deviant behavior unless interest and penalty are
levied to prevent such actions from taking place in the first place. The width and amplitude of
Section 171 by which the authority is empowered to ensure that reduction in tax rate or the Input
Tax Credit availed results in commensurate reduction in the price of goods or services clearly
encompasses within it the power to ensure that such conduct which leads to profiteering does not
take place.

154. Section 164 of the Act, 2017 gives power to the Government to make rules for carrying out
provisions of the Act and in particular to provide for penalty. Section 164 of the Act, 2017 is
reproduced hereinbelow:-
"164. Power of Government to make rules (1) The Government may, on the
recommendations of the Council, by notification, make rules for carrying out the
provisions of this Act.
(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of sub-section (1), the
Government may make rules for all or any of the matters which by this Act are
required to be, or may be, prescribed or in respect of which provisions are to be or
may be made by rules.
(3) The power to make rules conferred by this section shall include the power to give
retrospective effect to the rules or any of them from a date not earlier than the date
on which the provisions of this Act come into force.
(4) Any rules made under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) may provide that a
contravention thereof shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding ten thousand rupees."
155. Accordingly, Rule 133(3)(b)&(d) of the Rules, 2017 which empower the authority to levy
interest @ 18% from the date of collection of the higher amount till the date of the return of such
amount as well as imposition of penalty are intra vires and within the Rule making power of the
Central Government.
156. Moreover, as pointed out by Mr. Zoheb Hossain, the show cause notices initiating penalty
proceedings in relation to violation of Section 171(1) prior to the coming into force of Section
171(3A), have been withdrawn by NAA and penalty proceedings in all such cases are not being
pressed. Consequently, this issue has become infructuous.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 GOODS AND SERVICES TAX
COLLECTED ON THE ADDITIONAL REALIZATION HAS RIGHTLY BEEN INCLUDED IN THE
PROFITEERED AMOUNT
157. Both the Central as well as the State Government had no intent of collecting additional Goods
and Services Tax on the higher price as they had sacrificed their revenue in favour of the buyer. By
compelling the buyers to pay the additional Goods and Services Tax on a higher price, the supplier
has not only defeated the intent of the Governments but has also acted against the interest of the
consumer and therefore, the Goods and Services Tax collected by him on the additional realization
has rightly been included in the profiteered amount.
TIME LIMIT FOR FURNISHING OF REPORT BY DGAP IS DIRECTORY AND NOT MANDATORY
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024

99
158. In some cases, the Petitioners have pointed out that the timelines as provided in the Rules, 2017
have not been followed. They further contended that as a result, the proceedings are vitiated.
However, it is important to note that the Rules, 2017 do not provide any consequences in case the
time limits provided thereunder lapse. As held earlier, the anti-profiteering provisions in the Act,
2017 and the Rules, 2017 are in the nature of a beneficial legislation as they promote consumer
welfare. The Courts have consistently held that beneficial legislation must receive liberal
construction that favors the consumer and promotes the intent and objective of the Act. That being
the scenario, it cannot be said that the proceedings as a whole abate on lapse of time limit of
furnishing of report by DGAP. The Supreme Court in P.T. Rajan Vs. T.P.M. Sahir and Ors. (2003) 8
SCC 498 has held that "It is well-settled principle of law that where a statutory functionary is asked
to perform a statutory duty within the time prescribed W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 therefore, the same would be directory and not mandatory." and that "a provision
in a statute which is procedural in nature although employs the word "shall" may not be held to be
mandatory if thereby no prejudice is caused." Consequently, the time limit provided for furnishing
of report by DGAP is directory in nature and not mandatory.
EXPANSION OF INVESTIGATION BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE COMPLAINT IS NOT ULTRA
VIRES THE STATUTE
159. Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is widely worded and does not limit the scope of examination to
only goods and services in respect of which a complaint is received. The scope of powers of the
DGAP is provided for in Rule 129 of the Rules, 2017. From a reading of the said Rule especially the
expression 'any supply of goods or services' used in sub-rule (2) of Rule 129, it is apparent that the
scope of the DGAP's powers is very wide and is not limited to the goods or services in relation to
which a Complaint is received. The word 'any' includes within its scope 'some' as well as 'all'.
160. In any event, the ignorance of the consumer or lack of information or surrounding complexity
in the supply chain cannot be permitted to defeat the objective of a consumer welfare regulatory
measure and it is in this light that the subject provision is required to be construed.
161. In the context of similar powers of investigation exercised by the Director General under the
Competition Act, 2002, the Supreme Court in Excel Crop Care Ltd. vs. Competition Commission of
India, (2017) 8 SCC 47, has held that the Director General would be well within its powers to
investigate and report on matters not covered by the complaint or the reference order of the
Commission, and an interpretation to the contrary would render the entire purpose of investigation
nugatory. The High Court of Delhi in Cadila Healthcare Ltd. & W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other
connected matters 18:24:48 Anr. vs. CCI & Ors., (2018) SCCOnline Del 11229, relying on the
judgment of the Supreme Court in Excel Crop Care (supra) has clarified in express terms that the
scope of investigation by the Director General is not restricted to the matter stated in the Complaint
and includes other allied as well as unenumerated matters. Consequently, the expansion of
investigation or proceedings beyond the scope of the complaint is not ultra vires the statute.

162. Before parting with the present batch of matters, this Court places on record its appreciation for
the assistance rendered by all the learned counsel, who appeared, in particular, Mr. Amar Dave,
learned Amicus Curiae, Mr. V. Lakshmikumaran and Mr. Zoheb Hossain, Advocates as they filed not
only multiple written submissions but also ensured that hearing in the present batch of matters
(exceeding 100 cases) was conducted in an orderly and proper manner.
TO SUM UP
163. Keeping in view the aforesaid conclusions, the constitutional validity of Section 171 of Act, 2017
as well as Rules 122, 124, 126, 127, 129, 133 and 134 of the Rules, 2017 is upheld. This Court clarifies
that it is possible that there may be cases of arbitrary exercise of power under the anti-profiteering
mechanism by enlarging the scope of the proceedings beyond the jurisdiction or on account of not
considering the genuine basis of variations in other factors such as cost escalations on account of
which the reduction stands offset, skewed input credit situations etc. However, the remedy for the
same is to set aside such orders on merits. What will be struck down in such cases will not be the
provision itself which invests such power on the concerned authority but the erroneous application
of the power.

J U D G M E N T S The following Judgments of the Court were delivered"
WITH CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 15536-37, 15532-15534 OF 1996 (Arising out of SLP (C)
Nos. 7418-19/92 and 12353-55/95) J U D G M E N T K. Ramaswamy, J.
Leave granted.
These appeals by special leave arise form the judgment of the Division Bench of the
Bombay High Court dated April 28, 1992 made in Appeal No. 146 of 1990 and batch.
The facts in appeal arising out of S.L.P. 7417/92, are sufficient to decide the questions
of law that have arisen in these appeals. The appellant initially was a statutory
authority under International Airport Authority of India Act. 1971 (for short, 'IAAI
Act') and on its repeal by the Airports Authority of India Act, 1994 was amalgamated
with National Airport Authority (for short, the 'NAA') under single nomenclature,
namely, IAAI. The IAAI is now reconstituted as a company under Companies Act,
1956.
The appellants engaged, as contract labour the respondent union's members, for
sweeping, cleaning dusting and watching of the building owned ad occupied by the
appellant. The Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 (for Short, the
'Act') regulates registration of the establishment of principal employer, the contractor
engaging and supplying the contract labour in every establishment i which 20 or
more workmen are employed o ay day of the preceding 12 months as contract labour.
The appellant had obtained on September 20,1971 a certificate of registration form
Regional Labour Commissioner (Central) under the Act. The Central Government,
exercising the power under Section 10 of the Act, on the basis of recommendation
and in consultation with the Central Advisory Board constituted under Section 10(1)
of the Act, issued a notification on December 9,1976 prohibiting "employment of
contract labour on and from December 9,1976 for sweeping, cleaning, dusting and
watching of buildings owned or occupied by the establishment in respect of which the
appropriate government under the said act is the Central Government". However, the
said prohibition was not apply to "outside cleaning and other maintenance
operations of multi- storeyed building where such cleaning or maintenance cannot be
carried out expect with specialised experience." It would appear that Regional Labour
Commissioner(Central) Bombay by letter dated January 20,1972 informed the
appellant that the State Government is the appropriate Government under the Act.
Therefore, by proceedings dated May 22, 1973 the Regional Labour Commissioner
(Central) had revoked the registration. By Amendment Act 46 of 1982, the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947 (for short, the 'ID Act') was made applicable to the appellant and
was brought on statute book specifying the appellant as one of the industries in
relation to which the Central Government is the appropriate Government and the
appellant has been carrying on its business "by or under its authority" with effect
form August 21,1982. The Act was amended bringing within its ambit the Central
Government as appropriate Government by amendment Act 14 of 1986 with effect

from January 28,1986.
Since the appellant did not abolish the contract system and failed to enforce the
notification of the Government of India dated December 9,1976, the respondents
came to file writ petitions for direction to the appellant to enforce forthwith the
aforesaid notification abolishing the contract labour system in the aforesaid services
and to direct the appellant to absorb all the employees doing cleaning, sweeping,
dusting, washing and watching of the building owned or occupied by the
appellant-establishment, with effect from the respective dates of their joining as
contract labour in the appellant's establishment with all consequential
rights/benefits, monetary or otherwise, The writ petition was allowed by the leaned
single judge on November 16,1989 directing that all contract workers be regularised
as employees of the appellant from the date of filing of the writ petition. Preceding
thereto, on November 15, 1989, the Government of India referred to the Central
Advisory Board known as While Committee under section 10(1), which recommended
to the Central Government not to abolish the contract labour system in the aforesaid
services. Under the impugned judgment dated April 3,1992, the learned judges of the
Division Bench dismissed the appeal. Similar was the fate of other appeals. Thus
these appeals by special leave.
Shri Ashok Desai, the learned Attorney General, Shri Andhyarujina, the learned
Solicitor General, Appearing for Union of India and the appellant respectively,
contended that the term "appropriate Government" under section 2 (1)(a) of the Act,
as on December 9, 1976, was the State Government. The appellant was not carrying
on the business as an agent of the Central Government nor the Central Government
was its principal. This Court, in Heavy Engineering Majdoor Union v. The State of
Bihar & Ors. [ (1969) 3 SCR 995 (for short, the "Heavy Engineering case"], had
interpreted the phrase "the appropriate Government" and held that the Central
Government was not the appropriate Government under the ID Act. The ratio therein
was followed in Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. v. The Workmen & Ors. [(1975) 4 SCC
679] and Rashtriya Mill Mazdoor Sangh v. Model Mills Nagpur & Anr. [1984 Supp.
SCC 443] and food Corp. of India Workers' Union v. Food Corp. Of India &
Ors.[(1985) 2 SCC 294], It is thus firmly settled law that the appropriate Government
until the Act was amended with effect from January 28,1986. Therefore, the view of
the High Court that the appropriate Government is the Central Government is not
correct in law. The learned Attorney General Further argued that the interpretation
of this Court in Heavy Engineering case has stood the test of time and the parties
have settled the transaction its basis. It would, therefore, not be correct to upset that
interpretation. The learned Solicitor General contended that the notification
published by the Central Government under Section 10 of the Act on December 9,
1976 was without jurisdiction. The Advisory Board independently should consider
whether the contract labour in each of the aforestated services should be abolished
taking into consideration the perennial nature of the work, the requirement of
number of employees in the respective specified services in the establishment of the

appellant.
The Advisory Board had not adverted to the prescribed criteria of Section 10 (2) of the appellant's
establishment. Mohile Committee after detailed examination, had recommended to the Central
Government not to abolish the contract labour system in the aforesaid services. It was contended
that the notification dated December 9, 1976 is without authority of law or, at any rate, is clearly
illegal and so the direction by the High Court to enforce the offending notification is not correct in
law. It was come into force from January 28, 1986, the Central Government being the appropriate
Government, had accepted the recommendation of Mohile Committee of not abolishing the contract
labour system. The notification dated December 9, 1976 no longer remained valid for enforcement.
The High Court, therefore was not right in directing the appellant to enforce the notification.
Alternatively, it was contended that even assuming that the notification is valid and enforceable, it
would be effective only from January, 1986. However, by abolition of contract labour system, the
workmen would not automatically became the employees of the appellant. In Dena Nath and Ors.
[(1992) 1 SCC 695], this court had held that the High Court, in exercise of its power under Article
226, has o power to direct absorption of the contract labour as its direct employees. The impugned
judgment was expressly disapproved in Dena Nath's case. Therefore, its legality has been knocked
off its bottom. It was further contended that the Act, on abolition of the contract labour system, does
not envisage to c r ea t e direct relationship between the principal employer and the contract labour.
The erstwhile contract labour have to seek and obtain industrial award under the ID Act by virtue of
which the appellant would be entitled to satisfy the Industrial Court that there was no need to
absorb all the contract labour but only smaller number is required as regular employees. On
recording finding in that behalf, the industrial court would make his award which would be
enforceable by the workmen. This court in Gujarat Electricity Board v. Hind Mazdoor Sabha & Ors.
[(1995) 5 SCC 27] had pointed out the lacuna in the act and given directions of the manner in which
the industrial action has to be take on abolition of the contract labour system. The High Court,
therefore, was not right in its direction that the workmen require to be absorbed in the respective
service of the establishment of the appellant. it is also contented that the appellant, though initially
was a statutory Corporation under the IAAI Act, on its abolition and constitution as a company, is
entitled to regulate its own affairs on business principal and the direction for absorption would lead
to further losses in which it is being run. The learned Solicitor General has, therefore, submitted a
scheme under which its subsidiary, namely, Air Cargo Corporation would take the workmen ad
absorb them into service, subject to the above regulation. It has to consider as to how many of the
contract labour require to be absorbed. Prescription of qualification for appointment was necessary;
the principle of reservation adopted by the Central Government requires to be followed; their names
require to be called from Employment Exchange. The workmen should be absorbed o the principle
of "last come first go" subject to their fitness, qualifications and probation etc. Shri K.K. Singhvi and
Mrs. Indira Jai Singh, learned senior counsel and A.K. Gupta, learned counsel for the respondents,
contended that the appellant is an industry carrying on its business of Air Transport Services. Prior
to the IAAI Act, it was under the control of Civil Aviation Department, Government of India; after
the IAAI Act, the appellant has been carrying on its industry by or under the authority of the Central
Government. The relevant provisions in the IAAI Act would establish the deep and pervasive control
the Central Government has over the functions of the appellant. Whether the appellant is an
industry carrying on business by, or under the authority of the Central Government, must be

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/784921/

determined keeping in view the language of the statute that gave birth to the Corporation, and the
nature of functions under the IAAI act and the control the Central Government is exercising over the
working of the industry of the appellant to indicate that right form its inception the appellant has
been carrying on its business, by or under the authority of the Central Government. Rightly
understanding that legal position, the Central Government had referred the matter to the Central
Advisory Board under Section 10(1) of the Act and on the basis of its report had issued the
notification dated December 9,1976 abolishing the contract labour system in the aforestated
services. Therefore, it is valid in law. The Bench in Heavy Engineering case narrowly construed the
meaning of the phrase "the appropriate Government" placing reliance on the common law doctrine
of "principle and agent". The public law interpretation is the appropriate principle of construction of
the phrase "the appropriate Government". In view of internal evidence provided in the IAAI Act ad
the nature of the business carried on by the appellant by or under the control of the Central
Government, the appropriate Government is none other than the Central Government. In particular,
after the development of law of "other authority" or "instrumentality of the State" under Article 12 of
the Constitution, the ratio in Heavy Engineering case is no longer good law. In Hindustan
Aeronautics Ltd. and Food Corp of India cases, this court had not independently, laid any legal
preposition. Food Corporation of India case was considered with reference to the regional
warehouses of the FCI situated in different States and in this functional perspective, this court came
to the conclusion that the appropriate Government would be the State Government.
This Court in Sukhdev Singh & Ors. v. Bhagatram Sardar Singh & Anr. [(1975) 3 SCR 619]; R.D.
Shetty v. Airport Authority & Ors. [(1979) 3 SCR 1014]; Managing Director, U.P. Warehousing
Corporation & Anr. v. V.N. Vajapayee [(1980) 2 SCR 733]; Ajay Hasia etc. v. Khalid Mujib
Sehravardi & Ors. etc. [(1981) 2 SCR 79] - wealth of authorities - had held that settled legal position
would lend aid to interpret the phrase "appropriate Government" in public law interpretation; under
the Act the Central Government is the appropriate Government to take a decision under section 10
of the Act to abolish the contract labour system. It is further contended that the central Government,
after notifying abolition of contract labour system is devoid of power under section 10(1) to appoint
another Advisory Board to Consider whether or not to abolish the same contract labour system in
the aforesaid services in the establishments of the appellant. The recommendation of the Mohile
Committee and the resultant second notification were, therefore, without authority of law. The two
Judge Benches in Dena Nath and Gujarat Electricity Board's cases have not correctly interpreted the
law. After abolition of the contract labour system, if the principle employer omits to abide by the law
and fails to absorb the labour worked in the establishments of the appellant on regular basis, the
workmen have no option but to seek judicial redress under Article 226 of the Constitution. Judicial
Review being the basis feature of the Constitution, the High Court is to have the notification
enforced. The citizen has a fundamental right to seek redressal of their legal injury by judicial
process to enforce his rights in the proceedings under Article 226. The High Court, therefore, was
right to dwell into the question and to give the impugned direction in the judgment. The workmen
have a fundamental right to life. Meaningful right to life springs from continued work to earn their
livelihood. The right to employment, therefore, is an integral facet of right to life. When they were
engaged as contract labour and were continuously working in the establishments of the appellant, to
make their right to social and economic justice meaningful and effective, they are required to be
continuously engaged as contract labour so long as the work is available in the establishment. When

work is of perennial nature and on abolition of contract labour system, they are entitled, per force,
to be absorbed labour system, they are entitled, per force, to be absorbed on regular basis
transposing their erstwhile contractual status into that of an employer - employee relationship so as
to continue to eke out their livelihood by working under the employer and be entitled to receive
salary prescribed to that post. Thereby, they became entitled to be absorbed without ay hiatus with
effect from the date of abolition. If any action is needed to be taken thereafter against the employee,
it should be only in accordance with either the statutory rules or the ID Act, if applicable. In either
event, the right to absorption assures to the workmen the right to livelihood as economic
empowerment, right to social justice and right to dignity of person which are the concomitants of
social democracy. These facets of constitutional rights guaranteed to the workmen as their
Fundamental Rights should be kept in view in interpreting the expression "appropriate Government
enjoined under Section 10(1) of the Act and other regulatory provisions in relation to the
employment of the workmen. Therefore, the view in Dena Nath's case is not correct is law and
requires to be overruled.
There is no hiatus in the operation of the Act on abolition of the contract labour system under
Section 10. The object and purpose of the Act are twofold. As long as the work in an industry is not
perennial, the Act regulates the conditions of the workmen employed through the contractor
registered under the Act. The services of the workmen are channelised through the contractor. The
principle employer is required to submit the number of workmen needed for employment in its
establishment who are supplied by the contractor, an intermediary; but the primary responsibility
lies upon the principle employer to abide by law; the violation thereof visits with penal
consequences. The Act regulates systematic operation. Wages to the contract labour should be paid
under the direct supervision of the principle employer. The principle employer is enjoined to compel
the contractor to pay over the wages and on his failure, the principle employer should pay and
recover it from the contractor/intermediary. The principle employer alone is required to provide
safety, health and other amenities to ensure health and safe working conditions in the establishment
of the principle employer. This would clearly indicate the pervasive control the principle employer
has over the contract labour employed through intermediary and regulation of the work by the
workmen during the period of service. On advice by the Board that the work is of perennial nature
etc, and on being satisfied of the conditions specified under Section 10(2), the appropriate
Government takes a decision to abolish the contract labour and have the decision published by a
notification. It results in abolition of the contract labour. Consequently, the linkage of
intermediary/contractor is removed from the operational structure under the Act. It creates direct
connection between the principle employer and the workmen. There is no escape route for the
principle employer to avoid workmen because it needs their services and the workmen are not
meant to be kept in the lurch. The words "principal employer" do indicate that the
intermediary/contractor is merely a supplier of labour to the principal employer. On effacement of
the contractor by abolition of the contract labour system, a direct relationship between the principal
employer and the workmen stands knitted. Thereby the workman becomes an employee of the
principal employer and it relates back to the date of engagement as a contract labour. The details of
the workmen, the requirement of the work force, duration of the work etc, are regulated under the
Act and the Rules. The Act, the Rules and statutory forms do furnish internal and unimpeachable
evidence obviating the need to have industrial adjudication; much less there arises any dispute.

There is no machinery for workmen under the ID Act to seek any industrial adjudication. if any
industrial adjudication is to be sought, it would be only by a recognised union in the establishment
of the appellants who are unlikely to espouse their dispute. Therefore, the methodology suggested in
Gujarat Electricity Board's case, by another bench of two Judges, apart from being unworkable and
incongruous, is not correct in law. On abolition of the contract labour, the principle employer is left
with no right but duty to enforce the notification, absorb the workmen working in the establishment
on contract basis transposing them as its regular employee with all consequential rights and duties
attached to a post on which the workmen working directly under the appellant was entitled or liable.
The Act gave no option to pick and choose the employees at the whim of the principal employer. The
view of the High Court, therefore, is correct to the extent that the notification should be enforced
with effect from date of abolition, namely, December 9,1976. The subsequent amendment with effect
from January 28,1986 is only a recognition of ad superimposition of preexisting legal responsibility
of the Central Government as the appropriate Government. It does not come into being only from
the date the amendment came into force. Consequently, the workmen, namely, the members of the
respondent-Union must be declared to be the employees with effect from the respective dates on
which they were discharging their duties in the respective services of the appellant's establishment
either as Sweeper, Duster, Cleaner, Watchman etc. The view, therefore, of the High Court to the
extent that they should be absorbed with effect from the date of the judgment of the learned single
Judge, is not correct in law. Therefore, to do complete justice, direction may be given to absorb the
workmen with effect from the date abolition, i.e. December 9, 1976 under Article 142 of the
Constitution.
The respective contentions would give rise to the following questions:
1. What is the meaning of the word "appropriate Government under Section 2(1) (a)
of the Act,
2. Whether the view taken in Heavy Engineering case is correct in law?
3. Whether on abolition the contract labour are entitled to be absorbed; if so, from
what date ?
4. Whether the High Court under Article 226 has power to direct their absorption; if
so, from what date ?
5. Whether it is necessary to make a reference under Section 10 of the ID Act for
adjudication of dispute qua absorption of the contract labour?
6. Whether the view taken by this Court in Dena Nath and Gujarat State Electricity
Board's case is correct in law ?
7. Whether the workmen have got a right for absorption and, if so, what is the remedy
for enforcement ?

Section 2 (1) (a) of the Act defines "appropriate Government" to mean-
""(1) in relation to an establishment in respect of which the appropriate Government under the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (Act 14 of 1947), is the Central Government, the Central Government;
""(2) in relation to any other establishment, the Government of the State in which that other
establishment is situated."
Prior to the Amendment Act 14 of 1986, the definition was as under :
"2 (1) (a) "Appropriate Government"
means-
(1) in relation to -
(i) any establishment pertaining to any industry carried on by or under the authority
of the Central Government, or pertaining to any such controlled industry as may be
specified in this behalf by the Central Government, or
(ii) any establishment of any railway, Cantonment Board, Major port, mine or
oil-field, or
(iii) any establishment of a banking or insurance company, the Central Government,
(2) in relation to any other establishment the Government of the State in which that
other establishment is situate."
Section 2(a)(i) of the ID Act defines "appropriate Government" thus :"... Unless there is anything
repugnant in the subject or context, "appropriate Government" means, in relation to any Industrial
Disputes concerning any industry carried on by or under the authority of the Central Government or
by a railway company for concerning any such controlled industry as may be specified in this behalf
by the Central Government..." and India Airlines and Air India Corporation established under
Section 3 of the Air Corporation Act 1953 are enumerated industries under Amendment Act 46 of
1982 which came into force with effect from 21.8.1984.
In Heavy Engineering case (supra), industrial dispute was referred under Section 10 of the ID Act by
the State Government of Bihar to the Industrial Tribunal for its adjudication. The competency of the
State Government was questioned by the Mazdoor Union contending that the appropriate
government to refer the dispute was the Central government. The High Court negatived the
contention and had upheld the validity of reference, On appeal, a Bench of two Judges had held that
the words "under authority of" means pursuant to the authority, such as an agent or a servant's acts
under or pursuant to the authority of its principal or master. The Heavy Engineering Company
cannot be said to be carrying on its business pursuant to the authority of the Central Government.
Placing reliance on common law interpretation, the Bench was of the opinion that the company
Air India Statutory Corporation vs United Labour Union & Ors on 6 November, 1996
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/784921/
8
derived its powers and functions from its Memorandum ad Articles of Association. Though the
entire share capital was contributed by the Central Government and all the shares were held by the
President and officers of the Central Government were in-charge of the management, it did not
make any difference. The company and the share holders are distinct entities. The fact that the
President of India and certain officers hold all its shares did not make the company an agent either
of the President or of the Central Government. The power to decide how the company should
function ; the power to appoint Directors and the power to determine the wages all salaries payable
by the company to its employees, were all derived form the Memorandum of company and Articles
of Association of the Company and not by the reason of the Company being the agent of the Central
Government. The learned judges came to that conclusion on the basic of concessions and on private
law of principal and agent and as regards a company registered under the Companies Act, on the
basic of the power of internal management. In Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. case (supra), learned
judges merely followed the ratio of Heavy Engineering case. It further concluded that the
enumeration of certain statutory Corporations in the definition would indicate that those
enumerated Corporations would come within the definition of the "appropriate Government"
without any further discussion. In Rashtriya Mill Mazdoor Sangh's case, a Bench of
three judges, while interpreting Section 32 (iv) of the Payment of Bonus Act,
considered the purpose of the expression "under the authority of any department of
the Central Government for purpose of payment of bonus". The meaning and scope of
the expression "industry carried on by or under the authority of any department of
the Central Government", was examined and it was held that the industrial
undertaking retains its identity, personality and status unchanged though in its
management, the Central Government exercised the power to give a direction under
section 16 and the management is subjected to regulatory control. It is seen that the
above decision was reached in the context in which the payment of bonus was to be
determined and paid to the employees by the department. In Food Corporation of
India's case (supra), a Bench of two Judges was to consider whether regional office of
the Food Corporation of India and the warehouses etc. were an "establishment"
within the meaning of Section 2(i)(e) of the Act and whether FCI is an industry
carried on by or under the authority of the Central Government. Following the
aforesaid three decisions, it was held that a bare reading of the definition under the
Act means inter alia any place, any industry, trade, business, manufacture,
warehouse, godown or the place set up by the corporation where its business is
carried on. Though for the purpose of industrial disputes the Central Government is
an appropriate Government in relation to Food Corporation of India, its
establishment at various places is not under the control of the Government of India.
Therefore, appropriate Government under the Industrial Disputes Act is the state
Government. In that behalf, the learned Judges, undoubtedly, relied upon Heavy
Engineering case. It would thus be seen that the construction adopted on the phrase
"appropriate Government"
under the ID Act was considered with reference to its functional efficacy. The Heavy Engineering
case, as held earlier, had proceeded on common law principles and the concession by the counsel.

As noted, the appellant, to start with, was a statutory authority but pending appeal in this court, due
to change in law and in order to be in tune with open economy, it became a company registered
under the Companies Act. To consider its sweep on the effect of Heavy Engineering case on the
interpretation of the phrase 'appropriate Government', it would be necessary to recapitulate the
Preamble, Fundamental Rights (Part III) and Directive Principle (Part IV) - trinity setting out the
conscience of the Constitution deriving from the source "We, the people", a charter to establish an
egalitarian social order in which social and economic justice with dignity of person and equality of
status and opportunity, are assured to every citizen in a socialist democratic Bharat Republic. The
Constitution, the Supreme law heralds to achieve the above goals under the rule of law. Life of law is
not logic but is one of experience, Constitution provides an enduring instrument, designed to meet
the changing needs of each succeeding generation altering and adjusting the unequal conditions to
pave way for social and economic democracy within the spirit drawn from the Constitution. So too,
the legal redressal within the said parameters. The words in the Constitution or in an Act are but a
framework of the concept which may change more than words themselves consistent with the march
of law. Constitutional issues require interpretation broadly not by play of words or without the
acceptance of the line of their growth, Preamble of the Constitution, as its integral part, is people
including workmen, harmoniously blending the details enumerated in the Fundamental Rights and
the Directive Principles. The Act is a social welfare measure to further the general interest of the
community of workmen as opposed to the particular interest of the individual enterpreneur. It seeks
to achieve a public purpose, i.e., regulated conditions of contract labour and to abolish it when it is
found to be of perennial nature etc. The individual interest can, therefore, no longer stem the
forward flowing tide and must, of necessity, give way to the broader public purpose of establishing
social and economic democracy in which every workmen realises socio- economic justice assured in
the preamble, Articles 14,15 and 21 and the Directive Principles of the Constitution.
The founding fathers of the Constitution, cognizant of the reality of life wisely engrafted the
Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles in Chapters III and IV for a democratic way of life to
every one in Bharat Republic, the State under Article 38 is enjoined strive to promote the welfare of
the people by securing and protecting as effectively as it may, a social order in which justice, social,
economic and political shall inform all the institutions of the national life and to minimise the
inequalities in income and endeavour to eliminate the inequalities in status, facilities and
opportunities, not only amongst individuals but also amongst groups of people residing in different
areas or engaged in different vocations, Article 39(a) provides that the State shall direct its policies
towards securing the citizens, men and women equally, the right to an adequate means of livelihood;
clause (d) provides for equal pay for equal work for both men and women; clause (e) provides to
secure the health and strength of workers. Articles 41 provides that within the limits of its economic
capacity and development, the state shall make effective provision to secure the right to work as
fundamental with just and human conditions of work by suitable legislation or economic
organisation or in any other way in which the worker shall be assured of living wages, conditions of
work ensuring a decent standard of life and full enjoyment of leisure and social and cultural
opportunities to the workmen. The poor, the workman and common man can secure and realise
economic and social freedom only through the right to work and right to adequate means of
livelihood, to just and human conditions of work, to a living wage, a decent standard of life.
education and leisure. To them, these are fundamental facets of life. Article 43A, brought by 42nd
Air India Statutory Corporation vs United Labour Union & Ors on 6 November, 1996
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/784921/
10
Constitution (Amendment) Act, 1976 enjoins upon the State to secure by suitable legislation or in
any other way, the participation of workers in the management of undertakings, establishments or
other organisations engaged in any industry. Article 46 gives a positive mandate to promote
economic and educational interest of the weaker sections of the people. Correspondingly, Article 51A
imposes fundamental duties on every citizen to develop the scientific temper, humanism and to
strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity, so that the nation
constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement. To make these rights meaningful to
workmen and meaningful right to life a reality to workmen, shift of judicial orientation from private
law principles to public law interpretation harmoniously fusing the interest of the community.
Article 39A furnishes beacon light that justice be done on the basis of equal opportunity and no one
be denied justice by reason of economic or other disabilities. Courts are sentinal in the quivive of the
rights of the people, in particular the poor. The judicial function of a Court, therefore, in interpreting
the Constitution and the provisions of the Act, requires to build up continuity of socio-economic
empowerment to the poor to sustain equality of opportunity and status and the law should
constantly meet the needs and aspiration of the society in establishing the egalitarian of the society
in establishing the egalitarian social order. Therefore, the concepts engrafted in the statute require
interpretation from that perspectives, without doing violence to the language. Such an
interpretation would elongate the spirit and purpose of the Constitution and make the aforesaid
rights to the workmen a reality lest establishment of an egalitarian social order would be frustrated
and Constitutional goal defeated.
Keeping this broad spectrum in view, let us consider whether the interpretation given in Heavy
Engineering case is consistent with the scheme and spirit of the Constitution. In Rajasthan State
Electricity Board, Jaipur v. Mohan Lal & Ors. [(1967) 3 SCR 377, a Constitution Bench, composing
the learned judges who formed the Bench in Heavy Engineering case, considered the issue
interpretation and Bhargava, J. speaking on behalf of the majority, had held that "other authority"
within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution need no necessarily be an authority to perform
governmental functions. The expression 'other authority' is wide enough to include within it every
authority created by a statute on which powers are conferred to carry out governmental functions or
the "functions under the control of the Government". It is not necessary that some of powers
conferred be Governmental sovereign function to carry on commercial activities. Since the State is
empowered under Articles 19 (1) (g) and 298 to carry on any trade or business, it was held that
Rajasthan State Electricity Board was "other authority" under Article 12 of the Constitution. The
significance of the observation is that an authority under the control of the State need not carry on
Governmental functions. It can carry on commercial activities. At this juncture, it is relevant keep at
the back of our mind, which was not brought to the attention of the Bench which decided Heavy
Engineering case, that Article 19(2) of the Constitution grants to the State, by clause
(ii) thereof, monopoly to carry on, by the State or by a Corporation owned or controlled by the State,
any trade, business, industry or service whether to the execlusion, complete or partial, of citizens or
otherwise. The narrow interpretation strips the State of its monopolistic power to exclude citizens
from the field of any activity, to carry on any trade, business, industry or service, total or partial. A
reverse trend which would deflect the constitutional perspective was set in motion by the same
Bench in Praga tools Corporation v. C.V. Imanual [(1969) 3 SCR 773] decided on February
Air India Statutory Corporation vs United Labour Union & Ors on 6 November, 1996

19,1969,24 days prior to the date of decision in Heavy Engineering case; in which it was held in main
that writ under Article 226 would not lie against a company incorporated under Companies Act and
the declaration that dismissal of the workmen was illegal, given by the High Court was set aside. But
the operation of the above ratio was put to stop by the Constitution Bench decision in Sukhdev
Singh & Ors. v. Bhagat Ram & Anr. [(1975) 3 SCR 619]. In that behalf, the interpretation given by
Mathew, J. in a separate but concurrent judgment is of vital significance taking away the State
action from the clutches of moribund common law jurisprudence; it set on foot forward march
under public law interpretation. Mathew, J. had held that the concept of State had undergone
drastic change. It cannot be conceived of simply as a cohesive machinery yielding the thunderbolt of
authority. The State is a service Corporation. It acts only thorough its instrumentalities or agencies
of natural and juridical person. There is a distinction between State action and private action. There
is nothing strange in the notion of the State acting through a Corporation and making it an agency
or instrumentality of the State with an advent of the welfare State. The framework of the civil service
administration became increasingly insufficient for handling new tasks which were often of a
specialised and highly technical character. Development of policy of public administration, through
separate Corporations which would operate largely according to business principles and separately
accountable though under the Memorandum of Association or Articles of Association become the
arm of the Government. Though their employees are not civil servants, it being a public authority
and State Corporation, therefore, is subject to control of the Government. The public corporation,
being a corporation of the State, is subject to the constitutional limitation as the State itself. The
governing power, wherever located, must be subject to the fundamental constitutional limitations.
The Court, therefore, had laid the test to see whether the Corporation is an agency or
instrumentality of the Government to carry on business for the benefit of public. Thus, the ratio in
Praga Tools case, no writ would lie against the Corporation is not a statutory body, as it is not a
authority, it is an instrumentality of the State.
In R.D. Shetty v. International Airport Authority of India & Ors. [(1979) 3 SCR 1014], this Court had
held that due to expansion of welfare and social service functions, the State increasingly controls
material and economical resources in the society involving large scale industrial and commercial
activities with their executive functions affecting the lives of the people. It regulates and dispenses
special services and provides large number of benefits. When the Government deals with the public,
it cannot act arbitrarily. Where a corporation is an instrumentality or agency of the Government, it
would be subject to the same constitutional or public law limitation as the Government. The
limitations of the action by the Government must apply equally when such action are dealt with by
Corporation having instrumentality element with public and they cannot act arbitrarily, Such a
functioning cannot enter into relationship with any person it likes at its sweet will. Its action must
be in conformity with some principle which meets the test of reason and relevance. Therefore, the
distinction between a statutory corporation and the company incorporated under the Companies
Act was obliterated.
In Managing Director, U.P. Warehousing Corpn. v. V.N. Vajpayee [(1980) 2 SCR 773], Chinnappa
Reddy, J. in this separate but concurrent judgment laid down the relevant principles. The
Government establishes and manges large number of industries and institutions which have become
biggest employer and there is no good reason why the Government should not be bound to observe
Air India Statutory Corporation vs United Labour Union & Ors on 6 November, 1996
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/784921/
12
the equality clause of the Constitution in a matter of employment and its dealings with its
employees; why the Corporation set up or owned by the Government would not equally be bound
and why instead such Corporation would become citadels of patronage and arbitrary action. Such a
distinction perhaps would mock at the Constitution and the people; some element of public
employment is all that is necessary to take the employee beyond the reach of rule which denies him
the protection of Articles 14 and 16. Independence and integrity of the employees in the public
sector should be secured as much as the independence and integrity of the Civil servants. it was,
therefore, held that a writ would lie against the warehousing corporation.
In Ajay Hasia etc. v. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. etc. [(1961) 2 SCR 79], a Constitution Bench
was to consider whether a Society registered under the J & K Societies Registration Act would be a
State under Article 12 of the Constitution amenable to the reach of the writ jurisdiction. The
Constitution Bench laid the following tests to determine whether the entity is an instrumentality or
agency of the State : (1) if the entire share capital of the corporation is held by the Government, it
would go a long way towards indicating that the corporation is an instrumentality or agency or
Government ; (2) where the financial assistance of the State is so much as to meet almost entire
expenditure of the corporation being impregnated with governmental character; (3) it must also be
relevant factor whether the corporation enjoys monopoly status which is State conferred of State
protected; (4) existence of deep and pervasive State control may afford an indication that the
corporation is a State agency or instrumentality (5) if the functions of the corporation are of public
importance and closely related to governmental functions, it would be a relevant factor in classifying
the corporation as a instrumentality or agency of Government ; (6) specifically, if a department of
Government is transferred to a corporation, it would be a strong factor supportive of the inference of
the corporation being an instrumentality or agency of Government. In Delhi Transport Corporation
v. D.T.C. Mazdoor Corpn.[AIR 1991 SC 101], it was held that the State has a deep and pervasive
control over the functioning of the society and, therefore, is an agency of the state. In Som Prakash
Rekhi v. Union of India & Ors. [(1981) 2 SCR 111], it was held that the settled position in law is that
any authority under the control of the Government of India comes within the definition of a State.
Burmashell oil Co, was held to be an instrumentality of the State though it was a Government
company. The authority in administrative law is a body having jurisdiction in certain matters of
public nature. Therefore, the ability conferred upon a person by a law is to alter his case own will
directed to that end. The rights; duties and liabilities or other legal relations, either of himself or
other person must be present to make a person an authority. When the person is an agent or
functions on behalf of the State, as an instrumentality, the exericse of the power is public.
Sometimes, the test id formulated by asking whether corporation was formed by or under the
statute. The true test is not how it is founded in legal personality but when it is created, apart from
discharging public function or doing business as the proxy of the State, whether there is an element
of ability in it to effect the relations by virtue of power vested in it by law. In that case, it was held
that the above tests were satisfied and the company was directed to pay full pension.
In Manmohan Singh Jaitla v. Commissioner. Union Territory of Chandigarh & Ors. [(1984) supp.
SCC 540], it was held that an educational institution receiving 952 of the grant-in-aid from the
Government is "other authority"
Air India Statutory Corporation vs United Labour Union & Ors on 6 November, 1996
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/784921/
13
under Article 12 of the Constitution. It was, therefore, held that the termination of the
service without enquiry was without jurisdiction. Dismissal from service without
enquiry was declared illegal under Article 226. In P.K. Ramachandra Iyer & Ors. v.
Union of India & Ors. [(1984) 2 SCC 141], ICAR, a Society registered under the
Societies Registration Act, was held an adjunct of the Government of India. Its
budged was voted as part of the budget of the Ministry of Agriculture. It was held that
it was the State under Article 12 and was amenable to jurisdiction under Article 32 of
the Constitution. The Project and Equipment Corporation of India which is
subsidiary owned by State Trading Corporation was held by this Court in A.L. Kalra v.
Project and Equipment Corpn. of India Ltd. [(1984) 3 SCR 316], to be an agency of
the Government within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India. In
Central Inland Water Transport Corpn. Ltd. & Anr. v. Brojonath Ganguly & Anr.
[(1986) 3 SCR 156], a Government Company incorporated under Companies Act was
held to be an instrumentality or agency. In this case, this court construed the
Fundamental rights under Articles 14 to 17, the Director Principle under Article 38,41
and 42, the Preamble of the Constitution and held that the River Steam Navigation
Co. Ltd, was carrying on the same business as the corporation was doing. A scheme of
arrangement was entered into between the corporation and the company. They were
managed by the board of Directors appointed and removable by the Central
Government. It was, therefore, held that it was an agency or instrumentality of the
State under Article 12. In that behalf this court pointed out that the trade of business
activity of the State constitutes public enterprise; the structural forms in which the
Government operates in the field of public enterprises are many and varied. They
may consist of governmental department, statutory body, statutory corporation of
government companies etc.; immunities and privileges possessed by bodies so set up
by the Government under Article 298 are subject to Fundamental Rights and
Directive Principles to further the State policy. For the purpose of Article 12, the
Court must see necessarily through corporate veil to ascertain behind the veil the face
of instrumentality or agency of the State has assumed the garb of a governmental
company, as defined in Section 3(7) of the Companies Act, it does not follow thereby
that it ceases to be an instrumentality or agency of the State. Applying the above test,
it was held that Inland Water Transport Corporation was State.
When its correctness was doubted and its reference to the Constitution Bench was
made in Delhi Transport Corpn. case (supra), while holding that Delhi Road
Transport Authority was an instrumentality of the State, it was held that employment
is not a bounty from the State nor can it survival be at their mercy. Income is the
Foundation of any Fundamental Rights. Work is the sole source of income. The right
to work become as much fundamental as right to life. Law as a social machinery
requires to remove the existing imbalances and to further the progress serving the
needs of the Socialist Democratic Republic under the rule of law. Prevailing social
conditions and actualities of the life are to be taken into account to adjudge the
dispute and to see whether the interpretation would submerge the purpose of the
Society.

In Lucknow Development Authority v. M.K. Gupta [(1984) 1 SCC 243], the question
was whether a Government Authority is amenable to the regulation of Consumer
Protection Act. It was held in paragraph 5 and 6 that a Government or a semi-
Government body or local authority are amenable to the Act as much as any other
private body rendering similar service. This is a service to the society and they are
amenable to public accountability for health and growth of society, housing
construction or building activities, by private or statutory body rendering service
within the meaning of Section 2(0) of the said Act. In Star Enterprises & Ors. v.
C.I.D.C. of Maharashtra Ltd. [(1990) 3 SCR 280], it was held that the State or its
instrumentality entering into commercial field must act in consonance with the rule
of law. In paragraph 10, it was held the judicial review of administrative action has
become expansive and its scope is becoming wider day by day. The traditional
limitations have been vanishing and the sphere of judicial scrutiny is being expanded,
State activity too is becoming fast perversive as the State has descended into the
commercial field and joint public sector undertaking has grown up. The State action
must be justified by judicial review, by opening up of the public law interpretation.
Accordingly, it was held that the action of company registered under the Companies
Act was amenable to judicial review.
In LIC of India & Anr. v. Consumer Eduction & Research Centre & Ors. [(1995) 5 SCC
482], it was held that in the contractual field of State action, the State must act justly,
fairly and reasonably in public interest commensurate with the constitutional
conscience and socio- economic justice; insurance policies of LIC, terms and
conditions prescribed therein involve public element. It was. therefore, held in para
23 at page 498 that every action of the public authority or the person acting in public
interest or any act that gives rise to public element, should be guided by public power
or action hedged with public element that becomes open to challenge. If it is shown
that the exercise of the power is arbitrary, unjust and unfair, it should be no answer
for the State, its instrumentality, public authority or person whose acts have the
insignia of public element, to say that their actions are in the field of private law and
they are free to prescribe any conditions or limitations in their actions. They must be
based on some rational and relevant principles. It must not be guided by irrational or
irrelevant considerations. Every administrative decision must be hedged by reasons.
At page 501 in para 28 it was held that though the dispute may fall within the domain
of contractual obligation, it would not relieve the State etc, of its obligation to comply
with the basic requirements of Article
14. To this extent, the obligation is of public character, invariably in every case,
irrespective of there being any other right or obligation. An additional contractual
obligation cannot divest the claimant of the guarantee under Article 14 of
non-arbitrariness at the hands of the State etc, in any of its actions.
In G.B. Mahajan & Ors. v. Jalgaon Municipal Council & Ors. [(1991) 3 SCC 91 at 109,
para 38], it was held that in interpretation of the test of reasonableness in
Air India Statutory Corporation vs United Labour Union & Ors on 6 November, 1996
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/784921/
15
Administrative law, the words "void" and "voidable" found in private law area are
amenable to public law situations and "carry over with them meanings that may be
inapposite in the changed context. Some such thing has happened to the words
'reasonable' or reasonableness etc." In Shrisht Dhawan (Smt.) v. M/s. Shaw Brothers
[(1992) 1 SCC 534 at 553, para 20] the private law principle of fraud and collusion in
section 17 of the Contract Act was applied to public law remedy and it was held "that
fraud in public law is not the same as fraud in private law. Nor can the ingredient,
which has established fraud and commercial transaction be of assistance in
determining fraud in administrative law. It has been aptly observed in Khwaja vs.
Secretary of State for the Home Department & Ors. [(1983) 1 All. E.R. 765] that it is
dangerous to introduce maxims of common law as to the effect of fraud while
determining fraud in relation to the statutory law". In Khwaja's case (supra), it was
held "despite the wealth of authority on the subject, there is nowhere to be found in
the relevant judgments (perhaps because none was thought necessary) a definitive
exposition of the reasons why a person who has obtained leave to enter by fraud is an
illegal entrant. To say that the fraud 'vitiates' the leave or that the leave is not 'in
accordance with the Act' is, with respect, to state a conclusion without explaining the
steps by which it is reached. Since we are here concerned with purely statutory law, I
think there are dangers in introducing maxims of the common law as to the effect of
fraud on common law transaction and still greater dangers in seeking to apply the
concepts of 'void and voidable'. In a number of recent cases in your Lordships' House,
it has been pointed out that these transplants from the field of contract do not readily
take root in the field of public law. This is well illustrated in the judgement of the
Court of Appeal in the instant case of Khawaja [1982] 1 WLR 625 at 630; of [1982] 2
All ER 523, at 527, where Donaldson LJ spoke of the appellant's leave to enter as
being 'voidable ab initio', which I find, with respect, an impossibly difficult legal
category to comprehend". Thus, the limitations in private law were lifted and public
law interpretation of fraud was enlarged.
It must be remembered that the Constitution adopted mixed economy and control
over the industry in its establishment, working and production of goods and services.
After recent liberalised free economy private and multi- national entrepreneurship
has gained ascendancy and entrenched into wider commercial production and
services, domestic consumption goods and large scale industrial productions. Even
some of the public Corporation are thrown open to the private national and
multi-national investments. It is axiomatic, whether or not industry is controlled by
Government or public Corporations by statutory form or administrative clutch or
private agents, juristic persons, Corporation whole or corporation sole, their
constitution, control and working would also be subject to the same constitutional
limitation in the trinity, viz., Preamble, the Fundamental Rights and the Directive
Principles. They throw open an element of public interest in its working. They share
the burden and shoulder constitutional obligations to provide facilities and
opportunities enjoined in the Directive Principles, the Preamble and the fundamental
rights enshrined in the Constitution. The word 'control', therefore, requires to be

interpreted in the changing commercial scenario broadly in keeping with the
aforesaid constitutional goals and perspectives.
From the above discussion, the following principles would emerge:
[1] The constitution of the Corporation or instrumentality or agency or corporation
aggregate or Corporation sole is not of sole material relevance to decide whether it is
by or under the control of the appropriate Government under the Act.
[2] If it is a statutory Corporation, it is an instrumentality or agency of the State. If it
is a company owned wholly or partially by a share capital, floated from public
exchequer, it gives indicia that it is controlled by or under the authority of the
appropriate Government.
[3] In commercial activities carried on by a Corporation established by or under the
control of the appropriate Government having protection under Articles 14 and 19
[2], it is an instrumentality or agency of the State. [4] The State is a service
Corporation. It acts through its instrumentalities, agencies or persons natural or
juridical.
[5] The governing power, wherever located, must be subject to the fundamental
constitutional limitations and abide by the principles laid in the Directive Principles.
[6] The framework of service regulations made in the appropriate rules or regulations
should be consistent with and subject to the same public law principles and
limitations.
[7] Though the instrumentality, agency or person conducts commercial activities
according to business principles and are separately accountable under their
appropriate bye-laws or Memorandum of Association, they become the arm of the
Government.
[8] The existence of deep and pervasive State control depends upon the facts and
circumstances in a given situation and in the altered situation it is not the sole
criterion to decide whether the agency or instrumentality or persons is by or under
the control of the appropriate Government.
[9] Functions of an instrumentality, agency or person are of public importance
following public interest element. [10] The instrumentality, agency or person must
have an element of authority or ability to effect the relations with its employees or
public by virtue of power vested in it by law, memorandum of association or bye-laws
or articles of association.
[11] The instrumentality, agency or person renders an element of public service and is
accountable to health and strength of the workers men and women, adequate means

of livelihood, the security for payment of living wages, reasonable conditions of word,
decent standard of life and opportunity to enjoy full leisure and social and cultural
activities to the workmen. [12] Every action of the public authority, agency or
instrumentality or the person acting in public interest or any act that gives rise to
public element should be guided by public interest in exercise of public power or
action hedged with public element and is open to challenge. It must meet the test of
reasonableness, fairness and justness.
[13] If the exercise of the power is arbitrary, unjust and unfair, and public authority,
instrumentality, agency or the person acting in public interest, though in the field of
private law, is not free to prescribe any unconstitutional conditions or limitations in
their actions.
It must be based on some rational and relevant principles. It must not be guided by
irrational or irrelevant considerations and all their actions ****** satisfy the basic law
requirements of Article 14. The public law interpretation is the basic tools of
interpretation in that behalf relegating common law principles to purely private law
field.
From this perspective and on deeper consideration, we are of the considered view
that the two-judge Bench in Heavy Engineering case narrowly interpreted the words
"appropriate Government" on the common law principles which no longer bear any
relevance when it is tested on the anvil of Article
14. It is true that in Hindustan Machine Tool's R.D. Shetty's and Food Corporation of
India cases the ratio of Heavy Engineering case formed the foundation. In Hindustan
Machine Tool's case, there was no independent consideration except repetition and
approval of the ratio in Heavy Engineering case. It is to reiterate that Heavy
Engineering case is based on concession. In R.B. Shetty's case, the need to dwelve
indepth into this aspect did not arise but reference was make to the premise of
private law interpretation which was relegated to and had given place to
constitutional perspectives of Article 14 which is consistent with the view we have
stated above. In Food Corporation of India's case, the Bench proceeded primarily on
the within the jurisdiction of different State Governments which led it to conclude
that the appropriate Government would be the State Government.
In the light of the above principles and discussions, we have no hesitation to hold that the
appropriate Government is the Central Government from the inception of the Act. The notification
published under Section 10 on December 9,1976, therefore, was in exercise of its power as
appropriate Government. So it is valid in law. The learned Solicitor General is not right in
contending that the relevant factors for abolition of the contract labour system in the establishment
of the appellant was not before the Central Advisory Board before its recommendation to abolish the
contact labour system in the establishment of the appellant. The learned Attorney General has
placed before us the minutes of the Board which do show the unmistakable material furnished do

18
indicated that the work in all the establishments including those of the appellants, is of perennial
nature satisfying all the tests engrafted in Section 10(2) of the Act. Accordingly, on finding the work
to be of perennial nature, it had recommended and the Central Government had considered and
accepted the recommendation to abolish the contract labour system in the aforesaid services.
Having abolished it, the Central Government was denuded of its power under Section 10(1) to again
appoint insofar as the above services of the Mohile Committee to go once over into the self-same
question and the recommendation s of the latter not to abolish the contract labour system in the
above services and the acceptance thereof by the Central Government are without any legal base
and, therefore, non est. The next crucial question for consideration is: whether the High Court was
right in directing enforcement of the notification dated December 9,1976 issued by the Central
Government ? Before adverting to that aspect, it is necessary to consider the relevant provisions of
the Act.
The Constitutionality of the Act was challenged in M/s. Gammon India Ltd. & Ors. v. Union of India
& Ors. [(1974) 1 SCC 596] on the touchstone of the Fundamental Rights given by Articles 14.15,19(1)
(g) and of Article 265. The Constitution Bench elaborately considered the provisions of the Act and
had held that the Act in Section 10 empower the Government to prohibit employment of contract
labour. The Government, under that Section, has to apply its mind to various factors, before
publishing the notification in the official Gazette prohibiting employment of contract labour in any
process, operation or other work in any establishment. The words " other work in any
establishment"
were held to be important. The work in the establishment will be apparent from
Section 10 (2) of the Act as incidental or necessary to the industry, trade, business,
manufacture or occupation that is carried on in the establishment. The Government
before notifying prohibition of contract labour work which is carried on in the
establishment, will consider whether the work is of a perennial nature in that
establishment or work is done ordinarily through regular workmen in that
establishment. The words "work of an establishment" which are used in defining
workmen as contract labour being employed in connected with the work of an
establishment indicate that the work of the establishment there is the same as word
in the establishment contemplated by Section 10 of the Act. The contractor under
takes to produce a given result for the establishment through contract labour. He
supplies contract labour for any work of the establishment. The entire site is the
establishment and belongs to the principal employer who has a right of supervision
and control; he is the owner of the premises and the end product and from whom the
contract labour receives its payment either directly or through a contractor. It is the
place where the establishment intends to carry on its business, trade, industry,
manufacture, occupation after the construction is complete. Accordingly, the
constutionality of the Act was upheld.
The appalling conditions of contract labour who are victims of exploitation have been
engaging the attention of various committees for a long tie and in furtherance of the
recommendations, the Act was enacted to benefit, as a welfare measures, viz.,
Air India Statutory Corporation vs United Labour Union & Ors on 6 November, 1996
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/784921/
19
provisions for canteens rest room, facilities for supply of drinking water, latrines,
urinals, first aid facilities and amenities for the dignity of human labour, are in larger
interests of the community. Legislature is the best judge to determine what is needed
as the appropriate condition for employment of contract labour. The legislature is
guided by the needs of the general public in determining the reasonableness of such
requirements under the Act and the rules made thereunder. Suffice it would, for the
purpose of this case, to concentrate on the definition of "contract labour" under
Section 2(b), "contractor" under Section 2(c), "establishment" under Section 2(e),
"principal employer"
under Section 2 (g), "wages" under Section 2 (h) and of "workman" under Section 2 (i) Under
Section 2 (c), "contractor" in relation to an establishment, means a person who undertakes to
produce a given result for the establishment, other than a mere supply of goods or articles of
manufacture to such establishment, through contract labour of who supples contract labour for any
work of the establishment and includes a sub-contractor.
"Establishment", under Section 2(e), means any office of department of government
of a local authority, or any place where any industry, trade, business, manufacture or
occupation is carried on. "Principal employer", under Section 2(g), means, in relation
to any office or department of the Government or a local authority, as the case may be
may specify in this behalf; and in a factory, it means the owner or occupier of the
factory and where a person has been named as the manager of the factory under the
Factories Act, 1948, the person so named; in a mine, it means the owner or agent of
the mine and where a person has been named as the manager of the mine, the person
so named; and in any other establishment, any person responsible for the supervision
and control of the establishment, is the principal employer. "Workman", under
Section 2 (i), means any person employed in or in connection with the work of any
establishment to do any skilled, semi-skilled or unskilled, manual, supervisory,
technical or clerical work for hire or reward, whether the terms of employment be
express or implied, but does not include any such person categorised in clauses (a) to
(e) which are not relevant for the purpose of this case.
Every principal employer of an establishment under the Act is enjoined under Section
7 to apply for registration and have it registered thereunder. The registration is
subject to the revocation under Section 8 on fulfilment of certain conditions
enumerated therein. The effect of non- registration is enumerated in Section 9 in the
mandatory language that no principal employer shall employ contract labour in the
establishment af ter the specified period. Section 12 enjoins similar obligations on the
contractor for registration, with mandatory language, that from the appropriate date,
no contractor to whom the Act applies, hall undertake or execute any work through
contract labour except under and in accordance with the licence issued in that behalf
by the licensing officer.

20
Licence is grated under Section 13 and revocation, suspension and amendment
thereof have been provided, in Section 14 with which we are not concerned in this
case. The welfare measures mandated in Chapter V be complied with by every
establishment. Under Section 21, every principal employer shall nominate his
representative to be present at the time of disbursement of wages by the contractor
and the contractor should be responsible for payment of wages to every such
workman. Representative of the principal employer should ensure and certify that
wages was paid in the prescribed manner. In case of default committed by the
contractor in paying wages within the prescribed period or for short payment , the
principal employer period or for short payment of wages in full or the unpaid balance
due, as the case may be, to the contract labour employed by the recover the amount
so paid from the contractor either by deduction form any amount payable to the
contractor under any contract or as a debt payable by the contractor.
Section 10 prohibits employment of contract labour with a non obstante clause. The
appropriate Government, after consultation with the Central Advisory Board or, as
the case may be, State Board Prohibit, by notification published in the official
Gazette, employment of contract labour in any establishment. Before issue of any
such notification, the appropriate Government is enjoined to have regard to the
conditions of work and benefits provided for the contract labour in the establishment
and other relevant factors, such as -(a) whether the process, operation or other work
is incidental to, or necessary for the industry, trade, business, manufacture or
occupation that is carried on in the establishment; (b) whether it is of perennial
nature, that is to say, it is of sufficient duration having regard to the nature of
industry, trade, business, manufacture of occupation carried on in that
establishment;
(c) whether it is done ordinarily through regular workmen in that establishment or an
establishment similar thereto; and
(d) whether it is sufficient to employ considerable number of whole-time workmen.
Section 20 makes it mandatory to provide the amenities of welfare and health
facilities enjoined in Sections 16 and 19. The expenses incurred in that behalf may be
recovered, by the principal employer, from the contractor. The penalty for
non-compliance is provide in Sections 23 and 24 of the Act. Offences by companies
are dealt with under Section 25. For the prosecution of non-cognisable offences,
complaint is to be laid with previous sanction of the Inspector in writing.
Section 27 prescribes limitation for laying prosecution.
Rules have been prescribed in that behalf for effective enforcement of the Act. Forms and terms and
conditions of licence have been prescribed in Rules 21 to 25. Chapter V of the Central Rules deals
with welfare and health of the contract labour. Chapter VI deals with payment of wages to the
workmen and the manner of payment has also been provided therein. Form III referred to in Rule
Air India Statutory Corporation vs United Labour Union & Ors on 6 November, 1996
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/784921/
21
18 (3) envisages, among others, name and address of the contractor, nature of work in which
contract labour is to be employed on any day, maximum number of contract labour to be employed
on any date, probable duration of employment of contract labour etc. The licence issued in Form IV
under Rule 21(1) indicates the particulars envisaged in Forms III. Form XIII under Rule 75 requires
information as to the list of workmen employed by the contractor and also to be specified, the name
and surname of the workmen, Sl. No., age and sex, father's/husband's name, nature of employment,
designation, permanent home address of the workmen, date of commencement of employment,
signature/thumb impression of workmen, date of termination. Certificate of completion of the work
has been provided in form XV as per Rule 77, Forms XVII as per Rule 78 (1) (a) (i) is Register of
wages and provides the particulars, apart from other details, number of days worked, units of work
done, daily-rate of wages/piece rate etc. Register of wages-cum-Muster Roll is prescribed in Form
XVIII referred to in Rule 78 (i) (a) (i) and requires details in particular as to daily attendance, units
worked, designation/nature of work, total attendance, units of work done, overtime wages etc. It
would thus be seen that before the Central or State Advisory Board advises the appropriate
Government under Section 10(1) on the issue whether or not to abolish the contractor labour
system, it has before it all the relevant factual material and the appropriate Government after the
receipt and consideration of the recommendations and the material and then takes decision.
The pivotal question for consideration is : on abolition of the contract labour by publication of a
notification in the Gazette under sub-section (1) of Section 10, what would be the consequences ? It
is seen that so long as the contract labour system continues, the principal employer is enjoined to
ensure payment of wages to the contract labour and to provide all other amenities envisaged under
the Act and the Rules including provisions for food, potable water, health and safety and failure
thereof visits with penal consequences.
The 42nd Constitution (Amendment) Act, 1976, brought explicitly in the Preamble socialist and
secular concepts in sovereign democratic republic of Bharat with effect form January 3,1977. The
Preamble was held as part of Constitution in His Holiness Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalavaru vs.
State of Kerala [1973 Supp. SCR 1]. The provisions of the Constitution including Fundamental
Rights are alterable but the result thereof should be consistent with the basic foundation and the
basic structure of the Constitution. Republican and democratic form of Government, secular
character of the Constitution, separation of powers, dignity and freedom to the individual are basic
features and foundations easily discernible, not only from the Preamble but the whole scheme of the
Constitution. In S.R. Bommai vs. Union of India [(1994) 3 SCC 1], it was held that Preamble of the
Constitution is the basic feature. Either prior to 42nd Constitution (Amendmet) Act, or thereafter,
though the word "socialist" was not expressly brought out separately in the main parts of the
Constitution, i.e., in the Chapters on Fundamental Rights or the Directive Principles, its seed- beds
are right to participation in public offices, right to seek consideration for appointment to an office or
post; right to life and right to equality which would amplify the roots of socialism in democratic
form of Government; right to equality of status and of opportunity, right to equal access to public
places and right to freedoms, protective discrimination, abolition of untouchability, its practice in
any form an constitutional offence, as guaranteed in Part III & IV i.e., Fundamental Rights and
Directive Principles which to every citizen are Fundamental Rights. In Minerva Mills Ltd. & Ors. vs.
Union of India & Ors. [(1981 (1) SCR 206 = AIR 1980 SC 1789], the Constitution Bench had held
Air India Statutory Corporation vs United Labour Union & Ors on 6 November, 1996
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/784921/
22
that the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles are two wheels of the chariot in
establishing the egalitarian social order. Right to life enshrined in Article 21 means something more
than survival of animal existence. It would include the right to live with human dignity [vide Francis
Coralie Mullin vs. The Administrator, Union Territory of Delhi & Ors. (AIR 1981 SC 746 para 3);
Olga Tellis vs. Bombay Municipal Corporation vs. D.T.C. Mazdoor Congress [AIR 1991 SC 101 para
223,234 and 259 = (1991) supp. 1 SCC 600]. Right to means of livelihood and the right to dignity,
right to health, right to potable water, right to pollution free environment and right to life. Social
justice has been held to be Fundamental right in consumer Eduction and Research Centre vs. Union
of India [(1995) 3 SCC 42 = 1995 (1) SCALE 354 at 375]. The Directive Principles in our Constitution
are fore-runners of the U.N.O. Convention on Right to Development as inalienable human right and
every persons and all people are entitled to participate in, contribute to and enjoy economic, social
cultural and political development in which all human right, fundamental freedoms would be fully
realised. It is the responsibility of the State as well as the individuals, singly and collectively, for the
development taking into account the need for fuller responsibility for the human rights,
fundamental freedoms as well as the duties to the community which alone can ensure free and
complete fulfilment of the human being. They promote and protect an appropriate social and
economic order in democracy for development. The State should provide facilities and opportunities
to ensure development and to eliminate all obstacles to development by appropriate economic and
social reforms so as to eradicate all social injustice. These principles are imbedded, as stated earlier,
as integral part of our Constitution in the Directive Principles. Therefore , the Directive Principles
now stand elevated to inelienable fundamental human rights. Even they are justiciable by
themselves. Social and economic democracy is the foundation for stable political democracy. To
make them a way of life in the Indian polity, law as a social engineer, is to create just social order,
remove the inequalities in social and economic life and socio-economic disabilities with which
people are languishing; and to require positive opportunities and facilities as individuals and groups
of persons for development of human personality in our civilised democratic set up so that every
individual would strive constantly to rise t higher levels. Dr. Ambedkar, in his closing speech in the
Constituent Assembly on November 25, 1949, had lucidly elucidated the meaning of social and
political democracy. He stated that it means a way of life which recognised liberty, equality and
franternity as the principles of life. They form an integral union. One cannot divorce from the other;
otherwise it would defeat the very purpose of democracy. Without equality, liberty would produce
supremacy of the few over the many equality without liberty would kill the initiative to improve the
individual`s excellence, political equality without socio-economic equality would run the rusk of
democratic institutions to suffer a set back. Therefore, for establishment of just social order in which
social and economic democracy would be a way of life inequalities in income should be removed and
every endeavour be made to eliminate inequalities in status through the rule of law.
"Socialism" brought into the preamble and its sweep elaborately was considered by
this Court in several judgments. It was held that the meaning of the word "socialism"
in the Preamble of the Constitution was expressly brought in the Constitution to
establish an egalitarian social order through rule of law as its basis structure. In
Minerva Mills Ltd. case, the Constitution Bench had considered the meaning of the
word "socialism" to crystalise a socialistic state securing to its people socio-economic
justice by interplay of the Fundamental rights and the Directive Principles. In D.S.
Air India Statutory Corporation vs United Labour Union & Ors on 6 November, 1996
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/784921/
23
Nakara & Ors. v. Union of India [(1983) 2 SCR 165], another Constitution Bench had
held that the democratic socialism achieves socio- economic revolution to end
poverty, ignorance, disease and inequality of opportunity. The basic framework of
socialism was held to provide security from cradle to grave. The less equipped person
shall be assured to decent minimum standard of life to prevent exploitation in any
form, equitable distribution of national cake and to push the disadvantaged to the
upper ladder of life. It was further held that the Preamble directs the centers of
power, the Legislative, Executive and Judiciary, to strive to shift up from a wholly
feudal exploited slave society to a vibrant, throbbing socialist welfare society which is
a long march; but during the journey to the fulfilment of goal, every State action,
whenever taken, must be directed and must be so interpreted as to take the society
towards that goal. Dr. V.K.R.V Rao, one of the eminent economists of India in his
"Indian Socialism - retrospect and prospect" has stated that equitable distribution of
the income and maximisation of the production is the object of socialism under the
Constitution to solve the problems of umemployment, low income and mass poverty
and to bring about a significant improvement in the national standard of living. he
also stated that to bring about socialism, deliberate and purposive action on the part
of the State, in regard to production as sell as distribution and the necessary savings,
investment, use of human skills and use of science and technology should be brought
about. Changes in property relations, taxation, public expenditure, education and the
social services are necessary to make a socialist State under the Constitution, a
reality. It must also bring about, apart from distribution of income, full employment
as also increase in the production. In State of Karnataka v. Shri Ranganatha Reddy &
Anr. [(1978) 1 SCR 641], a Bench of nine judges of this Court, considering the
nationalisation of the contract carriages, had held that the aim of socialism is the
distribution of the material resources of the community in such a way as to subserve
the commonhood. The principle embodied in Article 39(b) of the Constitution is one
of the essential directives to bring about the distribution of the material resources. It
would give full play to the distributive justice. It fulfills the basic purpose of re-
structuring the economic order. Article 39(b), therefore, has a social mission. it
embraces the entire material resources of the community. Its task is to distribute
such resources. Its goal is to undertake distribution as best to subserve the common
good. In Sanjeev Coke Manufacturing Co. v. Bharat Cooking Coal Ltd. & Anr. [(1983)
1 SCR 1000], another Constitution Bench interpreted the word "socialism"
and Article 39(b) of the Constitution and had held that the broad egalitarian principle of economic
justice was implicit in every Directive Principle. The law was designed to promote broader
egalitarian social goals to do economic justice for all. The object of nationalisation of mining was to
distribute nation's resources. In State of Tamil Nadu etc. v. L. Abu Kavur Bai & Ors. etc. [(1984) 1
SCR 725], the same interpretation was given by another Constitution Bench upholding
nationalisation of State Carriages and Contract Carriages (Acquisition) Act. Therefore, all State
actions should be such to make socio-economic democracy with liberty, equality and fraternity, a
reality to all the people through democratic socialism under the rule of law.

In Consumer Education & Research Centre & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors. [(1995) 3 SCC 42], a
Bench of three Judges (to which one of us, K. Ramaswamy, J., was a member) had to consider
whether right to health of workers in the Asbestos industries is a fundamental right and whether the
management was bound to provide the same? In that context, considering right to life under Article
21, its meaning, scope and content, this Court had held that the jurisprudence of personhood or
philosophy of the right to life envisaged under Article 21 enlarges its sweep to encompass human
personality in its full blossom with invigorated health which is a wealth to the workman to earn his
livelihood, to sustain the dignity of person and to live a life with dignity and equality. The expression
"life" assured in Article 21, does not connote mere animal existence or continued drudgery through
life. It has a much wider meaning which includes right to livelihood, better standard of living,
hygienic conditions in the workplace and leisure.
Right to health and medical care to protect health and vigour, while in service or after retirement,
was held a fundamental right of a worker under Article 21, read with Articles 39(e), 41,43,48 - A and
all related constitutional provisions and fundamental human rights to make the life of the workman
meaningful and purposeful with dignity of person. The right to health of a worker is an integral facet
of meaningful right to life, to have not only a meaningful existence but also robust health and vigour
without which the worker would lead a life of misery. Lack of health denudes him of his livelihood.
Compelling economic necessity to work in an industry exposed to health hazards, due to indigence
for bread-winning for himself and his dependents, should not be at the cost of the health and vigour
of the workman.
The Preamble and Article 38 of the Constitution envision social justice as the arch to ensure life to
be meaningful and livable with human dignity. Jurisprudence is the eye of law giving an insight into
the environment of which it is the expression. It relates the law to the spirit of the time and kames it
richer. Law is the ultimate aim of every civilised society, as a key system in a given era, to meet the
needs and demands of its time. Justice, according to law, comprehends social urge and
commitment. The Constitution commands justice, liberty, equality and fraternity as supreme values
to usher the egalitarian social, economic and political democracy. Social justice, equality and dignity
of persons are cornerstones of social democracy. The concept of "social justice" which the
Constitution of India engrafted, consists of diverse principles essential for the orderly growth and
development of personality of every citizen. "Social justice" is thus an integral part of justice in the
generic sense. Justice is the genus, of which social justice is one of its species. Social justice is a
dynamic device to mitigate the sufferings of the poor, weak, dalits, tribals and deprived sections of
the society and to elevate them to the level of equality to live a life with dignity of person. Social
justice is not a simple or single idea of a society but is an essential part of complex social change to
relive the poor etc. From handicaps, penury to ward off distress and to make their life livable, for
greater good of the society at large. In other words, the aim of social justice is to attain substantial
degree of social, economic and political equality, which is the legitimate expectation and
constitutional goal. Social security, just and humane conditions of work and leisure to workman are
part of his meaningful right to life and to achieve self-expression of his personality and to enjoy the
life with dignity. The State should provide facility and opportunities to enable them to reach at least
minimum standard of health, economic security and civilised living while sharing according to their
capacity, social and cultural heritage.

In a developing society like ours, steeped with unbridgeable and ever-widening gaps of inequality in
status and of opportunity, law is a catalyst, rubicon to the poor etc, to reach the ladder of social
justice. What is due cannot be ascertained by an absolute standard which keeps changing,
depending upon the time, place and circumstance. The constitutional concern of social justice as an
elastic continuous process is to accord justice to all sections of the society by providing facilities and
opportunities to remove handicaps and disabilities with which the poor, the workmen etc, are
languishing and to secure dignity of their person. The Constitution, therefore, mandates the State to
accord justice to all members of the society in all facets of human activity. The concept of social
justice embads equality to flavour and enliven the practical content of life. Social justice and equality
are complementary to each other so that both should maintain their vitality. Rule of law, therefore,
is a potent instrument of social justice to bring about equality in results. it was accordingly held that
right to social justice and right to health were held to be Fundamental Rights. The management was
directed to provide health insurance during service and at least 15 years after retirement and
periodical tests protecting the health of the workmen.
In LIC of India & Anr. v. Consumer Education & Research Centre & Ors. [(1995) 5 SCC 482],
considering the Life Insurance Corporation's right to fix the rates of premium, this court had held
that the authorities or private persons or industry are bound by the directives contained in Part IV
and the Fundamental Rights in Part III and the Preamble of the Constitution. The right to carry on
trade is subject to the directives contained in the Constitution, the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, European Convention of Social, Economic and Cultural Rights and the Convention on Right
to Development for Social Economic Justice. Social security is a facet of socio-economic justice to
the people and a means to livelihood. In Murlidhar Dayandeo Kesekar V. Vishwanath Pandu Barde
& Anr.[1995 supp (2) SCC 549] (to which two of us, K. Ramasway, and B.L. Hansaria JJ., were
members), the question arose; whether the alienation of the lands assigned to Scheduled Tribes was
valid in law ? In that context considering the Preamble, the Directive Principles and the
Fundamental Rights including the right to life, this court had held that economic empowerment and
social justice are Fundamental Rights to the tribes. The basic aim to the welfare State is the
attainment of substantial degree of social, economic and political equalities and to achieve
self-expression in his work as a citizen, leisure and social justice. The distinguishing characteristic of
the welfare State is the assumption by community acting through the State and as its responsibilities
to provide the means, whereby all its members can reach minimum standard of economic security,
civilised living, capacity to secure social status and culture to keep good health. The welfare State,
therefore, should take positive measure to assist the community at large to act in collective
responsibility towards its member and should take positive measure to assist them to achieve the
above. It was, therefore, held thus:
"Article 21 of the Constitution assures right to life. To make right to life meaningful
and effective, this court put up expansive interpretation and brought within its ambit
right to education, health, speedy trial, equal wages for equal work as fundamental
rights. Articles 14, 15 and 16 prohibit discrimination and accord equality. The
Preamble to the Constitution as a socialist republic visualises to remove economic
inequalities and to provide facilities and opportunities for decent standard of living
and to protect the economic interest of the weaker segments of the society, in

particular, Scheduled Castes i.e. Dalits and the Scheduled Tries i.e. Tribes and to
protect them from "all forms of exploitations". Many a day have come and gone after
26.1.1950 but no leaf is turned in the lives of the poor and the gap between the rich
and the poor is gradually widening on the brink of being unbridgeable.
Providing adequate means of livelihood for all the citizens and distribution of the
material resources of the community for common welfare, enable the poor, the Dalits
and Tribes to fulfill the basic needs to bring about a fundamental change in the
structure of the Indian society which was divided by erecting impregnable walls of
separation between the people on grounds of caste, sub-
caste, creed, religion, race, language and sex. Equality of opportunity and State
thereby would become the bedrocks for social integration. Economic empowerment
thereby is the foundation of make equality of status, dignity to person and equal
opportunity a truism. The core of the commitment of the Constitution of the social
revolution through rule of law lies in effectuation of the fundamental right directive
principles as supplementary and complementary to each other. The Preamble,
fundamental rights and directive principles - the trinity - are the conscience of the
Constitution.
Political democracy has to be stable. Socio-economic democracy must take strong
roots and should become a way of life. The State, therefore, is enjoined to provide
adequate means of livelihood to the poor, weaker sections of the society, the Dalits
and Tribes and to distribute material resources of the community to them for
common welfare etc".
It was accordingly held that right to economic empowerment is a fundamental right.
The alienation of assigned land without permission of competent authority was held
void.
In R. Chandevarappa and Ors. v. State of Karnataka and Ors. [(1995) 6 SCC 309] (to
which two of us, K. Ramaswamy and B.L. Hansaria, JJ., were members) this Court
was to consider whether the alienation of Government lands allotted to the Scheduled
Castes was in violation of the Constitutional objectives under Article 39(b) and 46. It
was held that economic empowerment to the Dalits, Tribes and the poor as a part of
distributive justice is a Fundamental Right; assignment of the land to them under
Article 39(b) was to provide socio-economic justice to the Scheduled Castes. The
alienation of the land, therefore, was held to be in violation of the Constitutional
objectives. It was held thus:
"In fact, the cumulative effect of social and economic legislation is to specify the basic
structure.

Moreover, the social system shapes the wants and aspirations and its citizens come to
have. It determines in part the sort of persons they want to be as well as the sort of
persons they are. Thus an economic system is not only an institutional device for
satisfying existing wants and needs but a way of creating and fashioning wants in the
future. The economic empowerment, therefore, to the poor, dalits and tribes as an
integral constitutional scheme of socio-economic democracy is a way of life of
political democracy.
Economic empowerment is, therefore, a basic human right and a fundamental right
as part of right to live, equality and of status and dignity to the poor, weaker sections,
dalits and tribes.
The prohibition from alienation is to effectuate the constitutional policy of economic
empowerment under Article 14, 21, 38, 39 and 46 read with the Preamble of the
Constitution. Accordingly refusal to permit alienation is to effectuate the
constitutional policy. the alienation was declared to be void under sections 23 of the
Contract Act being violative of the constitutional scheme of economic empowerment
of accord equality of status, dignity of persons and economic empowerment."
It was further held that providing adequate means of livelihood for all the citizens
and the distribution of the material resources of the community for common welfare,
enable the poor, the dalits and the tribes, to fulfill the basic needs to bring about the
fundamental change in the structure of the Indian society. Equality of opportunity
and status would thereby become the bedrocks for social integration. Economic
empowerment is, therefore, a basic human right and fundamental right as apart of
right to life to make political democracy stable. Socio-economic democracy must take
strong route and become a way of life. The state, therefore, is enjoined to provide
adequate means of livelihood to the poor, weaker sections of the society, the dalits
and the tribes and distribute material resources of the community to them for
common welfare. Justice is an attribute of human conduct and rule of law is
indispensable foundation to establish socio-economic justice. The doctrine of
political economy must include interpretation for the public good which is based on
justice that would guide the people when questions of economic and social policy are
under consideration. In Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Ltd. & Anr. v.
Reserve Bank of India [(1992) 2 SCC 343 at 389 para 55], this court had held that
stability of the political democracy hinges upon socio- economic democracy. Right to
development is one of the important facets of basic human rights. Right to self-
interest is inherent in right to life. Mahatma Gandhiji, the Father of Nation said that
"every human being has a right to live and, therefore, to find the wherewithal to feed
himself and where necessary to clothe and house himself". In D.K. Yadav v. J.M.A.
Industries Ltd. [(1993) 3 SCC 259], the question was whether the workman for
absence in service for 7 days can be removed without an enquiry. In that context a
bench of three judges had held thus:

28
"Article 21 clubs life with liberty, dignity of person with means of livelihood without
which the glorious contents of dignity of person would be reduced to animal
existence. When right to life is interpreted in the light of the colour and content of
procedure established by law must be in conformity with the minimum fairness and
processual justice, it would relieve legislative callousness despising opportunity of
being heard and fair opportunities of defence. Article 14 has pervasive processual
potency and versatile quality, equalitarian in its soul and allergic to discriminatory
dictates. Equality is the antithesis of arbitrariness".
In Dalmia Cement (Bharat) Ltd. & Anr. vs. Union of India & Ors. etc. [JT 1996 (4) SC 555], a Bench
of three judges (to which one of us, K. Ramaswamy, J., was a member) was to consider the
constitutionality of Jute Packing Material Act, 1987. The law was made to protect the agriculturists
cultivating jute and jute products. In that context if was held thus:
"thus agriculturists have fundamental rights to social justice and economic empowerment.
The Preamble of the Constitution is the epitome of the basic structure built in the Constitution
guaranteeing justice - social, economic and political - equality of status and of opportunity with
dignity of person and fraternity.
To establish an egalitarian social order, the trinity, the Preamble, the Fundamental Rights in Part III
and Directive Principles of State Policy (for short, 'Directives') in Chapter IV of the Constitution
delineated the socio-economic justice. The word justice envision in the Preamble is used in broad
spectrum to harmonise individual right with the general welfare of the society. The Constitution is
the supreme law. The purpose of law is realisation of justice whose content and scope vary
depending upon the prevailing social environment. Every social and economic change causes change
in the law. In a democracy governed by rule of law, it is not possible to change the legal basis of
socio-
economic life of the community without bringing about corresponding change in the law. In
interpretation of the Constitution and the law, endeavour needs to be made to harmonise the
individual interest with the paramount interest of the community keeping pace with the realities of
every changing social and economic life of the community envisaged in the Constitution. Justice in
the Preamble implies equality consistent with the competing demands between distributive justice
with those of cumulative justice. Justice aims to promote the general well-being of the community as
well as individual's excellence. The principal end of society is to protect the enjoyment of the rights
of the individuals subject to social order, well-
being and morality. Establishment of priorities of liberties is a political judgment.
Law is the foundation on which the potential of the society stands.
Law is an instrument for society stands. Law is an instrument for social change as also defender for
social change.

Social justice is the comprehensive form to remove social imbalances by law harmonising the rival
claims or the interests of different groups and/or sections in the social structure or individuals by
means of which alone it would be possible to build up a welfare State. The idea of economic justice is
to make equality of status meaningful and the life worth living at its best removing inequality of
opportunity and of status - social, economic and political.
Law is the ultimate aim of every civilised society, as a key system in a given era, to meet the needs
and demands of its time. Justice, according to law, comprehends social urge and commitment.
Justice, liberty, equality and fraternity are supreme constitutional values to establish the egalitarian
social, economic and political democracy, Social justice, equality and dignity of person are
cornerstones of social democracy. Social justice consist of diverse principles essential for the orderly
growth and development of personality of every citizen.
Justice is its facet, a dynamic device to mitigate the sufferings of the disadvantaged and to eliminate
handicaps so as to elevate them to the level of equality to live life with dignity of person. Social
justice is not a simple or single idea of a society but it an essential part of complex social change to
relieve the poor etc. From handicaps, penury, to ward the off from distress and to make their lives
livable for greater good of the society at large. Social justice, therefore, gives substantial degree of
social, economic and political equality, which is the constitutional right of every citizen. In para 19, it
was further elaborated that social justice is one of the disciplines of justice which relates to the
society. What is due cannot be ascertained by absolute standard which keeps changing depending
upon the time, place and circumstances.
The constitutional concern of social justice, as an elastic continuous process, is to transform and
accord justice to all sections of the society by providing facilities and opportunities to remove
handicaps and disabilities with which the poor etc, are languishing. It aims to secure dignity of their
person. It is the duty of the State of accord justice to all members of the society in all facts of human
activity. The concept of social justice embeds equality to flavour and enlivens practical content of
life. Social justice and equality are complementary to each other so that both should maintain their
vitality. Rule of law, therefore, is a potent instrument of social justice to bring about equality in
result.
Social and economic justice in the context of our Indian Constitution must, therefore, be understood
in a comprehensive sense go remove every inequality to all citizens in social as well as economic
activities and in every part of life. Economic justice means the abolition of those economic
conditions which ultimately result in the inequality of economic values between men. It means to
establish a democratic way of life built upon socio-economic structure of the society to make the rule
of law dynamic.
The Fundamental Rights and the Directive are, therefore, harmoniously be interpreted to make the
law a social engineer to provide flesh and blood to the dry bones of law. The Directives would serve
the Court as a beacon light to interpretation. Fundamental Rights are rightful means to the end, viz.,
Social and economic justices provided in the Directives and the Preamble. The Fundamental Rights

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/784921/
30
and the Directives establish the trinity of equality, liberty and fraternity in an egalitarian social order
and prevent exploitation.
Social justice, therefore, forms the basis of progressive stability in the society and human progress.
Economic justice means abolishing such economic conditions which remove the inequality of
economic value between man and man, concentration of wealth and means of production in the
hands of a few and are detrimental to the vast.
Law, therefore, must seek to serve as a flexible instrument of socio-
economic adjustment to bring about peaceful socio-economic revolution under rule of law. The
Constitution, the fundamental supreme lex distributes the sovereign power between the Executive,
the Legislature and the Judiciary. The Court, therefore, must strive to give harmonious
interpretation to propel forward march and progress towards establishing an egalitarian social
order."
The validity of the Act was accordingly upheld. It is already seen that in D.T.C's case (supra), this
Court had held that right to life to a workman would include right to continue in permanent
employment which is not a bounty of the employer nor can its survival be at the volition and mercy
of the employer. Income is the foundation to enjoy many Fundamental right and when work is the
source of income, the right to work would become as such a fundamental right. Fundamental Right
can ill-afford to be consigned to the limbo of undefined premises and uncertain application. In
Bandhu Mukti Morcha vs. Union of India [(1984) 3 SCC 161], this Court had held that the right to
life with human dignity enshrined in Article 21 derives its life breath from the Directive Principles of
State Policy and that opportunities and facilities should be provided to the people. In Olga Tellis's
case, this court had held that the right to livelihood is an important facet of the right to life .
Deprivation of the means of livelihood would denude the life itself. In C.E.S.C Ltd. & Ors. vs. S.C.
Bose & Ors. [(1992) 1 SCC 441], it was held that the right to social and economic justice is a
fundamental right. Right to health of a worker is a fundamental right. The right to live with human
dignity at least with minimum sustenance and shelter and all those rights and aspects of life which
would o to make a man's life complete and worth living, would form part of the right to life.
Enjoyment of life and its attainment - social, cultural and intellectual - without which life cannot be
meaningful, would embrace the protection and preservation of life guaranteed by Article 21. In life
Insurances Corporation case, a Bench of two Judge had held that right to economic equality is a
fundamental right. In Dalmia Cement Bharat Ltd. case, right to economic justice was held to be a
fundamental right. Right to shelter was held to be a fundamental right in Olga Tellis's case; P.G.
Gupta vs. State of Gujarat & ors, [(1995) Supp.(2) SCC 182]; M/s. Shantisar Builders vs. Narayan
Khimlal Totame & Ors. [(1990) 1 SCC 520]; Chameli Singh & ors. vs. State of U.P. & Anr. [(1996) 2
SCC 549] etc. It would, thus, be seen that all essential facilities and opportunities to the poor people
are fundamental means to development, to live with minimum comforts, food, shelter, clothing and
health. Due to economic constraints, though right to work was not declared as a fundamental right,
right to work of workman, lower class, middle class and poor people is means to development and
source to earn livelihood. thought, right to employment cannot, as a right, be claimed but after the

appointment to a post or an office, be it under the State, its agency instrumentality, jurisdic person
or private interpreneur it is required to be dealt with as per public element and to act in public
interest assuring equality, which is a genus of Article 14 and all other concomitant rights emanating
therefrom are species to make their right to life and dignity of person real and meaningful. The
democracy offers to everyone as doer, an exerter and developer and enjoyer of his human capacities,
as stated by Justice K.K. Mathew, in his "The Right to Equality and Property under the Indian
Constitution" at page 47-48. These exercises of human capacity require access to the material
resources and also continuous and sufficient intake of material means to maintain human energy.
Lack of access to the material resources is an impediment to the development of human personality.
This impediment, as a lack of access to means of labour, if we take labour i its broadest sense of
human resources, requires removal only under the rule of law. To the workmen, right to
employment is the property, source of livelihood and dignity of person an means of enjoy life, health
and leisure. Equality, as a principle of justice, governs leisure, the distribution of material resources
including right to employment. Private property ownership has always required special justifications
and qualifications to reconcile the institution with the public interest. It requires to thrive and, at
the same time, be responsive to social weal and welfare. St. Thomas Acquinas, in his "Selected
Political Writings" (1948 Edn.) at page 169, has stated that the private rights and public needs are to
be balanced to meet the public interest "the common possession of things is to be attributed to
natural law, not in the sense that natural law decrees that all things are to be held in common and
that there is to be no private possession, but in the sense that there is no distinction of property on
the grounds of natural law, but only by human agreement, and this pertains to positive law, as we
have already shown. Thus, private property is not opposed to natural law, but is an addition to it,
devised by human reasons. If, however, there is such urgent and evident necessity that there is
clearly an immediate need to necessary sustenance, if, for example, a person is in immediate danger
of physical privation, and there is no other way of satisfying his need, then he may take what is
necessary from another person's goods, either openly or by stealth. Nor is this strictly speaking
fraud or robbery." Property is a social institution based upon an economic need in a society
organised through division of labour, as propounded by Dean Rosco Pound in his "An Introduction
to Philosophy of law" (1954 Edn.) page 125, at
129. M.R. Cohen in his "Property and Sovereignty" [13 Cornell Law Quarterly page 8 at 12 had stated
that " the principle of freedom of personality certainly cannot justify a legal order wherein a few can,
by virtue of their legal monopoly over necessities, compel others to work under degrading and
brutalizing condition." If there is no property or of one does not derive fruits and means of one's
labour, no one would have any incentive to labour in the broader sense, Social progress receives set
back without equality of status, fraternity would not be maximised. Edward Kent in his "Property,
Power and Authority", Prof. Herald Laski in his "Congress Socialist" dated April 11, 1936, had stated
that "those who know the normal life of the poor will realise enough that without economic security,
liberty is not worth living". Brooklyn Law Review page 541 at 547 has stated that "In modern
translation, public officers and others who promulgate polices designed to increase unemployment
or to deny or diminish benefits to the poor are accountable for the consequences to free human
personality." It would, thus, be clear that in a socialist democracy governed by the rule of law,
private property, right of the citizen for development and his right to employment and his
entitlement for employment to the labour, would all harmoneously be blended to serve larger social

32
interest and public purpose.
Mahatma Gandhiji, the Father of the Nation, in his book "Socialism of my concept", has said thus:
"To a people famishing and idle, the only acceptable form in which God can dare
appear is work and promise of food as wages. God created man to work for his food,
and said that those who ate without work were thieves. Eighty per cent of India are
compulsory thieves half the year. Is it any wonder if India has become one vast
prison?"
Again, he stressed:
No one has ever suggested that grinding pauperism can lead to anything else than
moral degradation. Every human being has a right to live and, therefore, to find the
wherewithal to feed himself and, where necessary, to clothe and society the securing
of one's livelihood should be, and is found to be the easiest thing in the world.
Indeed, the test of orderliness in a country is not the number of millionaires it owns,
but the absence of starvation among its masses.
Working for economic equality means abolishing the eternal conflict between capital
and labour. it means the levelling down of the few rich in whose hands is
concentrated the bulk of the nations's wealth on the one hand, and the levelling up of
the semi-staved, naked millions of the other. A non-violent system of Government is
clearly an impossibility so long as the wide gulf between the rich and the hungry
millions persists. The contrast between the palaces of new Delhi and the miserable
hovels of the poor labouring class nearby, cannot last tone day in free India in which
the poor will enjoy the same power as the richest in the land. A violent and bloody
revolution is a certainty one day, unless there is voluntary abdication of riches and
the power that riches give a sharing them for the common good".
Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru, the architect of social and economic planned democracy,
in this "Independence and After That" (Collection of Speeches 1946-49) Publication
Division, Government of India 1949 Edn, at page 28, had stated that social equality in
the widest sense and equality of opportunity for every one, every man and woman
must have the opportunity to develop to the best of his or her ability. However, Merit
must come from ability and hard work and not because of cast of birth or riches.
Social equality would develop the sense of fraternity among the members of a social
groups where each would consider the other as his equal, no higher or lower. A
society, which does not treat each of its members as equals, forfeits its right to being
called a democracy. All are equal partners in the freedom. Every one of our ninety
four hundred million people must have equal right to opportunities and blessings
that freedom of India has to offer. To bring freedom in a comprehensive sense to the
common man, material resources and opportunity for appointment be made
available to secure socio-economic empowerment which would ensure justice and

33
fullness of life to workmen, i.e., every man and woman. In "Beyond Justice"
by Agnes Heller at page 80, the distribution of material goods, he had stated on
distributive justice thus:
"The distribution of material goods had always been of concern in images and
theories of justice, but, even when the issue was given the highest importances, it was
subjected to and understood within a general theory of justice, and addressed within
the framework of a complete socio-political concept of justice. As we have seen, in the
prophetic concept of justice the misery of the poor called for dividne retribution,
since alleviating misery was believed to be a matter not of optional charity but of
moral duty, To neglect this duty was to sin, to breach the divine laws. Plato proposed
the abolition of private property for the caste of guardians in order to make the
Republic as a whole just.
Aristotle, who coined the term 'distributive justice', recommended a relative equality
of wealth -
neither too much nor too little, but 'medium wealth' - as a condition of the good life of
the good citizen and the good city.
Even Roussseau., the most egalitarian philosopher in respect of distribution,
subjected the solution of this problems to the general patterns of an socio-
political concept of justice.
Locke did not completely break with this longstanding tradition either. As we have
seen, he contributed to the emergence of the concept' retributive justice' rather than
'distributive justice. However, he had already presented a sophisticated theory
legitimizing inequality in property owner ship, a theory deriving property from work.
I have mentioned that Locke did not support the idea 'to each according to his
entitlement', for he but 'entitlement' into the 'to each category, whereas the
'according to category was defined by 'work' (mixing work and nature).
But Locke never claimed that entitlement was the main issue, let alone the only issue
of justice.
Humane is undoubtedly the founding father of that branch of socio -
political justice now called 'distributive'. He even claimed that property and property
alone is the subject matter of justice. He asserted too that retribution (negative
sanctions) in the suspension of justice for the sake of social utility: 'When any man,
vein in political society, renders himself by his crimes, obnoxious of the public, he is
punished by the law in his goods and person; that is, the ordinary rules of justice are,
Air India Statutory Corporation vs United Labour Union & Ors on 6 November, 1996
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/784921/
34
with regard to him suspended for a moment.
Humane also deduced justice from 'public utility'. Inequality in property ownership is
just because it is useful. We can imagine two cases - and extreme cases- where
property (inequality in property ownership) qua justice loses its social usefulness: the
situation of absolute abundance and the situation of absolute scarcity. In the former,
property is useless, redundant because, if all needs can be satisfied, we are beyond
justice. In the latter situation property rules are violable, thus justice must be be
suspended. Yet we live in a situation of limited abundance (or limited scarcity).
This is Humane the concept 'justice' reduces to the idea 'to reach according to his
property entitlement'; all other uses of the notion 'justice' are seen as relating to the
'suspension of justice' ) although the term 'equity' can remain relevant in these other
contexts). Humane, an extremely sincere man, did not shirk from facing proposal
alien to his own. He stated, nature is so liberal to mankind, that. were all her presents
equally divided among the species, and improved by art and industry, every
individual would enjoy all the necessaries, and even most of the comforts of life. It
must also be confessed, that, wherever we depart from this equality, we rob the poor
of more satisfaction than we add to the rich."
Justice K.K. Mathew in his "Democracy Equality and Freedom" at page 55 has,
therefore, stated that the singlemost important problem in constitutional law for
years to come in this court will be how to implement the Directive Principles and at
the same time give full play to the Fundamental Right. It is only by implementing the
Directive Principle that distributive justice will be achieved in the society. Justice, as
Aristotle said, "is the bond of men in society" and "States without justice" are, as St.
Augustine said, "robber-bands".
In Keshvanand Bharti's case, Jaganmohan Reddy, J. had held that "what is emplicit in the
Constitution is that there is a duty one the courts to interpret the Constitution and the laws to
further the Directive Principles which under Article 37 are fundamental in the governance of the
country". The majority had held in favour of the way for the implementation of the Directive
Principles under rule of law. Justice Palekar, in particular had laid emphasis on social and economic
justice to make fundamental Rights a reality.
Coming to the meaning of "regulation" under the Act, in Blacks law Dictionary (sixth edition) at
page 1286 the word "regulation" is defined as "the act of regulating; a rule or order prescribed for
management or government; a regulating principle; a precept. Rule or order prescribed by superior
or competent authority relating to action of those under its control". In Corpus Juris Secunderon
(Vol.76) at page 612, the power to regulate carries with it full power or the thing subject to
regulation and in the absence of restrictive words, the power must be regarded as plenary or the
interest of public. it has been held to contemplate or employ the continued existence of the subject
matter. In "Craise on Statute Law" (7th Edition) at page 258, it is stated that if the legislation
enables something to be done, it gives power at the same time "by necessary implication, to do
Air India Statutory Corporation vs United Labour Union & Ors on 6 November, 1996
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/784921/
35
everything which is indispensable for the purpose of carrying out the purposes in view". In D.K.V.
Prasada Rao & Ors. vs. The Government of Andhra Pradesh represented by its secretary, Home
Department Secretariat Buildings, Andhra Pradesh Hyderabad & Anr. [(1983) 2 AWR 344 - AIR
1984 AP], a Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, (to which one of us, K. Ramaswamy,
J., was a member) had to consider the question elaborately whether the power to regulate
cinematograph Act and Andhra Pradesh Cinematograph Regulation would include power to fix rates
of admission under the cinema/theaters. Though there was no specific power under the Act or the
Regulation to fix rates of admission, it was held at page 360 that "power to regulate would include
power to fix the rate of admission into the cinema/theaters". Lord Justice hale of England about
three centuries ago in his treatise "De Portibus Moris" reported in Harg law tracts 78 had stated that
"when the private property is affected with a public interest, it ceases to be "juris privati" only and it
becomes clothed with a public interest when used in a manner to make it of public consequence and
affect the community at large; and so using it, the owner grants to the public an interest in that use,
and must submit to be controlled by the public for common good". This Statement was quoted with
approval by the Supreme court of United States of America in 1876 in leading judgment, munn vs
the people of Illinois [94 US 115]. Justice whaite dealing with question whether the legislature can
fix the rates for storage of grains in private warehouses by a statue of 1871 when its interpretation
had come up for consideration of right to property and its enjoyment and of the public interest, it
was held that "under such circumstances it is difficult to see why, if the common carrier or the
miller, or the ferrymen or the innkeeper or the wharfinger or the baker, or the cartmen, or the
chakney-coachman, pursues a public employment and exercise "a sort of public office," these
plaintiffs in error do not. They stand, to use again the language of their counsel, in the very "gateway
of commerce," and take toll from all who pass. Their business "most certainly tends to be a common
charge and has become a thing of public interest and use." Therein, there is a specific observation
which is apposite to the facts in this case. It was held that the statute simply extends the law so as to
meet this new development of commercial progress. There is no attempt to compel the owners to
grant the public an interest in their property, but the Act declares their obligations, if they use it in
the particular manner. It is immaterial whether the plaintiffs therein had built their warehouses and
established their business before the regulation was made. It was held that after, the regulation has
come into force, they are enjoined to abide by the regulation to carry on the business. This Court had
approved the ratio in Prasadrao's case; when it was followed by Karnataka High Court against which
an appeal came to be filed and the power to regulate rates of admission into cinema/theaters was
upheld by this court.
In Horatio J. Olcott vs. County Board of Supervisors of Fond Du Lac County [21 L. Ed. 382 at 388],
the Supreme Court of united states of America had held that whether the railroad is a private or a
public one, the ownership thereof is not material that the owners may be private company but they
are compellable to permit the public to use their works in the manner in which such work can be
used. In John D. Graham, Commissioner, Department of Public Welfare, State of Arizona vs.
Carmen Richardson etc. [29 L.Ed. 2nd 534], the question was whether the respondent alien in
Arizona will be denied of welfare benefits offending 14th Amendment to the American Constitution.
Interpreting 14th Amendment, the Supreme court of united states of America had held that the
word "person" in the context of welfare measures encompasses lawfully resident aliens as well as
citizen of the United States and both citizen and alien are entitled to the equal protection of the laws

of the state in which they reside. The power to deny the welfare benefit was negated by judicial
pronouncement. In Grace Marsh vs. State of Alabama [90 L.Ed. 265], when the appellant was
distributing pamphlets in privately owned colony, be was convicted of the offence of trespass on
albama Statute. On writ of certiorary, the Supreme Court of United States of America deciding the
right to pass and repass and the right of freedom of expression and equality under 14th amendment,
had held by majority that the corporate's right to control the inhabitants of the colony is subject to
regulation but the ownership does not always mean absolute denomination. The more an owner, for
his advantage, opens up his property in use by public in general, the more do his right become
circumscribed by statutory and constitutional rights of those who use it. The conviction was in
violation of Ist and 14th Amendment. In Republic Aviation Corporation vs. National Labour
Relations Board [324 US 793 = 89 L.Ed. 1372], the owner of privately held bridges, ferries,
turnpikes and railroads etc. may operate them as freely as a farmer does his farm, but when it
operated privately to benefit the public, their operation is essentially a public function. It was
subject to State regulation. The Supreme court, therefore, had held that when the rights of the
private owners and the constitutional rights requires interpretation, the balance has to be struck and
the court would, mindful of the Fact that the right to exercise liberties safeguarded by the
Constitution lies at the foundation of free government by free men, in all cases weigh the
circumstances and appraise the reasons in support of the regulations of the rights etc. It was
accordingly held that for interpretation of the rights, it is but the duty of the Court to weigh the
balance and to consider the case in the dropback. In Georgia Railroad & Banking Co. vs. James M.
Smith [128 US 377 = 32 L.Ed. 174], it was held that in the absence of any provision in the charter,
legislature has power to prescribe rates when the property is put to public use and the statue was
held to be constitutional. German Aliance Insurance Co. vs. IKL Lews [58 L.Ed. 1011 = 233 US 387],
per majority it was held that a business may be as far as affected with a public interest as to permit
legislative regulation of its rates and charges, although no public trust is imposed upon the property
and although public way not have a legal right to demand and receive service.
It is true that in Dena Nath's case, a Bench of two judges was to consider the question whether or
not the persons appointed as contract labour in violation of section 7 and 12 of the Act should be
deemed to be direct employees of the principal employer. The Bench on literal consideration of the
provisions, had concluded that the act merely regulates condition s of service of the workmen
employed by a contractor and engaged by the principal employer. On abolition of such contract
labour altogether by the appropriate Government nether the Act nor the rules provide that labour
should be directly absorbed by the principal employer. It was, therefore, concluded that the High
Court exercising the power under Article 226 of the Constitution cannot give direction for
absorption. True, Court cannot enquire into and decide the question whether employment of
contract labour in any process operation or any other work in establishment should be abolished or
not and it is for the appropriate Government to decide it. The Act does not provide total abolition of
the contract labour system under the Act. The Act regulates contract labour system to prevent
exploitation of the contract labour. The Preamble of the Act furnishes the key to its scope and
operation. The Act regulates not only employment of contract labour in the establishment covered
under the act and its abolition in certain circumstances covered under section 10 (2) but also
"matters connection therewith". The phrase "matters connected therewith" gives clue to the
intention of the Act. WE have already examined in detain the operation of the provisions of the Act

obviating the need to reiterate the same once over. The enforcement of the provisions to establish
canteen in every establishment under Section 16 is to supply food to the workmen at the subsidised
rates as it is a right to food, a basic human right. Similarly, the provision in Section 17 to provide rest
rooms to the workmen is a right to leisure enshrined in Article 43 of the Constitution. Supply of
wholesome drinking water, establishment of latrine and urinals as enjoined under Section 18 are
part of basic human right to health assured under Article 39 and right to just and human conditions
of work assured under Article 42. All of them are fundamental human rights to the workmen and are
facets of right to life guaranteed under Article 21. When the principal employer is enjoined to ensure
those rights and payment of wages while the contract labour system is under regulation, the
question arises whether after abolition of the contract labour system that workmen should be left in
a lurch denuding them of the means of livelihood and the enjoyment of the basic fundamental rights
provided while the contract labour system is regulated under the Act? The Advisory Committee
constituted under section 10(1) requires to consider whether the process, operation and other work
is incidental to or necessary for the industry,, trade, business, manufacture or occupation that is
carried on in the establishment, whether it is of perennial nature, that is to say, whether it is
substantive duration having regard to the nature of industry, trade, business, manufacture or
occupation carried on in that establishment, whether it is done ordinarily through regular workmen
in the establishment or an establishment similar thereto, whether it is sufficient to employ
considerable number of whole time workmen. Upon consideration of these facts and
recommendation for abolition was made by the advisory Board, the appropriate Government
examines the question and takes a decision in that behalf. The explanation to Section 10 (2) provides
that when any process or operation or other work is of perennial nature, the decision of the
appropriate Government thereon shall be final. It would thus give indication that on the abolition of
the contract labour system by publication of the notification in the official Gazette, the necessary
concomitant is that the whole time workmen are required for carrying on the process, operation or
other work being done in the industry, trade, business, manufacture or occupation in that
establishment. When the condition of the work which is of perennial nature etc., as envisaged in
sub-section (2) of Section 10, thus are satisfied, the continuance of contract labour stands prohibited
and abolished. The concomitant result would be that source of regular employment became open.
What would be the consequence that ensure from abolition is the question? It is true that we find no
express provision in the Act declaring the contract labour working in the establishment of the
principal employer in the particular service to be the direct employees of the principal employer.
Does the Act intend to deny the workmen to continue to work under the Act or does it intend to
denude him of the benefit or permanent employment and if so, what would be the remedy available
to him. The phrase "matters connected therewith" in the Preamble would furnish the consequence
of abolition of contract labour. In this behalf, the Gujarat Electricity Board case, attempted, by
interpretation, to fill in the gap but it also fell shout of full play and got beset with insurmountable
difficulties in its working which were not brought to the attention of the Bench. With due respect,
such scheme is not within the spirit of the Act. As seen, the object is to regulate the contract labour
so long as the contract labour is not perennial. The labour is required to be paid the prescribed
wages and are provided with other welfare benefits envisaged under the Act under direct
supervision of the principal employer. The violation visits with penal consequences. Similarly, when
the appropriate Government finds that the employment is of perennial nature etc, contract system
Air India Statutory Corporation vs United Labour Union & Ors on 6 November, 1996

stand abolished, thereby, it intended that if the workmen were performing the duties of the post
which were found to be of perennial nature on par with regular service, they also require to be
regularised. The Act did not intend to denude them of their sources of livelihood and means of
development, throwing them out from employment. as held earlier, it is a socio-economic welfare
legislation. Right to socio-economic justice and empowerment are constitutional rights. right to
means of livelihood is also constitutional right. Right to facilities and opportunities are only part of
and means of livelihood and resultant right to life, leaving them in the lurch since prior to abolition,
they had the work and thereby earned livelihood. The Division Bench in Dena Nath's case has taken
too narrow a view on technical consideration without keeping at the back of the mind the
constitutional animations and the spirit of the provisions and the object which the Act seeks to
achieve. The operation so the Act is structured on an unbuilt procedure leaving no escape route.
Abolition of contract labour system ensures right to the workmen for regularisation of them as
employees in the establishment in which they were hitherto working as contract labour through the
contractor. The contractor stands removed from the regulation under the Act and direct relationship
of "employer and employee" is created between the principal employer and workmen. Gujarat
Electricity's case, being of the co-ordinate Bench, appears to have softened the rough edges of Dena
Nath's radio. The object of the Act is to prevent exploitation of labour. Section 7 and section 12
enjoin the principal employer and the contractor to register under the Act, to supply the number of
labour required by the principal employer through the contractor; to regulate their payment of
wages and conditions of serve and to provide welfare amenities, during subsistance of the contract
labour. The failure to get the principal employer and the contractor registered under the Act visits
with penal consequences under the Act. The object, thereby, is to ensure continuity of work to the
workmen in strict compliance of law. The conditions of the labour are not left at the whim and fancy
of the principal employer. He is bound under the Act to regulate and ensure payment of the full
wages, and also to provide all the amenities enjoined under Section 16 to 19 of the Act and the rules
made thereunder. On abolition of contract labour, the intermediary, i.e., contractor, is removed
from the field and direct linkage between labour and principal employer is established. Thereby, the
principal employer's obligation to absorb them arises. The right of the employee for absorption gets
ripened and fructified. If the interpretation in Dena Nath's case is given acceptance, it would be an
open field for the principal employer to freely flout the provisions of the Act and engage workmen in
defiance of the Act and adopt the principle of hire and fire making it possible to exploit the appalling
conditions in which the workmen are placed. The object of the Act, thereby gets rudely shattered
and the object of the Act easily defeated. Statutory obligations of holding valid licence by the
principal employer under Section 7 and by the contract under Section 12 is to ensure compliance of
the law. Dena Nath's ratio falls foul of the constitutional goals of the trinity; they are free launchers
to exploit the workmen. The contractor is an intermediary between the workmen and the principal
employer. The moment the contract labour system stands prohibited under Section 10(1), the
embargo to continue as a contract labour is put an end to and direct relationship has been provided
between the workmen and the principal employer. Thereby, the principal employer directly becomes
responsible for taking the services of the workmen hitherto regulated through the contractor. The
object of the penal provisions was to prevent the prohibition of the employer to commit breach of
the provisions of the act and to put an end to exploitation of the labour and to deter him from acting
in violation of constitutional right of the workmen to his decent standard of life, living, wages, right
to health etc. The founding fathers placed no limitation or fetters on the power of the High Court
Air India Statutory Corporation vs United Labour Union & Ors on 6 November, 1996
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/784921/
39
under Article 226 of the Constitution except self-imposed limitations. The arm of the Court is long
enough to reach injustice wherever it is found. The Court as reach injustice wherever it is found. The
court as sentinal in the qui vive is to mete out justice in given facts. On finding that either the
workmen were engaged in violation of the provisions of the Act or were continued as contract
labour, despite prohibition of the contract labour under Section 10(1), the High Court has, by
judicial review as the basic structure, constitutional duty to enforce the law by appropriate
directions. The right to judicial review is no a basic structure of the Constitution by catena of
decisions of this Court starting from Indira Gandhi vs. Raj Narayan [AIR 1975 SC 2299] and
Bommai's case. It would, therefore, be necessary that instead of leaving the workmen in the lurch,
the Court would properly mould the relief and grant the same in accordance with law.
The public law remedy given by 'Article 226 of the Constitution is to issue not only the prerogative
writs provided therein but also any order or direction to enforce any of the fundamental rights and
"for any other purpose". The distinction between public law and private law remedy by judicial
adjudication gradually marginalished and became obliterated. In L.I.C. v. Escort Ltd. & Ors. [(1986)
1 SCC 264 at 344]. this Court in paragraph 102 and pointed out that the difficulty will lie in
demarcating the frontier between the public law domain and the private law field. The question
must be decided in each case with reference to the particular action, the activity in which the State
or the instrumentality of the State is engaged when performing the action, the public law or private
law character of the question and the host of other relevant circumstances. Therein, the question
was whether the management of LIC should record reasons for accepting the purchase of the
shares? It was in that fact situation that his court held that there was no need to state reasons when
the management of the shareholders buy resolution reached the decision. This court equally pointed
out in other cases that when the State's power as economic power and economic entrepreneur and
allocator of economic benefits is subject to the limitations of fundamental rights, a private
Corporation under the functional control of the State engaged in an activity hazardous to the health
and safety of the community, is imbued with public interest which the State ultimately proposes to
regulate exclusively on its industrial policy. It would also be subject to the same limitation as held in
M.C. Mehta & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.[(1987) 1 SCC 395].
The legal right of an individual may be founded upon a contract or a statue or an instrument having
the force of law. For a public law remedy enforceable under Article 226 of the Constitution, the
action of the authority need to fall in the realm of public law-be it a legislative act of the State, an
executive act of the State or an instrumentality or a person or authority imbued with public law
element. The question requires to be determined in each case. However, it may not be possible to
generalise the nature of the action which would come either under public law remedy or private law
field nor is it desirable to give exhaustive list of such actions. As held by this Court in Calcutta Gas
Co. Ltd. v. State of West Bengal [Air 1961 SC 1044, para 5] that if the legal right of a Manager of
company is denuded on the basis of recommendation by the Board of Management of the company,
it would give him right to enforce his right by filling a writ petition under Article 226 of the
Constitution. In Mulchand v. State of M.P. [AIR 1968 SC 1218], this court had held that even though
the contract was void due to non-compliance of Article 229, still direction could be given for
payment of the amount on the doctrine of restitution under Section 70 of the Act, since the had
derived benefit under the void contract. The same view was reiterated in State of West Bengal v. V.K.

Mandal & SOrs. [AIR 1962 SC 779 of 789] and in New Marine Coal Co. Ltd, v. Union of India [(1964)
2 SCR 859]. In Gujarat State Financial Corporation. v. Lotus Hotel [(1983) 3 SCC 370], a direction
was issued a to release loan to the respondent to comply with the contractual obligation by applying
the doctrine of promissory estoppel. In Mahabir Auto Store v. Indian Oil Corporation. [(1990) 3 SCC
752], contractual obligation were enforced under public law remedy of Article 226 against the
instrumentality of the State. In Shreelekha Vidyarthi v. State of U.P. [(1991) 1 SCC 212] contractual
obligations were enforced when public law element was involved, Same Judicial approach is
adopted in other jurisdictions, namely, the House of Lords in Gillic v. West Norfolk and Wisbech
Area health Authority [(1986) AC 112] wherein the House of Lords held that though the claim of the
plaintiff was negatived but on the anvil of power of judicial review, it was held that the public law
content of the claim was so great as to make her case an exception to the general rule. Similarly in
Dr. Roy v. Kensinstone and Chelsea Family Practioners Committee [(1992) IAC 624], the House of
Lords reiterated that though a matter of private law is enforceable by ordinary actions, a court also
is free from the constraints of judicial review and that public law remedy is available when the
remuneration of Dr. Roy was sought to be curtailed. In L.I.C. v. Consumer Education and Research
Centre & Ors. [(1995) 5 SCC 482], this court held that each case may be examined on its facts and
circumstances to find out the nature and scope of the controversy. The distinction between public
law and private law remedy has now become thin and practically obliterated.
In write petitions filed under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, the petitioners, in R.K. Panda
vs. Steel Authority of India & Ors. [(1994) 5 SCC 304], contended that they had been working in
Rourkela plant of the Steel authority of India for period ranging between 10 and 20 years as contract
labour. The employment was of perennial nature. The non-regularisation defeated their right to a
job. The change of contractors under the terms of the agreement will not have any effect o their
continuing as a contract labour of the predecessor contractors. The respondent contended that due
to modernisation of the industry, the contract labour are likely to be retrenched. The were prepared
to allow the contract labour to retire on voluntary basis or to be absorbed for local employment. A
Bench of three judges of this court had held that the contract labour were continuing the
employment of the respondent for last 10 years, in spite of change of contractors, and hence they
were directed to b e absorbed as regular employees. On such absorption, their inter se seniority be
determined, department or job-wise, on the basis of continuous employment; regular wags will be
payable only for the period subsequent to absorption and not for the period prior thereto. Such of
those contract labour is respect of whom the rate of wages have not been fixed, the minimum, rate of
wages would be payable to such workmen of the wages of the regular employees. The establishment
was further directed to pay the wages. If the staff is found in excess of the requirement, the direction
for regularisation would not stand in their way to reached the workmen in accordance with law. If
there arises any dispute as regards the identification of the contract labour to be absorbed, the Chief
Labour Commissioner, Central Government, on evidence, would go into that question. The
retrenched employees shall also be entitled to the benefit of the decision. The 10 years period
mentioned by the Court would count to calculate retrenchment benefits. This also of there being no
report by the Advisory Board under section 10(2) and no prohibition under section 10(1), the Act
was enforced and this Court directed to absorb them within the guidelines laid down in the
judgment. This ratio also is an authority for the proposition that the jurisdiction of the court under
Article 32, pari materia with Article 226 which is much a wider than Article 32 " for any other
Air India Statutory Corporation vs United Labour Union & Ors on 6 November, 1996

41
purpose" under which suitable directions are required to have given based on factual background.
Therein the need to examine the correctness of Dena Nath's radio did not arise nor is it a case of
abolition of contract labour. So, its reference appears to be as a statement if laying the law in Dena
Nath's case.
Prior to the Act came into force, in The standard- Vacuum Refining Co. of India vs. Its Workmen &
Ors. [(1960 3 SCR 466], a Bench of three judges of this court had held that the contract labour, on
reference under section 10 of the ID Act was required to be regularised, after the industrial disputes
was adjudicated, under section 2(k) of the ID Act. Since workmen had substantial interest in the
dispute, it was held that the direction issued b the Tribunal that the contract labour should be
abolished was held just in the circumstances of the case and should be abolished was held just in the
circumstances of the case\and should to be interfered with. In other words, this court upheld the
jurisdiction of Tribunal after deciding the dispute as an industrial dispute and gage direction to
abolish the contract labour. The Power of the Court is not fettered by the absence of any statutory
prohibition.
In Security Guards Board for Greater Bombay and Thane District vs. Security & Personnel Service
Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. [(1987) 3 SCC 413], the question as regards absorption of security guards employed
in any factory or establishment etc. under Maharashtra Private Security Guards (Regulation of
Employment and welfare) Act, 1981 had come up for consideration. It was held that the exemption
under Section 23 is in regard to the security guards employed in the factory or establishment or in
any class or classes of fabricating factory's establishment. The co-relationship of the security guards
of classes of security guards who may be exempted for the operation of the Act is with the factory or
establishment sin which they work and not with agency or agent through and by whom they were
employed. In other words., the ratio of that case is that it is not material as to through which
contractor the employee came to be appointed or such labour came to be engaged in the
establishment concerned. The direct relationship would emerge after the abolition of the contract
labour. In Sankar Mukherjee & Ors. vs. Union of India & Ors. [ AIR 1990 SC 532], the State
Government exercising the power under Section 10 of the Act prohibited employment of contract
labour in cleaning and stacking and other allied jobs in the brick department. Loading and
unloading of bricks from wagons and trucks was not abolished. Writ petition under Article 32 of the
Constitution of India was filed. A Bench of three judges of this court had held that the act requires to
be construed liberally so as to effectuate the object of the act. The bricks transportation to the
factory, loading and unloading are continuous process; therefore, all the jobs are incidental to or
allied to each other. All the workmen performing these jobs were to be treated alike. Loading and
unlading job and the other jobs were of perennial nature. There fore, there was no justification to
exclude the job of loading and unloading of bricks from wagons and trucks from the purview of the
notification dated February 9, 1980. Thus, this Court had given direction to abolish the contract
labour system and to absorb the employees working in loading and unloading the bricks which is of
perennial nature. In National Federation of Railway Porters, Vendors & Bearers vs. Union of India &
Ors. [(1995) 3 SCC 152], a Bench of two judges to which one of us (K. Ramaswamy, J.) was a
member, was to consider whether the Railway Parcel Porters working in the different railway
stations were contract labour for several years, when they filed write petition, the Central Assistant
Labour commissioner was directed to enquire and find out whether the job is of a permanent and

42
perennial nature and whether the petitioners were working for a long period. On receipt of the
report, with findings in favour of favour of workers, the Bench had directed the Railway
Administration to Regularise them into the service. This case also is an authority for the proposition
that in an appropriate case the Court can give suitable directions to the competent authority,
namely, central labour Commissioner to enquire and submit a report. The perennial nature of the
work and other related aspect are required to be complied with before directions are given under of
Section 10(1) and 10(2) of the Act. On receipt of the report, the Court could mould the relief in an
appropriate manner to meet the given situation. In Praga Tools case, this Court held that mandamus
may be issued to enforce duties and positive obligation of a public nature even though the persons
or the authorities are not public officials or authorities. The same view was laid in Anadi Mukta v.
V.R. Rudani [(1989) 2 SCC 691] and Unni Krishna v. State of A.P. [(1993) 1 SCC 645]. In
Comptroller & Auditor General of India v. K.S. Jagannathan [(1986) 2 SCC 679], this court held that
a mandamus would be issued to implement Directive Principles when Government have adopted
them. They are under public obligations to give preferential treatment implementing the rule of
reservation under Articles 14 and 16 (1) and (4) of the Constitution. In L.I.C. case, directions were
issued to frame policies accessible to common man.
Thus, we hold that though there is no express provision in the Act for absorption of the employees
whose contract labour system stood abolished by publication of the notification under section 10 (1)
of the Act, in a proper case, the court as sentinal in the qui vive is required to direct the appropriate
authority to act in accordance with law and submit a report to the court and based thereon proper
relief should be granted.
It is true that learned counsel for the appellant had given alternative proposal, but after going
through its contents, were are of the view that the proposal would defeat, more often than not, the
purpose of the Act and keep the workmen at the whim of the establishment. The request of the
learned Solicitor General that the management may be left with that discretion so as to absorb the
workmen cannot be accepted. In this behalf, it is necessary to recapitulate that on abolition of the
contract labour system, by necessary implication, the principal employer is under statutory
obligation to absorb the contract labour. The linkage between the contractor and the employee stood
snapped and direct relationship stood restored between principal employer and the contract labour
as its employees. Considered from this perspective, all the workmen in the respective services
working on contract labour are required to be absorbed in the establishment of the appellant.
Though there exists no specific scale of pay to be paid as regular employees, it is for the
establishment to take such steps as are necessary to prescribe scale of pay like class 'D' employees.
There is no impediment in the way of the appellants to absorb them in the last grade, namely, grade
IV employees on regular basis. It is seen that the criteria to abolish the contract labour system is the
duration of the work, the number of employees working on the job etc. That would be the indicia to
absorb the employees on regular basis. It is seen that the criteria to abolish the contract labour
system is the duration of the work, the number of employes working on the job etc. That would be
the indicia to absorb the employees on regular basis in the respective services in the establishment.
Therefore, the date of engagement will be the criteria to determine their inter se seniority. In case,
there would be any need for retrenchment of any excess staff, necessarily, the principle of "last
come, first go" should be applied subject to his reappointment as and when the vacancy arises.

Therefore, there is no impediment in the way of the appellants to adopt the above procedure. The
award proceedings as suggested in Gujarat Electricity Board case are beset with several
incongruities and obstacles in the way of the contract labour for immediate absorption. Since, the
contract labour gets into the service of the principal employer, the Union of the existing employees
may not espouse their cause for reference under section 10 of the ID Act. The workmen, who no
abolition of contract labour system have no right to seek reference under section of 10 of ID Act.
Moreover, the workmen immediately are kept out of job to endlessly keep waiting for award and
thereafter resulting in further litigation and delay in enforcement. The management would always
keep them at by for absorption. it would be difficult for them to work out their right. Moreover, it is
a trade and time-consuming process and years would role by. Without wages, they cannot keep
fighting the litigation endlessly. The right and remedy would be a teasing illusion and would be
rendered otiose and practically compelling the workman at the mercy of the principal employer.
Considered from this pragmatic perspective, with due respect to the learned judges, the remedy
valuable assistance given by all the learned counsel in the appeals.
The appeals are accordingly dismissed, but in the circumstances, without costs.
