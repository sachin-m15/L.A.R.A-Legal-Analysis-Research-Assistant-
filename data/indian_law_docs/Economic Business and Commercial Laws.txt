EXECUTIVE PROGRAMME 
ECONOMIC, BUSINESS AND COMMERCIAL LAWS  
 
India redrafted its economic policy to usher in a new era of deregulation, liberalisation and global 
integration. Since then significant policy initiatives have been introduced, to provide stimulus for 
accelerated growth, industrial efficiency and international competitiveness. As part of reform process, the 
Government has also initiated legislative reforms in the area of Economic, Business and Commercial 
laws. The Government enacted Foreign Exchange Management Act, The Competition Act, 2002, Real 
Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 and amended Benami Transaction Prohibitions Act. 
Further, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act to deal with new categories of economic offences, has 
also been enacted. Similarly, in the area of consumer protection and business laws, the process of 
reforms is going on. 
In the light of above developments, this study material has been prepared to provide an 
understanding of certain Economic, Business and Commercial legislations which have direct bearing on 
the functioning of companies. The study material has been divided into three parts consisting of twenty 
four study lessons.  Part I dealing with Foreign Exchange Management & NBFCs consists of Study 
Lessons I to XI, whereas Part II dealing with Competition Laws consists of Study Lesson XIIand Part III 
dealing with Business & Commercial Laws consists of Study Lessons XIII to XXIV. 
This study material has been published to aid the students in preparing for the Economic, Business 
and Commercial Laws paper of the CS Executive Programme. It has been prepared to provide basic 
understanding of some of the Economic, Business and Commercial laws thereunder, which have a 
bearing on the conduct of corporate affairs. It is part of the educational kit and takes the students step by 
step through each phase of preparation stressing key concepts, principle, pointers and procedures. 
Company Secretaryship being a professional course, the examination standards are set very high, with 
emphasis on knowledge of concepts, applications, procedures and case laws, for which sole reliance on 
the contents of this study material may not be enough. Besides, as per the Company Secretaries 
Regulations, 1982, students are expected to be conversant with the amendments to the laws made upto 
six months preceding the date of examination. The material may, therefore, be regarded as the basic 
material and must be read alongwith the original Bare Acts, Rules, Regulations, Case Law, Chartered  
Secretary Journal published by the Institute every month . 
The subject of Economic, Business and Commercial Laws is inherently complicated and is subjected 
to constant refinement through new primary legislations, rules and regulations made thereunder and court 
decisions on specific legal issues. It, therefore becomes necessary for every student to constantly update 
himself with the various legislative changes made as well as judicial pronouncements rendered from time 
to time by referring to the Institute’s journal ‘Chartered Secretary’ and e-bulletin  as well as other 
law/professional journals. 
In the event of any doubt, students may write to the Directorate of Professional Development, 
Perspective Planning & Studies of the Institute for clarification at academics@icsi.edu. 
Although care has been taken in publishing this study material yet the possibility of errors, omissions 
and/or discrepancies cannot be ruled out. This publication is released with an understanding that the 
Institute shall not be responsible for any errors, omissions and/or discrepancies or any action taken in that 
behalf. 
Should there be any discrepancy, error or omission noted in the study material, the Institute shall be 
obliged if the same is brought to its notice for issue of corrigendum in the e-bulletin.

Lesson 17 -  Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 
Parliament enacted the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 which aims at protecting the 
rights  and interests of consumers  and  promotion  of  uniformity  and standardization  of  business  
practices  and transactions in the real estate sector. It attempts to balance the interests of consumers and 
promoters by imposing certain responsibilities on both.  It seeks to establish symmetry of information 
between the promoter and purchaser, transparency of contractual conditions, set minimum standards of 
accountability and a fast-track dispute resolution mechanism. 
As per Section 56 of the Act, the applicant or appellant may either appear in person or authorise one or 
more chartered accountants  or company  secretaries or  cost  accountants  or  legal  practitioners  or  
any  of  its  officers  to  present  his  or  its case before the Appellate Tribunal or the Regulatory Authority 
or the adjudicating officer, as the case may be. 
The objective of the lesson is to introduce the students regarding: 
• Registration of Real Estate Project; 
• Real Estate Agents; 
• Real Estate Regulatory Authority; 
• The Real Estate Appellate Tribunal; and  
• Specimen Agreement for Sale between the Promoter and the Allottee; Due Diligence Reporting. 
ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS 
Lesson 18 - Benami Transaction Prohibitions (Act) 
Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 defines benami transaction and benami property and also 
provides for exclusions and transactions which shall not be construed benami. The  legislation  is  also  
intended  to  effectively  prohibit  benami  transactions  and  consequently  prevent circumvention of law 
through unfair practices. It empowers the Government to confiscate benami property by following due 
procedure. It therefore promotes equity across all citizens. 
The purpose of this lesson is to provide the students with: 
• Benami Property; 
• Benami Transaction; 
• Prohibition of Benami Transaction; and 
• Adjudication of Benami property. 
Lesson 19 - Prevention of Money Laundering 
The possible social and political costs of money laundering, if left unchecked or dealt with ineffectively, 
are serious.  Organised crime can infiltrate financial institutions, acquire control of large sectors of the 
economy through investment, or offer bribes to public officials and indeed governments.  The economic 
 
(xviii) 
and political influence of criminal organisations can weaken the social  fabric,  collective  ethical  
standards,  and  ultimately  the  democratic  institutions  of  society. In countries transitioning to 
democratic systems, this criminal influence can undermine the transition.  Most  fundamentally,  money 
laundering  is  inextricably  linked  to  the  underlying  criminal  activity  that  generated  it.  Laundering 
enables criminal activity to continue. 
The Prevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002 enacted to prevent money laundering and to provide for 
confiscation of property derived from, or involved in, money laundering and for matters connected 
therewith or incidental thereto. 
The objective of the lesson is to introduce the students regarding: 
• Problem and adverse effect of money laundering; 
• Methods of money laundering; 
• Offence of money laundering; and  
• Attachment, adjudication and confiscation. 
BUSINESS LAWS 
Lesson 20 - Indian Contracts Act, 1872 
The Law of Contract constitutes the most important branch of Mercantile or Commercial Law. It affects 
everybody, more so, trade, commerce and industry. It may be said that the contract is the foundation of 
the modern world. The Indian Contract Act, 1872 regulates all the transactions of a company. 
• It lays down the general principles relating to  the  formation  and enforceability  of  contracts; rules  
governing  the provisions  of  an  agreement  and  offer; 
• Various types of contracts including those of indemnity and guarantee, bailment and pledge and 
agency; and 
• It also contains provisions pertaining to breach of a contract. 
Lesson 21 - Specific Relief Act, 1963 
The Specific Relief Act, 1963 was enacted to define and amend the law relating to certain kinds of 
specific relief. It contains provisions, inter alia, specific performance of contracts, contracts not specifically 
enforceable, parties who may obtain and against whom specific performance may be obtained, etc. It also 
confers wide discretionary powers upon the courts to decree specific performance and to refuse 
injunction, etc. 
It is expected that, at the end of this lesson, students will, inter alia, be in a position to:  
• Understand specific reliefs and defense; 
• Specific performance and defense; 
• Unenforceable contracts; and 
• Know Decrees and Preventive Reliefs. 
Lesson 22-Sale of Goods Act, 1930 
The law relating to sale of goods is contained in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. In  a  sale,  the  property  in  
(xix) 
the  goods  sold  passes  to  the  buyer  at  the  time  of  contract  so  that  he becomes the owner of the 
goods. In an agreement to sell, the ownership does not pass to the buyer at the time of the contract, but it 
passes only when it becomes sale on the expiry of certain time or the fulfillment of some conditions 
subject to which the property in the goods is to be transferred. 
The purpose of this lesson is to provide the students with:  
• Essentials of a Contract of Sale; 
• Sale Distinguished from Agreement to Sell; 
• Bailment; 
• Conditions and Warranties; and 
• Doctrine of Caveat Emptor. 
Lesson 23 - Partnership Act, 1932 
"Partnership" is the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried 
on by all or any of them acting for all. Persons who have entered into partnership with one another are 
called individually, "partners" and collectively "a firm", and the name under which their business is carried 
on is called the "firm-name”. In determining whether a group of persons is or is not a firm, or whether a 
person is or is not a partner in a firm, regard shall be had to the real relation between the parties, as 
shown by all relevant facts taken together. 
It is expected that, at the end of this lesson, students will, inter alia, be in a position to:  
• Understand Rights and Liabilities of Partners; 
• Registration of Firms; 
• Admission of new partners; and 
• Dissolution of Firms and Partnership. 
Lesson 24 - Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 
A negotiable instrument may be defined as an instrument, the property in which is acquired by anyone 
who takes it bona fide, and for value, notwithstanding any defect of title in the person from whom he took 
it, from which it follows that an instrument cannot be negotiable unless it is such and in such a state that 
the true owner could transfer the contract or engagement contained therein by simple delivery of 
instrument. 
The objective of the lesson is to introduce the students regarding: 
• Negotiable Instruments and Parties; 
• Effect of Negotiability; 
• Crossing and bouncing of Cheques; 
• Dishonour of Cheques & its Remedies; and 
• Presumption of Law as to Negotiable Instruments.

INTRODUCTION 
The origin of the Reserve Bank of India can be traced back to 1926, when the Royal Commission on Indian 
Currency and Finance – also known as the Hilton-Young Commission – recommended the creation of a 
central bank for India to separate the control of currency and credit from the Government and to augment 
banking facilities throughout the country. The Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 established the Reserve Bank 
and set in motion a series of actions culminating in the start of operations in 1935. Since then, the Reserve 
Bank’s role and functions have undergone numerous changes, as the nature of Indian economy and financial 
sector changed. 
Starting as a private shareholders’ bank, the Reserve Bank was nationalized in 1949. It then assumed the 
responsibility to meet the aspirations of a newly independent country and its people. The Reserve Bank’s 
nationalisation aimed at achieving coordination between the policies of the government and those of central 
bank. 
The Preamble to the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (the Act), under which it was constituted, specifies its 
objective as “to regulate the issue of Bank notes and the keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary 
stability in India and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its advantage”. 
The objectives outlined in the Preamble hold good. As evident from the multifaceted functions that the 
Reserve Bank performs today, its role and priorities have, changed in tandem with national priorities and 
global developments. Essentially, the Reserve Bank has demonstrated dynamism and flexibility to meet the 
requirements of an evolving economy. 
A core function of the Reserve Bank in the past years has been the formulation and implementation of 
monetary policy with the objective of maintaining price stability and ensuring adequate flow of credit to 
productive sectors of the economy. To these was added, in more recent times, the goal of maintaining 
financial stability. The objective of maintaining financial stability has spanned its role from external account 
management to oversight of banks and non-banking financial institutions as also of money, government 
securities and foreign exchange markets. 
The Reserve Bank designs and implements the regulatory policy framework for banking and non-banking 
financial institutions with the aim of providing people access to the banking system, protecting depositors’ 
interest, and maintaining overall health of the financial system. Its function of regulating the commercial 
banking sector, which emerged with the enactment of Banking Regulation Act, 1949, has over the time, 
expanded to cover other entities. Thus, amendments to Banking Regulation Act, 1949 brought cooperative 
banks and regional rural banks under the Reserve Bank’s jurisdiction, while amendments to the Reserve 
Bank of India Act saw development finance institutions, non-banking financial companies and primary 
dealers coming under its regulation, as these entities became important players in the financial system and 
markets. 
Similarly, the global economic uncertainties during and after the Second World War warranted conservation 
of scarce foreign exchange reserves by sovereign intervention and allocation. Initially, the Reserve Bank 
carried out regulation of foreign exchange transactions under the Defence of India Rules, 1939 and later, 
under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act of 1947. Over the years, as the economy matured, the role 
shifted from foreign exchange regulation to foreign exchange management. 
Post-independence, as the emerging nation tried to meet the aspirations of a large and diversified populace, 
the Reserve Bank, with its experience and expertise, was entrusted with a variety of developmental roles, 
particularly in the field of credit delivery. With the onset of economic planning in 1950-51, the Reserve Bank 
undertook a variety of developmental functions to encourage savings and capital formation and widen and 
deepen the agricultural and industrial credit set-up. Institution building was a significant aspect of its role in 
the sixties and the seventies. The strategy for nearly four decades placed emphasis on the state-induced or 
state-supported developmental efforts. Subsequently, the role of financial sector and financial markets was 
                                                                         Lesson 1          Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934

also given an explicit recognition in the development strategy. 
The aftermath of 1991 balance of payments and foreign exchange crisis saw a paradigm shift in India’s 
economic and financial policies. The approach under the reform era included a thrust towards liberalisation, 
privatisation, globalisation and concerted efforts at strengthening the existing and emerging institutions and 
market participants. The Reserve Bank adopted international best practices in areas, such as, prudential 
regulation, banking technology, variety of monetary policy instruments, external sector management and 
currency management to make the new policy framework effective. 
The rapid pace of growth achieved by the financial system in deregulated regime necessitated a deepening 
and widening of access to banking services. The new millennium has seen the Reserve Bank play an active 
role in balancing the relationship between banks and customers; focusing on financial inclusion; setting up 
administrative machinery to handle customer grievances; pursuing clean note policy and ensuring 
development and oversight of secure and robust payment and settlement systems. 
The last two-and-a-half decades have also seen growing integration of national economy and financial 
system with the globalising world. While rising global integration has its advantages in terms of expanding 
the scope and scale of growth of the Indian economy, it also exposes India to global shocks. Hence, 
maintaining financial stability became an important mandate for the Reserve Bank. This, in turn, has brought 
forth the need for effective coordination and consultation with other regulators within the country and abroad.

ESTABLISHMENT AND INCORPORATION OF RESERVE BANK 
Section 3 of the RBI Act states that a bank to be called the Reserve Bank of India shall be constituted for the 
purposes of taking over the management of the currency from the Central Government and of carrying on 
the business of banking in accordance with the provisions of the Act. 
Sub section (2) of this section provides that the Bank shall be a body corporate by the name of Reserve 
Bank of India, having perpetual succession and a common seal, and shall by the said name sue and be 
sued. 
ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE & MANAGEMENT 
 
The organizational structure of RBI can be classified under the following designations: 
  
 
 
         Central Board of Directors 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CENTRAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
The Central Board of Directors is at the top of the Reserve Bank’s organisational structure. Appointed by the 
Government under the provisions of Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Central Board has the primary 
authority and responsibility for the oversight of Reserve Bank. It delegates specific functions to the Local 
Boards and various committees. The Governor is the Reserve Bank’s chief executive.  
                                                                         Lesson 1          Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934                                   
5 
The Governor supervises and directs the affairs and business of RBI. The management team also includes 
Deputy Governors and Executive Directors.  
The Central Government nominates fourteen Directors on the Central Board, including one Director each 
from the four Local Boards. The other ten Directors represent different sectors of the economy, such as, 
agriculture, industry, trade, and professions. All these appointments are made for a period of four years. The 
Government also nominates one Government official as a Director representing the Government, who is 
usually the Finance Secretary to the Government of India and remains on the Board ‘during the pleasure of 
the Central Government’.  
The Governor and Deputy Governors devote their whole time to the affairs of the Bank, and receive such 
salaries and allowances as may be determined by the Central Board, with the approval of the Central 
Government [Section 8(2)] 
The Deputy Governor and the Director nominated may attend any meeting of the Central Board and take 
part in its deliberations but shall not be entitled to vote. However when the Governor is, for any reason, 
unable to attend any such meeting, a Deputy Governor authorized by him in this behalf in writing may vote 
for him at that meeting. [Section 8(3)] 
The Governor and a Deputy Governor hold the office for such term not exceeding five years as the Central 
Government may fix when appointing them, and they are eligible for re-appointment. A Director nominated 
holds the office for a period of four years and thereafter until his successor is nominated. [Section 8(4)] 
No act or proceeding of the Board can be questioned on the ground merely of the existence of any vacancy 
in, or any defect in the constitution, of the board. [Section 8(5)] 
A retiring director shall be eligible for re-nomination. [Section 8(7)] 
Local Boards 
The Reserve Bank Governor and a maximum of four Deputy Governors are also ex officio Directors on the 
Central Board. The Reserve Bank also has four Local Boards, constituted by the Central Government under 
the RBI Act, one each for the Western, Eastern, Northern and Southern areas of the country, which are 
located in Mumbai, Kolkata, New Delhi and Chennai. Each of these Boards has five members appointed by 
the Central Government for a term of four years and thereafter until his successor is appointed. They are 
eligible for re-appointment [Section 9(3)]. The members of the Local Board shall elect from amongst 
themselves one person to be the Chairman of the Board. [Section 9(2)]. These Boards represent territorial 
and economic interests of their respective areas, and advise the Central Board on matters, such as, issues 
relating to local cooperative and indigenous banks. They also perform other functions that the Central Board 
may delegate to them. [Section 9(1)] 
Offices and Branches 
The Reserve Bank has a network of offices and branches through which it discharges its responsibilities. The 
units operating in the four metros — Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi and Chennai — are known as offices, while the 
units located at other cities and towns are called branches. Currently, the Reserve Bank has its offices, 
including branches, at 27 locations in India. The offices and larger branches are headed by a senior officer of 
the rank of Chief General Manager, designated as Regional Director while smaller branches are headed by a 
senior officer of the rank of General Manager.

FUNCTIONS OF THE RESERVE BANK 
The statutes governing the establishment and mandates of central banks play a crucial role in  determining  
their functions across the world.  The RBI has been constituted under the Reserve Bank of India (RBI Act, 
1934).  The legal backing for the functions  of  the RBI is not only confined  to the provisions of the RBI  Act, 
but also spread over a number of statutes, such as the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, Foreign Exchange 
Management Act, 1999, Government Securities  Act,  2006,  Payment  and  Settlement  Systems  Act,  2007,  
etc. 
The purposes for which the Reserve Bank of India established as India's central bank have been spelt out in 
the preamble to the RBI Act, which states as follows: 
 
(i) to regulate the issue of banknotes and the keeping of reserves with a view to  securing monetary  
stability in India and generally  to  operate the currency  and  credit system of  the country to its 
advantage; and 
 
(ii)  that it  is essential to have a modern monetary policy framework  to  meet the challenge  of  an  
increasingly complex  economy: the  primary  objective of the monetary policy is  to maintain price 
stability while keeping in mind the objective of  growth and the monetary policy framework in India 
shall be operated by the Reserve Bank of India . 
The functions of the Reserve Bank of India can be summarized as under: 
 Banking Functions 
 Issue bank notes 
 Monetary Policy Functions 
 Public Debt Functions 
 Foreign Exchange Management 
 Banking Regulation & Supervision 
 Regulation and Supervision of NBFCs 
 Regulation & Supervision of Co-operative banks 
 Regulation of Derivatives and Money Market Instruments 
 Payment and Settlement Functions 
 Consumer Protection Functions 
 Financial Inclusion and Development Functions 
Banking Functions 
The general superintendence and direction of the affairs and business of RBI is entrusted to Central Board 
having nominees from the Central Government and Directors appointed under Section 8 of the RBI Act. The 
Board of RBI is headed by the Governor and assisted by not more than four Deputy Governors.  
The  Board exercises all powers and does  all  acts  and  things  which  may  be exercised  by  the  RBI.  
Section 17 of the RBI Act  enables RBI to do banking business, such as accepting deposits, without  interest, 
from any person. The other businesses, which the RBI may transact, are also mentioned in the said 
                                                                         Lesson 1          Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934

provision. It states that RBI may transact various businesses such as acceptance of deposits without interest 
from Central Government and State Governments, purchase, sale and rediscount of Bills of Exchange, short 
term Loans and Advances to banks, annual Contributions to National Rural Credit Funds, dealing in 
Derivatives, purchase and sale of Government Securities, purchase and sale of shares of  State Bank of  
India, National Housing Bank, Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation, etc., keeping of 
deposits with  SBI  for  specific purposes, making  and issue of Banknotes, etc. 
Similarly, Section 18 facilitates the RBI to  act as a 'Lender of  Last Resort'; whereas Section 19 states the 
list of  businesses which the RBI may not transact.  This apart, the provisions of RBI Act enables the RBI to 
act as banker to Central Government and State Governments. Under Sections 20 and 21 the RBI shall  have 
an obligation and right respectively to accept monies for account of Central Government and to make 
payments up  to  the amount standing to the credit of its account, and to carry out its exchange, remittance 
and other banking operations, including the management of public debt of the Union. In the case of State 
Governments, the said banking functions may be undertaken by way of an agreement between RBI and the 
State Government concerned as provided in Section 21-A of RBI Act. These agreements made between the 
RBI and the  State  Governments are statutory  as  they are required to be laid before the Parliament as  
soon as they are made. 
Issue Functions 
Right to issue bank notes is one of the key central banking functions of the RBI. Section 22 of RBI Act 
confers RBI with sole right to issue bank notes in India.  The issue function of bank notes is performed by the 
Issue Department, which is separated and kept wholly distinct from Banking Department. The RBI Act 
enables the RBI to recommend to Central Government the denomination of bank notes, i.e. two rupees, five 
rupees, ten rupees, twenty rupees, fifty rupees, one hundred rupees, five hundred rupees, one thousand 
rupees, two thousand rupees, five thousand rupees and ten thousand rupees or other denominations not 
exceeding ten thousand rupees. 
The design, form and material of bank notes is approved by Central Government on the recommendations of 
Central Board of the RBI. Every bank note is a legal tender at any place in India, however, on 
recommendation of the Central  Board, the  Central Government may declare  any  series  of  bank notes of  
any  denomination as not to be  a  legal  tender.  Another important function is exchange of mutilated or torn 
notes, which under the RBI Act is not a matter of right, but a matter of grace. The bank notes  that are being 
issued by RBI are exempt from  payment of stamp  duty . 
Monetary Policy Function 
Chapter III-F of the RBI Act provides a statutory basis for Monetary Policy Framework and the Monetary 
Policy Committee (MPC).  The Central Government, in consultation with the RBI shall determine the inflation 
target in terms of the Consumer Price Index, once in every five years, which needs to be notified in the 
Official Gazette. Similarly, it is the Central Government that should constitute a Monetary Policy Committee 
by notification in the Official Gazette. 
The Monetary Policy Committee consists of 
 
(a) the Governor  of the RBI; 
 
(b) Deputy Governor of the RBI in charge of Monetary Policy; 
 
(c) one officer of the RBI to be  nominated by the Central Board; and 
 
(d) three  persons  to  be  appointed  by  the  Central  Government . 
EP-EBCL 
8 
The Monetary Policy Committee has been entrusted with the statutory duty to determine the Policy Rate 
required to achieve the inflation target.  The decision of the Monetary Policy Committee is binding on RBI 
and the RBI is required publish a document explaining the steps to be taken to implement the decisions of 
the Monetary Policy Committee.  The meetings of the MPC are required to be held at least 4 times a  year 
and its decisions to be published after each meeting. 
Public Debt Functions 
The Parliament of India enacted the Government Securities Act, 2006 ('GS Act') with  an  objective to 
consolidate and amend the law relating to Government securities and its management by the  Reserve Bank 
of  India.  The GS Act applies to Government securities created and issued by the Central Government or a 
State Government. The GS Act prescribes the procedure and modalities to be followed by RBI in the 
management of public debt and also confers various powers on RBI including the power to determine the 
title to a Government security if there exists any doubt in the opinion of RBI.  Further, Section 18 of the GS 
Act provides that no order made by RBI under this Act shall be called in question by any Court for the 
reasons stated therein. Prior to the enactment of GS Act, the said public debt functions of the RBI have been 
governed under the provisions of Public Debt Act, 1944. However, the enactment of the GS Act has not fully 
repealed the Public Debt Act, 1944.  This is evident from  Section 31 of  the GS Act which states that the 
Public Debt Act, 1944, shall cease to apply to the Government securities to which this Act (GS Act) applies. 
Foreign Exchange Management 
The powers and responsibilities with respect to external trades and payments, development  and  
maintenance of foreign exchange market in India have been conferred on RBI under the provisions of 
Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 ('FEMA').  Section 10 of the FEMA empowers the RBI to authorize 
any person to be known as authorized person to deal in foreign exchange or in foreign securities, as an 
authorized dealer, money changer or off-shore banking unit or in any other manner as it deems fit. Similarly, 
FEMA empowers the RBI to revoke an authorization issued to an authorized dealer in  public interest, or if 
the authorized person has failed to comply with the conditions subject to which the authorization was granted 
or has contravened any of the  provisions of the FEMA or any rule, regulation, notification, direction or order 
issued by the RBI. However, the revocation of an authorization may be done by the RBI after following the 
prescribed procedure in FEMA or the Regulations made thereunder.  Section 13 of the FEMA details out the 
contraventions and penalties, and the  RBI has been  empowered with the power to compound  such 
contraventions under Section 15 of the FEMA. 
Banking Regulation & Supervision 
The  power to regulate and supervise banks has been  provided to RBI under the provisions of Banking  
Regulation Act, 1949 (BR Act, 1949). Although, the preamble to the BR Act, 1949, states that it is  an Act to 
consolidate and amend the law relating to banking, the powers of RBI to formulate banking policy, regulate 
banking business, protect the interests  of banking companies, supervision of banking companies, etc., are 
spread across the provisions of BR Act, 1949. 
Firstly, Section 5(ca) of the BR  Act, 1949, states that banking policy means any policy, which is specified 
from time to time by the RBI, in the interest of banking system or in the interest of monetary stability or sound 
economic growth, having due regard to the interests of the depositors, the volume of deposits and other 
resources of the bank and the need for equitable allocation and  the  efficient use of these deposits and 
resources.  
Secondly, as a  part of RBI's regulatory power, Section 10BB of the BR Act, 1949 empowers RBI to appoint a 
                                                                         Lesson 1          Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934                                   
9 
Chairman or Managing Director of  a banking company for the reasons stated therein.  Similarly, as a part of 
control over management, Section 36-AB of BR Act, 1949, provides for power to appoint additional directors 
on the boards of banking companies. Not only the powers to  appoint managerial persons but also the power 
to remove them are vested with the RBI under Section 36-AA of the BR  Act, 1949.  Moreover, the  RBI has 
been empowered, to supersede the board of  banking companies.  
Though the business of banking is within the domain of a banking company, the power to control advances 
by banking companies is also provided to RBI under Section 21 of the BR Act, 1949. Similarly, Section 22 of 
the BR Act, 1949 confers on RBI the power to issue license and also to cancel licenses of banking 
companies. Another important regulatory power that has been vested with the RBI is to issue directions to 
banking companies. Under Section 35-A of BR Act, 1949, RBI has the power to issue directions to banking 
companies in the public interest or in the interest of banking policy or to prevent the affairs of any banking 
company being conducted in a manner detrimental to the interests of the depositors or in a manner 
prejudicial to the interests of banking company or to secure the proper management of any banking 
company.  
In this regard, it may be worthwhile to note the observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the 
case of Joseph Kuruvilla v.  Reserve Bank of India {AIR 1962 SC 1373} that in view of history of 
establishment of the Reserve Bank, as a Central Bank for India, its position as a banker's bank, its control 
over the banking companies and banking in India, its position as an issuing bank, its power to license the 
banking companies and cancel their licence and the numerous other powers, it is unanswerable that 
between the Court and the Reserve Bank, the momentous decision to wind up a tottering or unsafe banking 
company in  the interest of the depositors, may reasonably be left to the Reserve  Bank. 
The provisions of the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2017, provides for dealing with cases relating to 
stressed assets. Stressed assets are loans where the borrower has defaulted in repayment or where the 
loan has been restructured, etc.  In terms of Sections 35-AA and 35-AB of the BR Act, 1949, the RBI has 
been specifically authorized to issue directions to banking companies for resolution of stressed assets.  As  a 
part of the supervisory power, the RBI has  been empowered to inspect banking companies on its own or at 
the instance of Central Government under the provisions of the  BR Act, 1949 .In so far as the regulatory and 
supervisory powers of  the RBI over the  public sector banks including the State Bank of India and the 
Regional Rural Banks are concerned, in addition to the provisions available in  the respective Special Acts, 
the provisions as stated in Section 51 of the BR Act shall also be  applicable. Thus an overall responsibility to 
find out the well-being of a banking company, in improving monetary stability and economic growth as well 
as keeping in view the interests of depositors, has been  left  with the Reserve Bank of India. 
Regulation and Supervision of NBFCs 
The regulation and supervision of non-banking financial companies is one of the critical functions that the 
RBI has been entrusted with. Section 45-IA of RBI Act mandates every non-banking  financial  company  to  
obtain  a  certificate  of  registration  from  the  RBI and to maintain net owned fund  as may be specified by 
the RBI in  the Official Gazette, before commencing such non-banking financial  business .  Further, as part 
of regulation and supervision of non-banking financial companies, the RBI has been conferred with  the  
statutory  powers  to  regulate  or  prohibit  issue  of  prospectus  or advertisements  soliciting  deposits  of  
money by non-banking financial companies, power to  determine policy  and  issue directions to  non-
banking financial  companies,  etc.  Further, the RBI has been empowered under Section 45-L of the RBI Act 
to call for information and issue directions to non-banking financial companies for the reasons stated therein. 
As a part of the supervisory control over the non-banking financial companies, the RBI has powers to inspect 
them under Section 45-N of RBI Act, 1934. The RBI shall  exercise  all these  powers  in  the  public interest 
EP-EBCL 
10 
or to  regulate the financial system of the country to its  advantage or to prevent the affairs of any non-
banking financial company being conducted in a manner detrimental to the interest of the depositors or in a 
manner prejudicial to he interest of the non-banking financial company. This makes it clear that the power of 
RBI to regulate and supervise banking companies emanates from the provisions of BR Act whereas the 
powers to regulate and supervise non-banking financial companies has the source from RBI Act. 
Regulation & Supervision of Co-operative banks  
Regulation and supervision of urban co-operative banks is another area the RBI has been entrusted with. In 
terms of Article 246 of the Constitution of India, the exercise of legislative powers of the Union and the State 
are given in the Union List and the State List, i.e. List I and II respectively of the VII Schedule to the 
Constitution. The entry relating to Cooperative Societies fall in State List whereas the entry relating to 
banking falls in the Union List.  These results in the duality of jurisdiction over cooperative banks both by the 
Reserve Ban of India, in terms of Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and the Registrar of Cooperative Societies, 
in terms of the respective State Cooperative Societies Act, of the State concerned. Section 56 of the BR Act, 
1949, makes it applicable to co-operative societies involved in the business of banking. As a part of the 
regulatory and supervisory regime over co-operative banks, the RBI has been entrusted with the powers to 
issue licenses and cancel licenses of co-operative banks, supersede their boards, inspect them and also 
issue directions to them in the public interest, interest of banking policy, control over loans  and advances, 
etc. 
In Janata Sahakari Bank Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra (AIR 1993 Bombay 252) Hon'ble Bombay High Court 
has held that though the control over management of Co-operative Society where  it  is  Cooperative Banking 
Society or otherwise is vested in the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, but insofar as banking is  
concerned, by virtue of S.56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, read with S.35A of the Banking Regulation 
Act, 1949, it  will be a subject with which the Reserve Bank  of India  has full power. 
Regulation of Derivatives and Money Market Instruments 
Chapter III-D was inserted in the RBI Act with effect from 9th January 2007 by way of an amendment to the 
RBI Act, 1934. In the said chapter, the Parliament of India thought it appropriate to introduce provisions 
relating to regulation of transactions relating to derivatives, money market instruments, securities, etc. by the 
RBI. Sub-section (a)  of Section 45U of RBI Act defines derivative as an instrument to be settled at a future 
date, whose value is derived from change in interest  rate, foreign exchange rate, credit rating or  credit 
index, price of securities (also called 'underlying'), or a combination of more than one of them and includes 
interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements, foreign currency swaps, foreign currency-rupee swaps, foreign 
currency options, foreign currency rupee  options or such other instruments as may be specified by the RBI 
from time to time. Similarly, money market instruments have been defined to include call or notice money, 
term money, repo, reverse repo, certificate of deposit, commercial paper and such other debt instrument of 
original or initial maturity up to one year as the RBI may specify from time to time. The powers of RBI to 
regulate money market instruments have been provided under Section 45W of the RBI Act, which  states 
that the RBI may specify from time to time, in public interest or  to regulate the financial system of the country 
to its advantage, determine the policy relating to interest rates or interest rate products and give directions in 
that behalf to all agencies or any of them, dealing in securities, money market instruments, foreign exchange, 
derivatives, or other instruments of like nature. 
Payment and Settlement Functions 
The Parliament of India enacted the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 ('PSS  Act,  2007') with an 
objective to  provide for the regulation and supervision of payment systems in India and to designate 
                                                                         Lesson 1          Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934                                   
11 
Reserve Bank of India as the authority for that purpose and for matters connected therewith or incidental 
thereto.  Under Section 4 of the PSS Act, 2007, no person shall commence or operate a payment system 
except with an authorization issued by the RBI. 
Similarly, under Section 8 of the PSS Act, 2007, RBI has the powers to revoke the authorization granted to 
any person if it contravenes any of the provisions of PSS Act or does not comply with the regulations or fails 
to comply with the orders or directions issued by the RBI or operates the payment system contrary to the 
conditions subject to which the authorization was issued. The regulation and supervision of payment systems 
has been conferred on the RBI by virtue of provisions of Chapter IV f PSS Act, 2007.  The regulatory and 
supervisory controls include the power to  determine standards for the functioning of payment systems, 
power to call for returns, documents or other information, power to enter and inspect payment systems, 
power  to  carry  out  audit  and  inspections , power  to  issue  directions, etc. 
Consumer Protection Functions 
In India, although the provisions of the BR Act, 1949, requires the RBI to bear in mind the vital issue of 
protection of depositors' interests while granting a banking license or cancellation thereof, giving directions 
on advances o  on any banking matter, applying for suspension, winding up, or amalgamation of banks, 
approving appointment of CEOs or additional directors, removal of CEOs, etc., there is no specific provision 
under the BR Act, 1949, or any of the other statutes for forming a formal mechanism for redressal of 
grievances of depositors. In the absence of a specific provision for the purpose, RBI has resorted to its 
powers under Section 35-A of the BR  Act, 1949, to formulate the Banking Ombudsman Scheme for the 
redressal of grievances of depositors. 
Financial Inclusion and Development Functions 
The mushrooming of unauthorized and unregulated money lenders in the financial system of the country 
necessitated the RBI to do something more than what has been provided in the Rule books. Financial 
literacy or financial inclusion, though, not explicitly expressed in the RBI Act, 1934, or the BR Act, 1949, sub-
section (16) of Section 17 of the RBI Act, 1934, enables RBI to do all such matters and things as may be 
incidental to or consequential to the exercise of its powers or the discharge of its duties under the Act. 
Further, India being a country with significant illiteracy, there remains an obligation on the part of the 'State' 
to educate the people and also to include them into the organised financial system of the country to get the 
benefits of professional banking system of the country.  The  amendment to the BR Act, 1949, inserting 
Section  26-A is a step towards achieving this objective, which makes it amply clear that the statute casts  a 
responsibility on the RBI to focus towards  achieving financial  literacy in the country. Not only the  BR Act, 
1949, even the  RBI Act, 1934 , mandates the RBI to maintain expert staff to study various  aspects  of rural 
credit  and  development,  which emphasizes  the  premier  role  to  be  played  by RBI in  promoting financial 
literacy and financial inclusion among the citizens living  even  in the remote areas of the country. 
Right to Issue Bank Notes 
Management of currency is one of the core central banking functions of the Reserve Bank for which it derives 
the necessary statutory powers from Section 22 of the RBI Act, 1934. Along with the Government of India, the 
Reserve Bank is responsible for the design, production and overall management of the nation’s currency, with 
the goal of ensuring an adequate supply of clean and genuine notes. In consultation with the Government, the 
Reserve Bank routinely addresses security issues and targets ways to enhance security features to reduce the 
risk of counterfeiting or forgery of currency notes. 
EP-EBCL 
12 
The Paper Currency Act of 1861 conferred upon the Government of India the monopoly of issuing note, 
thus ending the practice of private and presidency banks issuing currency. Between 1861 and 1935, the 
Government of India managed the issue of paper currency. In 1935, when the Reserve Bank began 
operations, it took over the function of note issue from the Office of the Controller of Currency, 
Government of India. 
Denominations of Notes 
The Indian Currency is called the Indian Rupee (abbreviated as Re. in singular and Rs. in plural), and its 
sub-denomination the Paisa (plural Paise). At present, notes in India are issued in the denomination of `5, 
`10, `20, `50, `100, `200, `500 and `2,000. The printing of `1 and `2 denominations has been 
discontinued. However, notes in these denominations issued earlier are still valid and in circulation. The 
Reserve Bank is also authorised to issue notes in the denominations of five thousand rupees and ten 
thousand rupees or any other denomination, but not exceeding ten thousand rupees that the Central 
Government may specify. Thus, in terms of Section 24 of RBI Act 1934, notes in denominations higher than 
ten thousand rupees cannot be issued. The Central Government may, on the recommendation of the Central 
Board, direct the non-issue or the discontinuance of issue of bank notes of such denominational values as it 
may specify in this behalf. The Government of India announced the demonetisation of `500 and `1000 bank 
notes with effect from midnight of November 8, 2016, making these notes invalid.  A newly redesigned series 
of `500 banknote, in addition to a new denomination of`2000 banknote is in circulation since 10 November 
2016. 
Form of Bank Notes 
The Department of Currency Management makes recommendations on design of bank notes to the Central 
Government, forecasts the demand for notes, and ensures smooth distribution of notes and coins throughout 
the country [Section 25]. It arranges to withdraw unfit notes, administers the provisions of the RBI (Note 
Refund) Rules, 2009 (these rules deal with the payment of value of the soiled or mutilated notes) and 
reviews/rationalises the work systems and procedures at the issue offices on an ongoing basis. 
Legal tender character of notes 
Section 24 sub-section (1) of the Act states that subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), every bank note 
shall be legal tender at any place in India in payment or on account for the amount expressed therein, and 
shall be guaranteed by the Central Government. 
Sub-section 2 empowers the Central Government, on recommendation of the Central Board, by notification 
in the Gazette of India to declare that, with effect from such date as may be specified in the notification, any 
series of bank notes of any denomination to cease to be legal tender save at such office or agency of the 
Bank and to such extent as may be specified in the notification. 
Currency Distribution 
The Government of India on the advice of the Reserve Bank decides on the various denominations of the 
notes to be printed. The Reserve Bank coordinates with the Government in designing the banknotes, 
including their security features.  
The printed notes received from Printing Press set up by Government and RBI are issued for circulation both 
through remittances to banks as also the Reserve Bank counters. 
                                                                         Lesson 1          Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934                                   
13 
Coin Distribution 
The Indian Coinage Act, 1906 governs the minting of rupee coins, including small coins of the value of less 
than one rupee. Coins are legal tender in India for unlimited amounts. Fifty paisa coins are legal tender for 
any sum not exceeding ten rupees and smaller coins for any sum not exceeding one rupee. The Reserve 
Bank acts as an agent of the Central Government for distribution, issue and handling of the coins and for 
withdrawing and remitting them back to Government as may be necessary. 
Combating Counterfeiting 
The Reserve Bank, in consultation with the Government of India, periodically reviews and upgrades the 
security features of the bank notes to deter counterfeiting. It also shares information with various law 
enforcement agencies to address the issue of counterfeiting. It has also issued detailed guidelines to banks 
and government treasury offices on how to detect and impound counterfeit notes. 
Bank exempt from stamp duty on bank notes 
The Bank is not liable to the payment of any stamp duty under the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, in respect of 
bank notes issued by it {section 29]. 
Powers of Central Government to supersede Central Board 
Section 30 Sub section (1) of the states that if in the opinion of Central Government the Bank fails to carry 
out any of the obligations imposed on it by or under the Act, by notification in the Gazette of India, declare 
the Central Board to be superseded, and thereafter the general superintendence and direction of the affairs 
of the Bank shall be entrusted to such agency at the Central Government may determine, and such agency 
may exercise the powers and do all acts and things which may be exercised or done by the Central Board 
under the Act. 
As per sub section 2 of this section when action is taken under this section the Central Government shall 
cause a full report of the circumstances leading to such action and of the action taken to be laid before 
Parliament at the earliest possible opportunity and in any case within three months from the issue of the 
notification superseding the Board. 
Issue of demand bills and notes 
Section 31 Sub section (1) of the states that no person in India other than the Bank, or, as expressly 
authorized by the Act the Central Government shall draw, accept, make or issue any bill of exchange, hundi, 
promissory note or engagement for the payment of money payable to bearer on demand, or borrow, owe or 
take up any sum or sums of money on the bills, hundis or notes payable to bearer on demand of any such 
person: However cheques or drafts, including hundis, payable to bearer on demand or otherwise may be 
drawn on a person's account with a banker, shroff or agent. 
As per sub section 2 of this section notwithstanding anything contained in the Negotiable Instrument Act, 
1881, no person in India other than the Bank or, as expressly authorized by the Act, the Central Government 
shall make or issue any promissory note expressed to be payable to the bearer of the instrument. 
Banker to the Central Government & State Governments 
Reserve Bank acts as banker to all the State Governments in India, except Jammu & Kashmir and Sikkim. It 
has limited agreements for the management of the public debt of these two State Governments. As a banker 
EP-EBCL 
14 
to the Government, the Reserve Bank receives and pays money on behalf of the various Government 
departments.  
The Reserve Bank also undertakes to float loans and manage them on behalf of the Governments. It also 
provides Ways and Means Advances – a short-term interest bearing advance – to the Governments, to meet 
the temporary mismatches in their receipts and payments. Besides, it arranges for investments of surplus 
cash balances of the Governments as a portfolio manager. The Reserve Bank also acts as adviser to 
Government, whenever called upon to do so, on monetary and banking related matters.  
The banking functions for the governments are carried out by the Public Accounts Departments at the offices 
/branches of the Reserve Bank, while management of public debt including floatation of new loans is done at 
Public Debt Office at offices/branches of the Reserve Bank and by the Internal Debt Management 
Department at the Central Office.  
Management of Public Debt 
The Reserve Bank manages the public debt and issues new loans on behalf of the Central and State 
Governments. It involves issue and retirement of rupee loans, interest payment on the loan and operational 
matters about debt certificates and their registration.  
The union budget decides the annual borrowing needs of the Central Government. Parameters, such as, 
interest rate, timing and manner of raising of loans are influenced by the state of liquidity and the 
expectations of the market. The Reserve Bank’s debt management policy aims at minimising the cost of 
borrowing, reducing the roll-over risk, smoothening the maturity structure of debt, and improving depth and 
liquidity of Government securities markets by developing an active secondary market.  
Reserve Bank as Banker to Banks 
The Reserve Bank to fulfill this function, opens current accounts of banks with itself, enabling these banks to 
maintain cash reserves as well as to carry out inter-bank transactions through these accounts. Inter-bank 
accounts can also be settled by transfer of money through electronic fund transfer system, such as, the Real 
Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS).  
In addition, the Reserve Bank has also introduced the Centralised Funds Management System (CFMS) to 
facilitate centralised funds enquiry and transfer of funds across Deposit Accounts Department (DADs). This 
helps banks in their fund management as they can access information on their balances maintained across 
different DADs from a single location.  
As Banker to Banks, the Reserve Bank provides short-term loans and advances to select banks, when 
necessary, to facilitate lending to specific sectors and for specific purposes. These loans are provided 
against promissory notes and other collateral given by the banks. 
The Reserve Bank also acts as the ‘lender of last resort’. It can come to the rescue of a bank that is solvent 
but faces temporary liquidity problems by supplying it with much needed liquidity when no one else is willing 
to extend credit to that bank. The Reserve Bank extends this facility to protect the interest of the depositors 
of the bank and to prevent possible failure of a bank, which in turn may also affect other banks and 
institutions and can have an adverse impact on financial stability and thus on the economy. 
Financial Regulation and Supervision 
The Reserve Bank’s regulatory and supervisory domain extends not only to the Indian banking system but 
                                                                         Lesson 1          Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934                                   
15 
also to the development financial institutions (DFIs), non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), primary 
dealers, credit information companies and select segments of the financial markets.  
As the regulator and the supervisor of the banking system, the Reserve Bank has a critical role to play in 
ensuring the system’s safety and soundness on an ongoing basis. The objective of this function is to protect 
the interest of depositors through an effective prudential regulatory framework for orderly development and 
conduct of banking operations, and to maintain overall financial stability through various policy measures. 
Prudential Norms for Banks 
In order to strengthen the balance sheets of banks, the Reserve Bank has been prescribing appropriate 
prudential norms for them in regard to income recognition, asset classification and provisioning, capital 
adequacy, investments portfolio and capital market exposures, to name a few. A brief description of these 
norms is furnished below: 
Capital Adequacy: The Reserve Bank has instructed banks to maintain adequate capital on a continuous 
basis. The adequacy of capital is measured in terms of Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR). 
Under the recently revised framework, banks are required to maintain adequate capital for credit risk, market 
risk, operational risk and other risks. Basel II standardised approach is applicable with road map drawn up 
for advanced approaches. 
Loans and Advances: In order to maintain the quality of their loans and advances, the Reserve Bank 
requires banks to classify their loan assets as performing and non-performing assets (NPA), primarily based 
on the record of recovery from the borrowers. NPAs are further categorised into Sub-standard, Doubtful and 
Loss Assets depending upon age of the NPAs and value of available securities. Banks are also required to 
make appropriate provisions against each category of NPAs. Banks are also required to have exposure limits 
in place to prevent credit concentration risk and limit exposures to sensitive sectors, such as, capital markets 
and real estate. 
Investments: The Reserve Bank requires banks to classify their investment portfolios into three categories for 
the purpose of valuation: Held to Maturity (HTM), Available for Sale (AFS) and Held for Trading (HFT). The 
securities held under HFT and AFS categories have to be marked-to-market periodically and depreciation, if 
any, needs appropriate provisions by banks. Securities under HTM category must be carried at acquisition / 
amortised cost, subject to certain conditions. 
Foreign Exchange Reserves Management 
The Reserve Bank, as the custodian of the country’s foreign exchange reserves, is vested with the 
responsibility of managing their investment. The legal provisions governing management of foreign exchange 
reserves are laid down in the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. 
The Reserve Bank’s reserves management function has in recent years grown both in terms of importance 
and sophistication for two main reasons. First, the share of foreign currency assets in the balance sheet of 
the Reserve Bank has substantially increased. Second, with the increased volatility in exchange and interest 
rates in the global market, the task of preserving the value of reserves and obtaining a reasonable return on 
them has become challenging. The basic parameters of the Reserve Bank’s policies for foreign exchange 
reserves management are safety, liquidity and returns. 
Within this framework, the Reserve Bank focuses on: 
 
(a) Maintaining market’s confidence in monetary and exchange rate policies. 
EP-EBCL 
16 
 
(b) Enhancing the Reserve Bank’s intervention capacity to stabilise foreign exchange markets. 
 
(c) Limiting external vulnerability by maintaining foreign currency liquidity to absorb shocks during times 
of crisis, including national disasters or emergencies. 
 
(d) Providing confidence to the markets that external obligations can always be met, thus reducing the 
costs at which foreign exchange resources are available to market participants. 
 
(e) Adding to the comfort of market participants by demonstrating the backing of domestic currency by 
external assets. 
While safety and liquidity continue to be the twin-pillars of reserves management, return optimisation has 
become an embedded strategy within this framework. The Reserve Bank has framed policy guidelines 
stipulating stringent eligibility criteria for issuers, counterparties, and investments to be made with them to 
enhance the safety and liquidity of reserves. The Reserve Bank, in consultation with the Government, 
continuously reviews the reserves management strategies. 
Transactions in foreign exchange 
Section 40 of the Act says that the Bank shall sell to or buy from any authorized person who makes a 
demand in that behalf at its office in Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi or Madras or at such of its branches as the 
Central Government may, by order, determine, foreign exchange at such rates of exchange and on such 
conditions as the Central Government may from time to time by general or special order determine, having 
regard so far as rates of exchange are concerned to its obligations to the International Monetary Fund: 
In this section "authorized person" means a person who is entitled by or under the Foreign Exchange 
Regulation Act,to buy, or as the case may be, sell, the foreign exchange to which his demand relates. 
Market Operations 
The Reserve Bank operationalises its monetary policy through its operations in government securities, 
foreign exchange and money markets. 
Open Market Operations: Open Market Operations in the form of outright purchase/sale of Government 
securities are an important tool of the Reserve Bank’s monetary management. The Bank carries out such 
operations in the secondary market on the electronic Negotiated Dealing System – Order Matching (NDS-
OM) platform by placing bids and/or taking the offers for securities.  
Liquidity Adjustment Facility Auctions: The liquidity management operations are aimed at modulating liquidity 
conditions such that the overnight rates in the money market remains within the informal corridor set by the 
repo and reverse repo rates for the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) operations. In a repo transaction, the 
Reserve Bank infuses liquidity into the system by taking securities as collateral, while in a reverse repo 
transaction it absorbs liquidity from the system with the Reserve Bank providing securities to the counter 
parties.  
Market Stabilisation Scheme: The Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) was introduced in April 2004 under 
which Government of India dated securities/treasury bills could be issued to absorb surplus structural/ 
durable liquidity created by the Reserve Bank’s foreign exchange operations. MSS operations are a 
sterilisation tool used for offsetting the liquidity impact created by intervention in the foreign exchange 
markets.  
                                                                         Lesson 1          Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934

Payment and Settlement Systems 
The regulation and supervision of payment systems is being increasingly recognised as a core responsibility 
of central banks. Safe and efficient functioning of these systems is an important pre-requisite for proper 
functioning of financial system and the efficient transmission of monetary policy. 
The Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 provides for regulation and supervision of payment systems 
in India and designates the Reserve Bank as the authority for the purpose. As per the Act, only payment 
systems authorised by the Reserve Bank can be operated in the country. The Act also provides for the 
settlement effected under the rules and procedures of the system provider to be treated as final and 
irrevocable 
The Reserve Bank has put in place an institutional framework and structure for oversight of the payment 
systems. In 2005, it created a Board for Regulation and Supervision of Payment and Settlement Systems 
(BPSS) as a Committee of the Central Board. A new department called the Department of Payment and 
Settlement Systems (DPSS) was constituted to assist the BPSS in performing its functions. 
The Reserve Bank has adopted a three-pronged strategy of consolidation, development and integration to 
establish a modern and robust payment and settlement system which is also efficient and secure. The 
consolidation revolves around expanding the reach of the existing products by introducing clearing process 
in new locations.  
The Reserve Bank has also taken steps towards integrating the payment system with the settlement systems 
for government securities and foreign exchange. To facilitate settlement of Government securities 
transactions, it created the Negotiated Dealing System, a screen-based trading platform. 
For settlement of trade in foreign exchange, Government securities and other debt instrument, it has set up 
the Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL). This plays the role of a central counter party to transactions 
and guarantees settlement of trade, thus managing the counter party risk. 
Monetary Policy Management 
One of the most important functions of central banks is formulation and execution of monetary policy. In the 
Indian context, the basic functions of the Reserve Bank of India as enunciated in the Preamble to the RBI 
Act, 1934 are: “to regulate the issue of Bank notes and the keeping of reserves with a view to securing 
monetary stability in India and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its 
advantage.” Thus, the Reserve Bank’s mandate for monetary policy flows from its monetary stability 
objective. Essentially, monetary policy deals with the use of various policy instruments for influencing the 
cost and availability of money in the economy. As macroeconomic conditions change, a central bank may 
change the choice of instruments in its monetary policy. The overall goal is to promote economic growth and 
ensure price stability. 
Monetary Policy 
Monetary policy refers to the policy of the central bank with regard to the use of monetary instruments under 
its control to achieve the goals specified in the Act. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is vested with the 
responsibility of adopting and implementing monetary policy. This responsibility is explicitly mandated under 
the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. The primary objective of monetary policy is to maintain price stability 
while keeping in mind the objective of growth. Price stability is a necessary precondition to sustainable 
growth. 
EP-EBCL

Monetary Policy Framework 
The RBI Act explicitly provides empowers the Reserve Bank to operate the monetary policy framework of the 
country. 
• The framework aims at setting the policy (repo) rate based on an assessment of the current and 
evolving macroeconomic situation; and modulation of liquidity conditions to anchor money market 
rates at or around the repo rate. Repo rate changes transmit through the money market to the entire 
the financial system, which, in turn, influences aggregate demand – a key determinant of inflation and 
growth. 
• Once the repo rate is announced, the operating framework designed by the Reserve Bank envisages 
liquidity management on a day-to-day basis through appropriate actions, which aim at anchoring the 
operating target– the Weighted Average Call Rate (WACR) – around the repo rate. 
• The operating framework is fine-tuned and revised depending on the evolving financial market and 
monetary conditions, while ensuring consistency with the monetary policy stance.  
Instruments of Monetary Policy 
There are several direct and indirect instruments that are used for implementing monetary policy. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Repo Rate: The (fixed) interest rate at which the Reserve Bank provides overnight liquidity to banks 
against the collateral of government and other approved securities under the Liquidity Adjustment 
Facility (LAF). 
• Reverse Repo Rate: The (fixed) interest rate at which the Reserve Bank absorbs liquidity, on an 
overnight basis, from banks against the collateral of eligible government securities under the LAF. 
• Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF): The LAF consists of overnight as well as term repo auctions. 
Progressively, the Reserve Bank has increased the proportion of liquidity injected under fine-tuning 
variable rate repo auctions of range of tenors. The aim of term repo is to help develop the inter-bank 
term money market, which in turn can set market based benchmarks for pricing of loans and 
deposits, and hence improve transmission of monetary policy. The Reserve Bank also conducts 
variable interest rate reverse repo auctions, as necessitated under the market conditions. 
                                                                         Lesson 1          Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934                                   
19 
• Marginal Standing Facility (MSF): A facility under which scheduled commercial banks can borrow 
additional amount of overnight money from the Reserve Bank by dipping into their Statutory Liquidity 
Ratio (SLR) portfolio up to a limit at a penal rate of interest. This provides a safety valve against 
unanticipated liquidity shocks to the banking system. 
• Corridor: The MSF rate and reverse repo rate determine the corridor for the daily movement in the 
weighted average call money rate. 
• Bank Rate: It is the rate at which the Reserve Bank is ready to buy or rediscount bills of exchange or 
other commercial papers. The Bank Rate is published under Section 49 of the Reserve Bank of India 
Act, 1934. This rate has been aligned to the MSF rate and, therefore, changes automatically as and 
when the MSF rate changes alongside policy repo rate changes. 
• Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR): The average daily balance that a bank is required to maintain with the 
Reserve Bank as a share of such per cent of its Net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) that the 
Reserve Bank may notify from time to time in the Gazette of India. 
• Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR): The share of NDTL that a bank is required to maintain in safe and 
liquid assets, such as, unencumbered government securities, cash and gold. Changes in SLR often 
influence the availability of resources in the banking system for lending to the private sector. 
• Open Market Operations (OMOs): These include both, outright purchase and sale of government 
securities, for injection and absorption of durable liquidity, respectively. 
• Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS): This instrument for monetary management was introduced in 
2004. Surplus liquidity of a more enduring nature arising from large capital inflows is absorbed 
through sale of short-dated government securities and treasury bills. The cash so mobilised is held in 
a separate government account with the Reserve Bank. 
Constitution of Monetary Policy Committee 
Section 45ZB of the Act states that:- 
 
(1) The Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, constitute a Committee to be 
called the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank.  
 
(2) The Monetary Policy Committee shall consist of the following Members, namely:—

(c) one officer of the Bank to be nominated by the Central Board—Member, ex officio; and  
 
(d) three persons to be appointed by the Central Government—Members.  
 
(3) The Monetary Policy Committee shall determine the Policy Rate required to achieve the inflation 
target.  
 
(4) The decision of the Monetary Policy Committee shall be binding on the Bank. 
Meetings of Monetary Policy Committee  
Section 45ZI of the Act states that:- 
 
(1) The Bank shall organise at least four meetings of the Monetary Policy Committee in a year.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
As  per  Article  246  of  Constitution  of  India,  the 
Parliament  has  exclusive  power  to  make  laws  
with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the 
Union List in the Seventh Schedule. The Foreign 
Exchange Management  Act,  1999  can  be  traced  
to  various entries  in  the  Union  List.  Entry 16 of 
the Union List deals with Foreign jurisdiction. Entry 
36 of the Union List deals with Currency, coinage 
and legal tender; foreign exchange.   Entry  37  of

commerce  with  foreign countries; import and export 
across customs frontiers; definition of customs 
frontiers. 
The legal framework for administration of foreign 
exchange transactions in India is provided by the 
Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999. Under 
the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 
(FEMA), which came into force with effect from June 
1, 2000, all transactions involving foreign exchange 
have been classified either as capital account 
transactions or current account transactions. 
The object of the study is to familiarize the students 
with the overview of regulatory structure under 
Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999. 
 
 
 
  
“Foreign  Exchange  Management  Act,  1999  is  an  Act  to  facilitate  external  trade  and  payments  and  for  
promoting  the orderly development and maintenance of foreign exchange market in India.” 
Preamble  
LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 
A system of exchange control was first time introduced through a series of rules under the Defence of India 
Act, 1939 on temporary basis. As the foreign exchange crisis persisted for a long time Foreign Exchange 
Regulation Act, 1947 was enacted initially for a period of ten years.  However, 10 years of economic 
development did not ease the foreign exchange constraint, FERA permanently entered the statue book in 
1957. 
Subsequently, this Act was replaced by the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 (FERA, 1973), which 
came into force with effect from January 1, 1974. In 1974, FERA was completely overhauled with all offences 
being considered as criminal offences with mens rea. The Enforcement Directorate was empowered to arrest 
any person without even arrest warrant. 
In the 1990s, consistent with the general philosophy of economic reforms a sea change relating to the broad 
approach to reform in the external sector took place. In 1991 government of India initiated the policy of 
economic liberalization. Foreign investments in many sectors were permitted. This resulted in increased flow 
of foreign exchange in India and foreign exchange reserves increased substantially. 
In 1997, the Tarapore Committee on Capital Account Convertibility (CAC), constituted by the Reserve Bank, 
had indicated the preconditions for Capital Account Convertibility. The three crucial preconditions were fiscal 
consolidation, a mandated inflation target and, strengthening of the financial system. The Tarapore 
Committee had also recommended change in the legislative framework governing foreign exchange 
transactions. 
A Bill introduced in the Lok Sabha on 4 August, 1998 was referred to the Standing Committee on Finance 
which submitted it’s report to the House on 23 December ’98 with suggestion and modifications. As the 12th 
Lok Sabha was dissolved before any decision could be taken on the Bill, the Bill lapsed consequently. The 
Bill was again introduced in the 13th Lok Sabha on 25th October 1999 and was passed in the winter session 
of Parliament in 1999. The President Assent was received on 29th December, 1999.  
Finally FEMA came into force w.e.f. 1st June 2000.  Accordingly, the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act 
(FERA) was repealed and replaced by the new Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) with effect from 
June 2000. The philosophical approach was shifted from that of conservation of foreign exchange to one of 
facilitating trade and payments as well as developing orderly foreign exchange market. 
Overview of FEMA 
The Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 was enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to 
foreign exchange with the objective of facilitating external trade and payments and for promoting the orderly 
development and maintenance of foreign exchange market in India. In fact it is the central legislation that 
deals with inbound investments into India and outbound investments from India and trade and business 
between India and the other countries.

Applicability 
Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 extends to the whole of India. The Act also applies to all 
branches, offices and agencies outside India owned or controlled by a person resident in India and also to 
any contravention thereunder committed outside India by any person to whom this Act applies. 
FEMA has considerably liberalised provisions in respect of foreign exchange. However, in extraordinary 
situations may arise. The Central Government has been empowered to suspend operation of any or all 
provisions of FEMA in public interest, by issuing a notification. The Central Government has also been 
empowered to relax suspension by issuing a notification. 
Overall Scheme of FEMA 
FEMA makes provisions for dealings in foreign exchange. Broadly, all Current Account Transactions are 
free. However, Central Government can impose reasonable restrictions by issuing rules (Section 3 
FEMA).Capital Account Transactions are permitted to the extent specified by RBI by issuing Regulations. 
(Section 6 of FEMA) 
FEMA envisages that RBI shall have a controlling role in management of foreign exchange. Since RBI 
cannot directly handle foreign exchange transactions, it authorizes “Authorised Persons” to deal in foreign 
exchange.  RBI has been empowered to issue directions to such “Authorised Persons” under Section 11.  
FEMA also makes provisions for enforcement, penalties, adjudication and appeal. The FEMA 1999 contains

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
When a business enterprise imports goods from 
other countries,  exports  its  products  to  them  or  
makes investments  abroad,  it  deals  in  foreign  
exchange.  
Foreign  exchange  means  'foreign  currency'  and 
includes  deposits,  credits  and  balances  payable  
in any  foreign  currency;  drafts,  travellers'  
cheques, letters  of  credit  or  bills  of  exchange,  
expressed  or drawn  in  Indian  currency  but  
payable  in  any  foreigncurrency;  and  drafts,  
travellers'  cheques,  letters  of credit or bills of 
exchange drawn by banks, institutions or  persons  
outside  India,  but  payable  in  Indian currency. 
The  management  of  foreign  exchange  is  very 
important  in  the  present  day  business.  This 
lesson deals with how FEMA facilitates external 
trade and payments and promotes the orderly 
development and maintenance of foreign exchange 
market. The Act has assigned an important role to 
the 
Reserve 
Bank 
of 
India 
(RBI) 
in 
the 
administration of FEMA. The rules, regulations and 
norms pertaining to several sections of the Act are 
laid down by the Reserve Bank of India, in 
consultation with the Central Government. 
The object of the study is to familiarize the students 
with the Foreign Exchange Transactions and 
compliances thereto. 
 
  
The  Foreign  Exchange Management  Act, 1999 was enacted by the Parliament, taking  into  consideration  the  
developments  such  as  substantial  increase  in  foreign  exchanges  reserves, growth  in  foreign  trade,  
rationalization  of  tariffs,  current  account  convertibility  etc.,

INTRODUCTION 
The Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973, which was enacted to consolidate and amend the law in 
several respects encompassing the experience gained over few decades of implementation of the earlier 
enactment of 1947, had outlived its purpose in the light of the liberalization policies introduced in 1991. 
The Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, since then had been reviewed and amendments were made as part 
of ongoing process of economic liberalization relating to foreign investment and foreign trade for closer 
interaction with the world economy. During the subsequent period, the Central Government decided further 
review of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act in the light of developments and experience in relation to 
foreign trade and investment. It was at that time felt, that a better course would be to repeal the Foreign 
Exchange Regulation Act and enact a new legislation. 
Accordingly, taking into consideration the developments such as substantial increase in foreign exchanges 
reserves, growth in foreign trade, rationalization of tariffs, current account convertibility etc., the Foreign 
Exchange Management Bill, to repeal and replace the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act was introduced in 
the Lok Sabha. But before the Bill came up for discussion and approval, the Lok Sabha was dissolved. 
Subsequently, certain modifications were made to the original Bill and a modified Bill was presented and 
passed by both the Houses of Parliament. The Foreign Exchange Management Act received the assent of 
the President on 9th December, 1999 and brought into force with effect from 1st June, 2000. Foreign 
Exchange Management Act, 1999 is an Act to facilitate external trade and payments and for promoting the 
orderly development and maintenance of foreign exchange market in India. 
IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS 
Section 2 of the Foreign Exchange Management Act defines various terms used in the Act, and certain 
important definitions are given below: 
Adjudicating Authority [Section 2(a)] 
According to clause (a) of Section 2 ‘Adjudicating Authority’ means an officer authorised under Sub-section 
(1) of Section 16 for the purposes of adjudication in respect of penalties under Section 13. Section 16 
empowers the Central Government, to appoint, by an order published in the Official Gazette, as many

manager or secretary or other officer of the company, they will also be deemed to be guilty of contravention

COMPOUNDING OF CONTRAVENTIONS  
Contravention is a breach of the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999 and 
rules/regulations/notification/orders/directions/circulars issued there under. Compounding refers to the 
process of voluntarily admitting the contravention, pleading guilty and seeking redressal. The Reserve Bank 
is empowered to compound any contraventions as defined under section 13 of FEMA, 1999 except the 
contravention under section 3(a), for a specified sum after offering an opportunity of personal hearing to the 
contravener. It is a voluntary process in which an individual or a corporate seeks compounding of an 
admitted contravention. It provides comfort to any person who contravenes any provisions of FEMA, 1999 
[except section 3(a) of the Act] by minimizing transaction costs. Willful, malafide and fraudulent transactions 
are, however, viewed seriously, which will not be compounded by the Reserve Bank. 
Any person who contravenes any provision of the FEMA, 1999 [except section 3(a)] or contravenes any rule, 
regulation, notification, direction or order issued in exercise of the powers under this Act or contravenes any 
condition subject to which an authorization is issued by the Reserve Bank, can apply for compounding to the 
Reserve Bank. Applications seeking compounding of contraventions under section 3(a) of FEMA, 1999 may 
be submitted to the Directorate of Enforcement.

Pre-requisite for Compounding Process 
 In respect of a contravention committed by any person within a period of three years from the date on 
which a similar contravention committed by him was compounded under the Compounding Rules, such 
contraventions would not be compounded and relevant provisions of the FEMA, 1999 shall apply. Any 
second or subsequent contravention committed after the expiry of a period of three years from the date 
on which the contravention was previously compounded shall be deemed to be a first contravention. 
 Contraventions relating to any transaction where proper approvals or permission from the Government or 
any statutory authority concerned, as the case may be, have not been obtained such contraventions 
would not be compounded unless the required approvals are obtained from the concerned authorities. 
 Cases of contravention such as those having a money laundering angle, national security concerns 
and/or involving serious infringements of the regulatory framework or where the contravener fails to pay 
the sum for which contravention was compounded within the specified period in terms of the 
compounding order, shall be referred to the Directorate of Enforcement for further investigation and 
EP-EBCL 
54 
necessary action under FEMA, 1999 or to the authority instituted for implementation of the Prevention of 
Money Laundering Act 2002, or to any other agencies, for necessary action as deemed fit. 
 In this connection, it is clarified that whenever a contravention is identified by the Reserve Bank or 
brought to its notice by the entity involved in contravention by way of a reference other than through the 
prescribed application for compounding, the Bank will continue to decide 
• whether a contravention is technical and/or minor in nature and, as such, can be dealt with by way of 
an administrative/ cautionary advice; 
• whether it is material and, hence, is required to be compounded for which the necessary compounding 
procedure has to be followed or 
• whether the issues involved are sensitive / serious in nature and, therefore, need to be referred to the 
Directorate of Enforcement (DOE). However, once a compounding application is filed by the 
concerned entity suo moto, admitting the contravention, the same will not be considered as ‘technical’ 
or ‘minor’ in nature and the compounding process shall be initiated in terms of section 15 (1) of 
Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 read with Rule 9 of Foreign Exchange (Compounding 
Proceedings) Rules, 2000. 
Scope and Procedure for Compounding 
 On receipt of the application for compounding, the Reserve Bank shall examine the application based on 
the documents and submissions made in the application and assess whether contravention is 
quantifiable and, if so, the amount of contravention. 
 The Compounding Authority may call for any information, record or any other documents relevant to the 
compounding proceedings. In case the contravener fails to submit the additional information/documents 
called for within the specified period, the application for compounding will be liable for rejection. 
 The following factors, which are only indicative, may be taken into consideration for the purpose of 
passing compounding order and adjudging the quantum of sum on payment of which contravention shall 
be compounded: 
• the amount of gain of unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the contravention; 
• the amount of loss caused to any authority/ agency/ exchequer as a result of the contravention; 
• economic benefits accruing to the contravener from delayed compliance or compliance avoided; 
• the repetitive nature of the contravention, the track record and/or history of non-compliance of the 
contravener; 
• contravener’s conduct in undertaking the transaction and in disclosure of full facts in the application 
and submissions made during the personal hearing; and any other factor as considered relevant and

 The time limit for this purpose would be reckoned from the date of receipt of the completed application 
for compounding by the Reserve Bank. 
 If the applicant opts for appearing for the personal hearing, the Reserve Bank would encourage the 
applicant to appear directly for it rather than being represented / accompanied by legal experts / 
consultants, as compounding is only for admitted contraventions. Appearing for or opting out of personal 
hearing does not have any bearing whatsoever on the amount imposed in the compounding order. If the 
authorized representative of the applicant is unavailable for the personal hearing, the Compounding 
Authority may pass the order based on available information/ documents. 
 The Compounding Order shall specify the provisions of the FEMA, 1999 or any rule, regulation, 
notification, direction or order issued in exercise of the powers under FEMA, 1999 in respect of which

 One copy of the compounding order issued under sub rule (2) of Rule 8 of Foreign Exchange 
(Compounding Proceedings) Rules, 2000 shall be supplied to the applicant (the contravener) and also to 
the Adjudicating Authority, where the compounding of any contravention is made after making of a 
complaint under sub-section (3) of section 16 of the FEMA, as the case may be. 
 To ensure more transparency and greater disclosure, it has been decided to host the compounding 
orders passed on the Reserve Bank’s website (www.rbi.org.in).

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 is 
internal security legislation and regulated by Ministry 
of Home Affaires which prohibits certain classes of 
persons from receiving ‘foreign contribution’.  It  also  
restricts certain classes  of  persons  from  accepting  
foreign  hospitality while  visiting  any  country  or  
territory  outside  India, without the prior permission 
of the Central Government.  
The Act provides that persons having definite 
cultural, economic,  educational,  religious  and  
social programmes should get themselves registered 
with the Government  of  India  before  accepting  
any  ‘foreign contribution’.  “Foreign  contribution”  
means  the donation,  delivery  or  transfer  made  by  
any  foreign source  of  any  article,  not  being  an  
article  given  to  a person  as  a  gift  for  his  
personal  use,  if  the  market value, in India, of such 
article, on the date of such gift, is not more than such 
sum as may be specified from time  to  time,  by  the  
Central  Government  by  the  rules made  by  it  in  
this  behalf;  of  any  currency,  whether Indian  or  
foreign;  any  security  as  defined  under Securities 
Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and the Foreign 
Exchange Management Act, 1999.  
The  Act  mandates  that  every  bank  or  authorized 
person  in  foreign  exchange  shall  report  to  
specified authority, the prescribed amount of foreign 
remittance, source  and  manner  in  which  foreign  
remittance  was received  and  other  particulars  in  
such  form  and manner  as  may  be  prescribed.   
The  object  of  the study  is  to  familiarize  the  
students  with  the  legal requirements stipulated 
under the FCRA, 2010. 
  
The  object  of  the  Foreign  Contribution  (Regulation) Act,  2010  is  to  regulate  the  acceptance  and  utilisation  of  
foreign contribution or  foreign  hospitality  by  certain  individuals  or  associations  or  companies  and  to  prohibit  
acceptance  and utilisation of foreign contribution or foreign hospitality for any activities detrimental to the national 
interest and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL 
58 
INTRODUCTION 
The Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 1976 was enacted to regulate the acceptance and utilization of 
foreign contribution or hospitality with a view to ensuring that the  Parliamentary institutions, political 
associations, academic and other voluntary organizations as well as individuals working in important areas of 
national life may function in a manner consistent with the values of sovereign democratic republic. The Act 
was amended in 1984 to extend it provisions to cover second and subsequent recipients of foreign 
contribution and to the members of higher judiciary, besides introducing the system of grant of registration to 
the association receiving foreign contribution. 
Significant development have taken place since 1984 such as change in internal security scenario, an 
increased influence of voluntary organizations, spread of use of communication and information technology, 
quantum jump in the amount of foreign contribution being received, and large scale growth in the number of 
registered organizations. This has necessitated large scale changes in the Act of 1976 and therefore, it was 
thought appropriate to replace the FCRA, 1976 by a new legislation to regulate the acceptance and 
utilization of foreign contribution and foreign hospitality by a person or association. 
The Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 has come into effect from May 1, 2011. The Ministry of 
Home Affairs has issued the necessary Gazette Notification vide S.O. 999 (E) dated the 29th April, 2011 in 
this regard. The Ministry of Home Affairs has also issued a Gazette Notification vide G.S.R. 349 (E) dated 
the 29th April, 2011 notifying the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Rules, 2011 made under section 48 of 
FCRA, 2010. The FCR Rules, 2011 have come into force simultaneously with FCRA, 2010.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) provides a situation 
where in both the host and the home nations derive 
some benefit. The home countries want to take the 
advantage of the vast markets opened by industrial 
growth. Whereas the host countries get to acquire 
resources 
ranging 
from 
financial, 
capital, 
entrepreneurship, 
technological 
know-how 
and 
managerial skills which assist it in supplementing its 
domestic savings and foreign exchange. 
India’s Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is an 
endorsement of its status as a preferred investment 
destination amongst global investors. India’s steady 
economic liberalization and its embrace of the 
global economy have been key factors in attracting 
FDI. To promote Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), 
the Government has put in place an investor-
friendly policy, wherein  except for a small negative 
list, most sectors are open for 100% FDI under the 
Automatic route. 
The  object  of  the study  is  to  familiarize  the  
students  with  the  legal requirements stipulated 
under the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Policy. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
The Government has put in place a policy framework on Foreign Direct Investment, which is transparent, predictable 
and easily comprehensible.  This framework is embodied in the Circular on Consolidated FDI Policy.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Joint Ventures/Wholly Owned Subsidiaries abroad 
promote economic co-operation between India and 
the host countries.  They  result  in  transfer  of  
technology  and skills, sharing the results of 
Research & Development, access to global market, 
promotion of brand image,  generation  of  
employment  and  utilization of raw materials  
available  in  India  and  the  host  country,  
increased  exports  of  plant  and machinery and 
goods and services from India, foreign exchange 
earnings through dividend, royalty, technical know-
how fee, etc. Since globalization of trade is a two-
way process, integration  of Indian  economy  with   
rest  of  the  world  with  all  its  attendant  benefits  
is  achieved through  overseas  investment. 
The  object  of  the study  is  to  familiarize  the  
students  with  the  regulatory and procedural 
aspect of investment in Joint Ventures (JV) and 
Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (WOS), abroad. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Direct investment outside India means investment by way of contribution to the capital or subscription to the 
Memorandum of Association of a foreign entity, signifying a long term interest  (setting  up  a  Joint  Venture  (JV)  or  
a  Wholly  Owned  Subsidiary  (WOS)) overseas and thus does not include portfolio investment. 
LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL 
 
130 
INTRODUCTION 
Overseas investments (or financial commitment) in Joint Ventures (JV) and Wholly Owned Subsidiaries 
(WOS) have been recognised as important avenues for promoting global reach of Indian entrepreneurs. Joint 
Ventures are perceived as a medium of economic and business co-operation between India and other 
countries. 
"Financial Commitment" means the amount of direct investment by way of contribution to equity, loan and 
100 per cent of the amount of guarantees and 50 per cent of the performance guarantees issued by an 
Indian Party to or on behalf of its overseas Joint Venture Company or Wholly Owned Subsidiary. 
Direct investment outside India means investments, either under the Automatic Route or the Approval Route, 
by way of contribution to the capital or subscription to the Memorandum of a foreign entity or by way of 
purchase of existing shares of a foreign entity either by market purchase or private placement or through 
stock exchange, signifying a long-term interest in the foreign entity (JV or WOS). 
A foreign entity is termed as JV of the Indian Party when there are other foreign promoters holding the stake 
along with the Indian Party. In case of WOS entire capital is held by the one or more Indian Company. 
It may be noted that the Indian party/ Resident Individual is required to route all transactions in respect of a 
particular overseas JV/WOS only through one branch of an Authorized Dealer. This branch would be the 
‘designated Authorised Dealer’ in respect of that JV/WOS and all transactions and communications relating 
to the investment in that particular JV/WOS are to be reported only through this ‘designated’ branch of an 
Authorized Dealer.  
"Joint Venture (JV)"/ "Wholly Owned Subsidiary (WOS)" means a foreign entity formed, registered or 
incorporated in accordance with the laws and regulations of the host country in which the Indian party makes 
a direct investment. 
Approval Route 
The Government has adopted two way approach to the approval of direct investment, i.e. Automatic Route 
and Approval Route. 
Under the Automatic Route, an Indian Party does not require any prior approval from the Reserve Bank for 
making direct investments in a JV/WOS abroad. The Indian Party should approach an Authorized Dealer 
Category – I bank with an application in Form ODI and the prescribed enclosures / documents for effecting 
the remittances towards such investments. However, in case of investment in the financial services sector, 
prior approval is required from the regulatory authority concerned, both in India and abroad. 
Proposals not covered by the conditions under the automatic route require prior approval of the Reserve 
Bank for which a specific application in Form ODI with the documents prescribed therein is required to be 
made through Authorized Dealer Category – I banks. 
Proposal for making Overseas Direct Investment (ODI) under approval route 
The applicant should approach their designated Authorized Dealer (AD) with the proposal which is submitted 
to Reserve Bank after due scrutiny and with the specific recommendations of the designated AD bank along 
with supporting documents. 
The designated Authorised Dealer, before forwarding the proposal is reuired to submit the Form ODI in the 
on-line OID application under approval route and the transaction number generated by the application should 
be mentioned in the letter.  In case the proposal is approved, the AD bank should effect the remittance under 
advice to Reserve Bank so that the Unique Identification Number (UIN) is allotted. 
                                                                         Lesson 6         Overseas Direct Investments (ODI) 
 
131 
For approval by Reserve Bank, following documents need to be submitted along with Section D and Section 
E of From ODI - Part I by the designated Authorized Dealer: 
 
(a) A letter from the designated Authorised Dealer’ of the Indian party in a sealed cover mentioning the 
following details: 
 
• Transaction number generated by the OID application. 
 
• Brief details of the Indian entity. 
 
• Brief details of the overseas entity. 
 
• Background of the proposal, if any. 
 
• Brief details of the transaction. 
 
• Reason/s for seeking approval mentioning the extant FEMA provisions. 
 
• Observations of the designated AD bank with respect to the following: 
 
• Prima facie viability of the JV/ WOS outside India; 
 
• Contribution to external trade and other benefits which will accrue to India through such 
investment; 
 
• Financial position and business track record of the Indian Party (IP) and the foreign entity; 
 
• Expertise and experience of the IP in the same or related line of activity of the JV/ WOS outside 
India. 
 
• Recommendations of the designated AD bank. 
 
(b) A letter from the IP addressed to the designated AD bank. 
 
(c) Board resolution for the proposed transaction/s. 
 
(d) Diagrammatic representation of the organisational structure indicating all the subsidiaries of the IP 
horizontally and vertically with their stake (direct & indirect) and status (whether operating company 
or SPV). 
 
(e) Incorporation certificate and the valuation certificate for the overseas entity (if applicable). 
 
(f) Other relevant documents properly numbered, indexed and flagged. 
It may be noted that the Indian party/ Resident Individual is required to route all transactions in respect of a 
particular overseas JV/WOS only through one branch of an Authorized Dealer. This branch would be the 
‘designated Authorised Dealer’ in respect of that JV/WOS and all transactions and communications relating 
to the investment in that particular JV/WOS are to be reported only through this ‘designated’ branch of an 
Authorized Dealer.  
ODI transactions that require RBI approval 
Some of the proposals which require prior approval are: 
 
(i) Overseas Investments in the energy and natural resources sector exceeding the prescribed limit of 
net worth of Indian companies as on the date of the last audited balance sheet; 
 
(ii) Investments in Overseas Unincorporated entities in the oil sector by resident corporates exceeding 
the prescribed limit of their net worth as on the date of last audited balance sheet, provided the 
proposal has been approved by the competent authority and is duly supported by a certified copy of 
Board Resolution approving such investment. However, Navaratna Public Sector Undertakings, 
ONGC Videsh Ltd and Oil India Ltd are allowed to invest in overseas unincorporated / incorporated 
entities in oil sector (i.e. for exploration and drilling for oil and natural gas, etc.), which are duly 
approved by the Government of India, without any limits, under the automatic route; 
EP-EBCL 
 
132 
 
(iii) Overseas Investments by proprietorship concerns and unregistered partnership firms satisfying 
certain eligibility criteria; 
 
(iv) Investments by Registered Trusts / Societies (satisfying certain eligibility criteria) engaged in the 
manufacturing / educational / hospital sector in the same sector in a JV / WOS outside India; 
 
(v) Corporate guarantee by the Indian Party to second and subsequent level of Step Down Subsidiary 
(SDS); 
 
(vi) All other forms of guarantees which are offered by the Indian Party to its first and subsequent level 
of SDS; 
 (vii) Restructuring of the balance sheet of JV/WOS involving write-off of capital and receivables in the 
books of listed/ unlisted Indian Company satisfying certain eligibility; 
 (viii) Capitalization of export proceeds remaining unrealized beyond the prescribed period of realization 
to require prior approval of the Reserve Bank; and 
 
(ix) Proposals from the Indian party for undertaking financial commitment without equity contribution in 
JV / WOS may be considered by the Reserve Bank under the approval route based on the business 
requirement of Indian Party and legal requirement of host country in which JV/WOS is located.

Focus of the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 
The Foreign Trade Policy is primarily focused on accelerating exports. This is sought to be implemented 
through various schemes intended to exempt and remit indirect taxes on inputs physically incorporated in the 
export product, import capital goods at concessional duty, stimulate services exports and focus on specific 
markets and products. The Policy attempts to dovetail these schemes with the specific market access 
openings that India has achieved through negotiations with its trading partners for various bilateral and 
regional trading arrangements.

The Foreign Trade Policy  2015-20, is notified by Central Government, in exercise of powers conferred under 
Section 5 of the Foreign Trade (Development & Regulation) Act, 1992, as amended. The Foreign Trade 
Policy, 2015-20 came into force with effect from 01.04.2015

LESSON ROUND-UP 
• India’s Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) has, conventionally, been formulated for five years at a time and 
reviewed annually.  The  focus  of  the  FTP  has  been  to  provide  a  framework  of  rules  and  
procedures  for  exports  and imports and a set of incentives for promoting exports.  
• The Foreign  Trade  Policy  is  primarily  focused  on  accelerating  exports.  This  is  sought  to  be  
implemented through various schemes intended to exempt and remit indirect taxes on inputs physically 
incorporated  in the export  product,  import  capital  goods  at  concessional  duty,  stimulate  services  
exports  and  focus  on  specific markets and products.  
• The Foreign Trade Policy, 2015-20, is notified by Central Government, in exercise of powers conferred  
EP-EBCL 
 
198 
under Section 5 of the Foreign Trade (Development & Regulation) Act, 1992 (No. 22 of 1992) [FT (D&R) 
Act], as amended. The Foreign Trade Policy, 2015-20 came into force with effect from 01.04.2015.  
• Capital Goods means any plant, machinery, equipment or accessories required for manufacture or 
production, either  directly  or  indirectly,  of  goods  or  for  rendering  services,  including  those  required  
for  replacement, modernisation,  technological  up-gradation  or  expansion.  It  includes  packaging  
machinery  and  equipment, refrigeration equipment, power generating sets, machine tools, equipment and 
instruments for testing, research and development, quality and pollution control. 
• An  Importer-Exporter  Code  (IEC)  Number  is  a  10-digit  number  allotted  to  a  person  that  is  
mandatory  for undertaking  any  export/import  activities.  Now  the  facility  for  IEC  in  electronic  form  or  
e-IEC  has  also  been  operationalised.  
• The  objective  of  the  Export  from  India  Schemes  is  to  provide  rewards  to  exporters  to  offset  
infrastructural inefficiencies and associated costs involved and to provide exporters a level playing field.  
• Status Holders are business leaders who have excelled in international trade and have successfully 
contributed to country’s foreign trade. Status Holders are expected to not only contribute towards India’s 
exports but also provide guidance and handholding to new entrepreneurs. 
• The objective of the Export Promotion Capital Goods(EPCG) Scheme is to facilitate import of capital goods 
for producing quality goods and services to enhance India’s export competitiveness.  
• Units undertaking to export their entire production of goods and services (except permissible sales in DTA), 
may be set up under the Export Oriented Unit (EOU) Scheme, Electronics Hardware Technology Park 
(EHTP) Scheme, Software Technology Park (STP) Scheme or Bio-Technology Park (BTP) Scheme for 
manufacture of goods,  including  repair,  re-making,  reconditioning, re-engineering,  rendering  of

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
The NBFC (Non-Banking Finance Company) sector 
has grown in size and complexity over the years. The 
Reserve Bank of India is entrusted with the 
responsibility of regulating and supervising the Non-
Banking Financial Companies by virtue of powers 
vested in Chapter III B of the Reserve Bank of India 
Act, 1934. 
The  object  of  the study  is  to  familiarize  the  
students  with  the Non-Banking Financial Company 
(NBFC) engaged in the business of loans and 
advances, acquisition of shares/stocks/ bonds/ 
debentures/securities issued by Government or local 
authority or other marketable securities of a like

LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL

INTRODUCTION 
The Reserve Bank of India is entrusted with the responsibility of regulating and supervising the Non-Banking 
Financial Companies by virtue of powers vested in Chapter III B of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. The 
regulatory and supervisory objective, is to: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) is a company registered under the Companies Act, engaged in 
the business of loans and advances, acquisition of shares/stocks/bonds/debentures/securities issued by 
Government or local authority or other marketable securities of a like nature, leasing, hire-purchase, 
insurance business, chit business but does not include any institution whose principal business is that of 
agriculture activity, industrial activity, purchase or sale of any goods (other than securities) or providing any 
services and sale/purchase/construction of immovable property 
A non-banking institution which is a company and has principal business of receiving deposits under any 
scheme or arrangement in one lump sum or in installments by way of contributions or in any other manner, is 
also a non-banking financial company (Residuary non-banking company). 
NBFCs lend and make investments and hence their activities are akin to that of banks; however there are 
few differences such as: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Registration with RBI 
A company incorporated under the Companies Act and desirous of commencing business of non-banking 
financial companies 
NBFC cannot accept demand deposits 
Deposit insurance facility of Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation 
is not available to depositors of NBFC’s, unlike in the case of banks 
Ensure healthy growth of financial companies 
Ensure that these companies function as a part of the financial system within the 
policy framework, in such a manner that their existence and functioning do not lead 
to systemic aberrations 
The quality of surveillance and supervision exercised by the Bank over the NBFC’s is 
sustained by keeping pace with the developments that take place in this sector of the 
financial system. 
NBFC’s do not form part of the payment and settlement system and 
cannot issue cheques drawn on itself 
                                                                         Lesson 10         Non-Banking Financial Companies 201 
financial institution as defined under Section 45 I(a) of the RBI Act, 1934 should comply with the following: 
 
i. it should be a company registered under the Companies Act, and 
 
ii. It should have a minimum net owned fund. 
It may be noted that ‘Owned Fund’ means aggregate of the paid-up equity capital, preference shares which 
are compulsorily convertible into equity, free reserves, balance in share premium account and capital 
reserves representing surplus arising out of sale proceeds of asset, excluding reserves created by 
revaluation of asset, after deducting therefrom accumulated balance of loss, deferred revenue expenditure 
and other intangible assets.  
'Net Owned Fund' is the amount as arrived at above, minus the amount of investments of such company in 
shares of its subsidiaries, companies in the same group and all other NBFCs and the book value of 
debentures, bonds, outstanding loans and advances including hire purchase and lease finance made to and 
deposits with subsidiaries and companies in the same group, to the extent it exceeds 10% of the owned 
fund. 
In terms of Section 45-IA of the RBI Act, 1934, no Non-banking Financial company can commence or carry 
on business of a non-banking financial institution without obtaining a certificate of registration from the 
Reserve Bank. 
However, in terms of the powers given to the Bank, to obviate dual regulation, certain categories of NBFCs 
which are regulated by other regulators are exempted from the requirement of registration with RBI viz. 
Venture Capital Fund/Merchant Banking companies/Stock broking companies registered with SEBI, 
Insurance Company holding a valid Certificate of Registration issued by IRDA, Nidhi companies as notified 
under the Companies Act,  Chit companies as defined in clause (b) of Section 2 of the Chit Funds Act, 
1982,Housing Finance Companies regulated by National Housing Bank, Stock Exchange or a Mutual Benefit 
company.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Special  Economic  Zones  (SEZ)  are  growth  
engines that  can  boost  manufacturing,  augment  
exports  and generate employment. The SEZs 
require special fiscal and regulatory regime in order 
to 
impart 
a 
hassle 
free 
operational 
regime 
encompassing the state of the art infrastructure and 
support services.  
Special  Economic  Zone  (SEZ)  is  a  specifically 
delineated duty free enclave and shall be deemed to 
be  foreign  territory  for  the  purposes  of  trade 
operations and duties and tariffs. Goods and services 
going  into  the  SEZ  area  from  Domestic  Tariff  
Area treated  as  exports  and  goods  coming  from  
the  SEZ area into DTA treated as if these are being 
imported.  
SEZ units may  be  set  up  for  manufacture  of  
goods and rendering of services. The Government  
of  India  had  announced  a  Special Economic Zone 
scheme in April, 2000 with a view to provide an 
internationally competitive environment  for exports.  
To  instil  confidence  in  investors  and  signal the 
Government's commitment to a stable SEZ policy 
regime and with a view to impart stability to the SEZ 
regime  thereby  generating  greater  economic  
activity and employment through the establishment of 
SEZs, the  Special  Economic  Zones Act,  2005,  
was  passed by Parliament in 2005.  
The  object  of  the study  is  to  familiarize  the  
students, how Special Economic Zones Act  provides  
single  window  approval  mechanism, establishment  
of  Authority,  Off-Shore  Banking  Units and Special 
Court for Special Economic Zones. 
 
  
SEZ  Act,  2005  to  provide  for  the  establishment,  development  and  management  of  the  Special  Economic 
Zones for the promotion of exports and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.  
LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL 
220 
INTRODUCTION 
While the policy relating to the Special Economic Zones is contained in the Foreign Trade Policy, incentives 
and other facilities offered to the Special Economic Zone developer and units are implemented through 
various notifications and circulars issued by the concerned Ministries/Departments. The system, therefore, 
did not lend enough confidence for investors to commit substantial funds for development of infrastructure 
and for setting up of the units in the Zones for export of goods and services. In order to give a long term and 
stable policy framework with minimum regulatory regime and to provide expeditious and single window 
clearance mechanism, the Government enacted Special Economic Zones Act, 2005.  
The salient features of the Act are as under:— 
 
(i) matters relating to establishment of Special Economic Zone and for setting up of units therein, 
including requirements, obligations and entitlements; 
 
(ii) matters relating to requirements for setting up of off-shore banking units and units in International 
Financial Service Center in Special Economic Zone, including fiscal regime governing the operation 
of such units; 
 (iii) the fiscal regime for developers of Special Economic Zones and units set up therein; 
 (iv) single window clearance mechanism at the Zone level; 
 
(v) establishment of an Authority for each Special Economic Zone set up by the Central Government to 
impart greater administrative autonomy; and 
 (vi) designation of special courts and single enforcement agency to ensure speedy trial and 
investigation of notified offences committed in Special Economic Zones.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Competition refers to a situation in a market place in 
which firms/ entities or sellers independently strive 
for the patronage of buyers in order to achieve a 
particular business objective, such as profits, sales, 
market share etc. Competition is not an end unto 
itself, rather a means to achieve economic efficiency 
and welfare objectives. Free and fair competition is 
one of the pillars of an efficient market economy. 
Therefore, competition has become a driving force in 
the global economy.  
Indian economy is on a high growth path. In the 
recent years the Indian economy has been one of the 
strongest performers in the world. However, the full 
growth potential of the economy remains yet to be 
realised. Infusion of greater degree of competition 
can play a catalytic role in unlocking the fuller growth 
potential in many critical areas of the economy, 
which hitherto has been held back by restriction on 
competition in various forms. 
The object of the study is to familiarize the students 
regarding anti-competitive agreements, abuse of 
dominance, Combination, competition Advocacy, 
Competition Commission of India. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
The Competition Act, 2002 to provide, keeping in view of the economic development of the country, for the 
establishment of a Commission to prevent practices having adverse effect on competition, to promote and sustain 
competition in the markets, to protect the interest of consumers and to ensure freedom of trade carried on by other 
participant in the markets in India and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
 
LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL 
236 
INTRODUCTION 
There is a growing recognition that a flexible, dynamic and competitive private sector is essential to fostering 
sustained economic development. Promoting effective competition spurs firms to focus on efficiency and 
improves consumer welfare by offering greater choice of higher-quality products and services at lower prices. 
It also promotes greater accountability and transparency in government-business relations and decision 
making, helps reduce corruption, lobbying, and rent seeking. In addition, it provides opportunities for broadly 
based participation in the economy and for sharing in the benefits of economic growth.  
The idea of competition has had, for two centuries or more, a powerful influence on the way we think about 
our society, the way we organise things and the way we conduct our own economic and personal lives. The 
competition being an essential element in the efficient working of markets encourages enterprise and 
efficiency and widens choice. By encouraging efficiency in industry, competition in the domestic market 
whether between domestic companies alone or between those and overseas companies also contribute to 
international competitiveness. The full benefits of competition are, however, felt in markets that are open to 
trade and investment.  
Economic theory suggests that prices and quantities in a competitive market equilibrate to levels that 
generate efficient outcomes at a given point of time. Competition is therefore, beneficial as it provides to 
consumers wider choice and provides sellers with stronger incentives to minimize costs, so eliminating 
waste. Competition increases the likelihood that cost savings resulting from efficiency gains will be passed 
on to a firm's customers, who may be either final consumers or intermediary customers (in which case costs 
of those firms are also lowered). Ample empirical evidence supports these arguments. The importance of 
competition for achieving a higher rate of innovation and adoption of new technologies over time is critical for 
sustaining rapid growth. Yet it is not automatic and is not the same as laissez faire. 
In fact, there are reasons to believe that less mature markets tend to be more, rather than less, vulnerable to 
anti-competitive practices than the markets of developed countries. Reasons include: (a) high "natural" entry 
barriers due to inadequate business infrastructure, including distribution channels, and (sometimes) intrusive 
regulatory regimes; (b) asymmetries of information in both product and credit markets; and (c) a greater 
proportion of local (non-tradable) markets. Competition also serves to diffuse socio-economic power, 
broadening participation in economic, social, and political advances while ensuring opportunities for new 
entrepreneurs. Moreover, it can facilitate realization of the benefits for the domestic economy of integrating 
into international trade and investment patterns. 
Several studies have demonstrated the stimulating effects of competitive markets in terms of growth and 
prosperity. William Lewis in his book, The Power of Productivity underlines this point forcefully with his 
observations on the growth of productivity in the late 1990s in the United States. The author has argued that 
more than technology and other factors, what matters above all is competition. Similarly, economist Paul 
London in his book, The Competition Solution concludes that heightened competition in the US over-
shadowed tax cuts or new technologies in explaining the prosperity of the 1990s. Competitive pressures 
helped suppress inflation and raise living standards through improved productivity. The author noted that 
competition from imports forced the steel and auto industry, among other manufacturers, to streamline, 
thereby pushing manufacturing productivity up by 4% a year. Competition has brought down real air fares, 
telephone rates and several other costs. Where jobs have been lost in one industry, these have been more 
than compensated by jobs created elsewhere; thus employment has not suffered but has shifted from losers 
to winners. This argument underlines across the board, the benefits of competition to a wide sections of 
society, including consumers, workers and many others.

Definition of Competition 
Competition is a complex and technical subject which does not lend itself to easy summary or concise 
clarification. Of late, with globalisation and opening of the markets worldwide, it has become a subject of 
great practical importance. It involves the establishment and development of concepts, legal principles and 
policies for the benefit of consumer interest. The principles and policies are applied to a wide range of private 
agreements and arrangements, which commercial undertakings enter into for themselves or with each other. 
In addition, they also apply to the policies and directions of the Government.  
In the absence of a generally accepted definition of the phenomenon of competition, it has to be regarded as 
the object fostered and protected by competition policy and law. The World Bank and OECD in its Report A 
Framework for the Design and Implementation of Competition Law and Policy, broadly defines the 
competition is “a situation in a market in which firms or sellers independently strive for the buyers’ patronage 
in order to achieve a particular business objective, for example, profits, sales or market share.” 
Competition can also be defined as a process of economic rivalry between market players to attract 
customers. These market players can be multinational or domestic companies, wholesalers, retailers, or 
even the neighborhood shopkeeper. In their pursuit to outdo rival enterprises, market players either adopt fair 
means (producing quality goods, being cost efficient, adopting appropriate technologies, etc.) or indulge in 
unfair measures (carrying out restrictive business practices – such as predatory pricing, exclusive dealing, 
tied selling, collusion, cartelisation, abuse of dominant position, etc.). However, in the interest of consumers, 
and the economy as a whole, it is necessary to promote an environment that facilitates fair competitive 
outcomes in the market, curb anti-competitive behaviour and discourage market players from adopting unfair 
measures. 
 
What is competition in the market? 
In common parlance, competition in the market means sellers striving independently 
for buyers’ patronage to maximize profit (or other business objectives).A buyer 
prefers to buy a product at a price that maximizes his benefits whereas the seller 
prefers to sell the product at a price that maximizes his profit. 
Competition and Economic Efficiency 
A number of empirical studies found a positive relationship between competition and innovation, productivity 
and economic growth. P. Aghion and P. Howitt in Endogenous Growth Theory offered several theoretical 
situations where competition is conducive to innovation – Intensified product market competition could force 
managers to speed up the adoption of new technologies; Intensive product market competition with 
incumbent firms engaged in step by step innovative activities could enhance each firms incentive to acquire 
or increase its technological lead over its rivals and, if labour markets are flexible, competition will induce 
skilled workers to move to opportunities employing best practices and technologies. Competition also 
reduces slack by providing more incentives for managers and workers to increase efforts and improve 
efficiency. Therefore, the product market competition disciplines firms into efficient operation.  
Nickel et. al. in his article Competition and Corporate Performance suggested three different channels of 
incentives – competition creates greater opportunities for comparing performance; a more competitive 
environment where price elasticity of demand tends to be higher, induces greater efforts among workers and 
managers for cost reducing improvements in productivity since improvements could generate larger increase 
in revenue and profits; and a more competitive environment forces managers to improve efficiency, because 
more intense the competition, greater the chances for inefficient to be extinguished.

UK White Paper on World Class Competition Regime clearly brings out the importance of competition in an 
increasingly innovative and globalised economy. Vigorous competition between firms is the lifeblood of 
strong and effective markets. Competition helps consumers get a good deal. It encourages firms to innovate 
by reducing slack, putting downward pressure on costs and providing incentives for the efficient organisation 
of production. 
Empirical evidences show that strong competition is closely linked to dynamic and efficient markets. The 
benefits of competitive forces for economic growth and consumer welfare are widely recognized and 
evidenced by several studies. Recently, an empirical study in the U.K. by the Centre for Competition Policy, 
University of East Anglia showed that prices were more than halved through competition in international 
telephony and airfares, and were significantly reduced in other areas. The survey also brought home the 
point that competition is not just about prices but is typically multi-faceted, bringing new ways of doing 
business and leading to technological and other advances. 
Michel Porter in his recent work Can Japan Compete? shows that in Japan only those sectors characterized 
by strong domestic competition remain internationally competitive following the country's recent economic 
downturn, examples include cameras, automobiles and audio equipment. Many leading competition experts 
believe in the premise that, in the presence of competition, the market will achieve the objective of 
maximising welfare.  
Competition Law and Policy 
The World Bank and OECD in its Report A Framework for the Design and Implementation of Competition 
Law and Policypointed out that a dynamic and competitive environment, underpinned by sound competition 
law and policy, is an essential characteristic of a successful market economy. Effective enforcement of 
competition law and active competition advocacy can also be powerful catalysts for successful economic 
restructuring. This in turn fosters flexibility and mobility of resources, which in the current global business 
environment are critical elements for the competitiveness of firms and industries across nations. Although the 
field of competition law and policy is evolving rapidly and includes many different viewpoints on specific 
issues, recognition is growing that effective competition law is important in shaping business culture and that 
its proper implementation needs to allow for the education of business people, government officials, the 
judiciary, and the interested public.  
 
The basic purpose of Competition Policy and law is to preserve and promote 
competition as a means of ensuring efficient allocation of resources in an economy. 
Competition policy typically has two elements: one is a set of policies that enhance 
competition in local and national markets. The second element is legislation 
designed to prevent anti-competitive business practices with minimal Government intervention, i.e., 
a competition law. Competition law by itself cannot produce or ensure competition in the market 
unless this is facilitated by appropriate Government policies. On the other hand, Government 
policies without a law to enforce such policies and prevent competition malpractices would also be 
incomplete. 
Competition policies cover a much broader set of instruments than competition law and typically include all 
policies aimed at increasing the intensity of competition or rivalry in local and national markets by lowering 
entry barriers and opportunities for harmful coordination, to ensure that markets work effectively and serve 
the interests of all citizens. Competition law is only a subset of a nation's competition policies. Competition 
policies typically include pro-competition approaches to trade, investment, sectoral regulation, and consumer 
protection. The barriers to international or interregional trade, restrictions on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
239 
and technology transfers, restrictions on entry in regulated network utility industries, regulations affecting the 
registration of new enterprises and the taxation and corporate governance of existing enterprises and rules 
on marketing practices all influence the extent of competitive pressures in markets and so are appropriate 
concerns of competition policies. In many countries, competition authorities have become the focal point for 
consultations and putting forward pro-competition viewpoints across a broad range of policy areas. 
Asian Development Bank in “During economic transition or reforms”, observed that “the benefits of an open 
market economy cannot be fully realized unless restrictions on competition are removed. Opening markets is 
not enough by itself for countries to begin reaping the benefits of competition; firms will still find incentives to 
engage in anti-competitive practices. Thus, the intended benefits of trade reforms may not be realized 
without active enforcement of competition law. This highlights the importance of having faith in the benefits of 
competition from an early stage of economic growth and of incorporating competition policy into the broader 
economic policy framework.” 
Prof. Paul Geroski, former Chairman, Competition Commission of the United Kingdom observed that 
“Competition policy is about ensuring that markets are, and remain, competitive. This brings benefits to 
consumers eventually in all the ways. However, eliminating anti-competitive practices and dismantling 
monopoly positions that lead to abuses also benefit firms whose business suffers from these practices and 
abuses. It is worth emphasizing that many of the benefits that emanate from proper application of 
competition policy are felt in the first instance by firms. This is important for those who seem to think of 
competition policy as an added and unnecessary burden on business. Competition policy is sometimes a 
burden on business, but only on those businesses that try to unfairly disadvantage their rivals in ways that 
reduce their competitive abilities or incentives to compete vigorously”. 
Hence, competition policy and competition law need to be distinguished. The former can be regarded as a 
genus, of which, the latter is specie.  
COMPETITION REGIME IN INDIA 
 
Historical Perspective 
The Indian economy remained subject to controls and regulations for several decades, such as industrial 
licensing, foreign exchange restrictions, small scale industry protection, control on foreign investment and 
technologies, quantitative restrictions on imports, administered prices, and control on capital issues. The 
domestic industry was thus insulated from competition. 
The economic consequences of this policy regime, though initially beneficial, were reflected in a poor rate of 
economic growth, low levels of productivity and efficiency, absence of international competitiveness, sub-
optimal size of businesses, and outdated and inefficient technologies in various sectors.  
India has therefore witnessed two phases of development process with different policy regimes and 
institutional frameworks. In the first phase, since independence, the transformation and development of the 
Indian economy took place within a planned, rigidly regulated and relatively closed economic framework. In 
the second phase, since 1991, when the country embarked upon reform process and embraced market 
oriented policies.  
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, need for liberalization policies was recognized and a range of policy and 
regulatory reforms were initiated, such as delicensing of industry, shrinking the monopoly of the public sector 
industries (other than those where strategic and security concerns dominated), removal of quantitative 
restrictions on imports, market determined exchange rate, liberalization of foreign direct investment, capital 
market reforms, liberalizing the financial markets, reduction in small scale industry reservations, and a much 
EP-EBCL 
240 
greater role for the private sector in infrastructure industries such as power, port, transport and 
communications.  
Economic Reforms and Competition 
The world economy has been experiencing a progressive international economic integration for the last half 
a century. There has been a marked acceleration in this process of globalisation and also liberalisation 
during the last three decades.  
Since 1991, the Government of India has introduced a series of economic reforms, including policies of 
liberalisation, deregulation, disinvestment and privatisation. The seriousness of macroeconomic imbalances 
and unanimity towards reform rendered this possible. The broad thrust of the new policies was a move away 
from the centralised allocation of resources in some key sectors by the government to allocation by market 
forces. Private participation in economic development has emerged as an alternative to the state-oriented 
development strategy in the reform period.  
After a decade of reforms, restraints to competition such as state monopolies and protective measures and 
controls have been replaced by relatively more competitive and de-regulated open market policies. In the 
post reform period, the private sector participation in production and supply of utility services has increased 
substantially. Independent regulators have been established for many sectors such as road, power, 
telecommunications and insurance. These sectoral regulators have been empowered to determine sector 
specific entry conditions and eventually the level of competition. In nutshell, post reforms period witnessed 
an open market orientation in industrial policy, foreign trade policy, foreign investment policy and financial 
sector policy, infrastructure policy, etc.  
Competition Law-Evolution and Development 
The first Indian competition law was enacted in 1969 and was christened as the Monopolies and Restrictive 
Trade Practices Act, 1969 (MRTP Act). The genesis of the MRTP Act, 1969 is traceable to Articles 38 and 39 
of the Constitution of India. The Directive Principle of State Policy in those Articles lays down, inter-alia that 
the State shall strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing and protecting as effectively, as it may, 
a social order in which justice - social, economic and political- shall inform all the institutions of the national 
life, and the State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing: 
 
1. that the ownership and control of material resources of the community are so distributed as best to 
subserve the common good; and  
 
2. that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and means 
of production to the common detriment. 
Legal framework dealing with competition in India spread over other legislations, besides the Monopolies and 
Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969, other legislations dealing with competition include Consumer 
Protection Act, 1986, the Patents Act 1970 etc.  
Background to the MRTP Act, 1969 
India, when it became free from the colonial power was industrially very backward. In fact, it inherited an 
economy in a ravaged condition. Under development of the economy in many respects led the successor 
Government to adopt a system of planning. In the interest of transformation of the backward industrial 
economy into an advanced industrial economy, the planners thought it fit to allow the then established 
industries to develop and grow further. Alongside, mixed economy was also developed as a concept of 
economic planning. No doubt, there was perceptible growth in industrialisation. However, this also brought 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
241 
on its trails, concentration of wealth and economic power. This led to widening of the difference between the 
haves and have nots in the society. The Government of India therefore set up the Monopolies Inquiry 
Commission in 1964 with a view to finding out the causes, the nature and the extent of concentration of 
economic power in the country and to suggest remedial measures therefor. 
The Monopolies Inquiry Commission submitted a detailed report in October 1965 which was well 
documented and revelatory of many facets of concentration of economic power. Many of the trade practices 
which were designed to stifle competition in the market and to promote monopolistic tendency were also 
noticed by the Commission in the course of its inquiry. The Commission observed that there was no need to 
strike at the concentration of economic power as such but to do so only when it became a menace to the 
best production in quality and quantity or to fair distribution. Monopolistic conditions in any industrial sphere 
should be discouraged without injury to the interests of the general public and monopolistic and restrictive 
trade practices should be curbed except when they were conducive to the common good. The Commission 
pointed out that on the one hand over the years certain business houses had built vast industrial empires 
and on the other hand they were trying to accentuate and enlarge the empires by adopting certain trade 
practices which were intended to distort competition in the market and promote a set of near monopoly 
conditions. The Commission felt that such tendencies seemed to destroy the basic concept of socio-
economic justice enshrined in the Constitution. The Commission also framed a draft Bill as a part of its 
recommendations.  
The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Bill was introduced in Parliament in 1967 which after being 
referred to the Joint Select Committee became an Act and finally came into force w.e.f. 1st June, 1970. 
The enactment was based on the socio-economic philosophy enshrined in the Directive Principles of State 
Policy contained in the Constitution which provides that the State shall direct its policy towards securing that 
the ownership and control of material resources of the community are distributed as best to subserve the 
common good and that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth 
and means of production to the common detriment. 
The principal objectives of the Act, as spelt out in the preamble were: 
 
(i) prevention of concentration of economic power to the common detriment; 
 
(ii) control of monopolies; 
 
(iii) prohibition of monopolistic trade practice; 
 
(iv) prohibition of restrictive trade practices. 
The MRTP Act, 1969 underwent amendments in 1974, 1980, 1982, 1984, 1986, 1988 and 1991. Major 
changes introduced in the 1982 and 1984 Amendment Acts were based on the recommendations of the 
Sachar Committee. The 1984 amendment introduced the concept of unfair trade practice under the Act. Far-
reaching changes have been brought about by the 1991 amendment and these were made in the wake of 
new industrial policy of July, 1991 which is wedded to liberalisation, globalisation and de-regulation. 
Scheme of the MRTP Act 
Prevention of undesirable concentration of economic power was sought to be achieved essentially through 
the regulation of growth of undertakings of particular size, viz. undertakings having assets of the value of 
`100 crores. These business houses were officially designated as large business houses. Undertakings 
having a sizable share of the market, or licensed production capacity of more than 1/4th of the total 
production or installed capacity in India were described as dominant undertakings. These companies were 
declared large business houses if their assets were of the value of `1 crore or more. 
EP-EBCL 
242 
These undertakings were referred to as MRTP undertakings. Such undertakings had to obtain approval of 
the Central Government to undertake substantial expansion of production, establishment of new 
undertakings, amalgamate with or takeover any other undertaking. Appointment of persons who were 
directors in such undertakings as director in any other undertaking needed the approval of the Central 
Government. The Central Government also had the power to order for division of such undertakings or for 
severance of interconnection under certain circumstances. Restrictions were placed on the acquisition and 
transfer of shares of, or by, bodies corporate owning such undertakings. 
However, the MRTP (Amendment) Act, 1991 sought to liberalise these restrictions by removing the concept 
of MRTP undertakings and provisions relating to their substantial expansion, amalgamation etc., and 
acquisition of shares of, or by, such undertakings etc. The provisions relating to Central Governments power 
to direct division of undertakings or severance of interconnection have been modified such that they apply to 
all undertakings (hitherto, they applied only to MRTP undertakings). 
Chapter IV deals with monopolistic trade practices indulged in by any undertaking. The Act defines the 
concept of monopolistic trade practices in terms of unreasonableness of the prices charged, 
unreasonableness in preventing or lessening competition in the market, unreasonably increasing prices, 
profits and limiting technical development to the common detriment etc. The remedy for dealing with 
monopolistic trade practice is an inquiry at the instance of the Central Government by the M.R.T.P. 
Commission or suo motu by the Commission and suitable orders being passed by the Central Government 
thereafter to prevent the mischief resulting from such practices. 
The Act also deals with matters relating to restrictive trade practices. Briefly stated, a restrictive trade 
practice is one which prevents, distorts or restricts competition for goods and services in any manner. While 
unreasonableness is the test for monopolistic trade practices, even a small distortion in competition is 
sufficient to bring a case under restrictive trade practices. The provisions relating to restrictive trade practices 
are therefore intended to promote fair and free competition in the market. The Act provides for a scheme of 
registration of certain agreements relating to restrictive trade practices. The MRTP (Amendment) Act, 1984 
introduced new provisions relating to unfair trade practices with a view to promoting the interest of 
consumers. It is essential to note that the M.R.T.P. Commission has been given full powers to regulate 
restrictive and unfair trade practices by means of an inquiry and pass final orders thereon. The MRTP 
Commission may inquire into restrictive and unfair trade practices at the instance of the Central Government, 
State Government, Director General of Investigation and Registration, registered consumer associations, 
individual consumer and on its own. The Commission has also powers to grant temporary injunctions and 
award compensation and punish for contempt under Sections 12A, 12B and 13B of the Act respectively. 
The Commission is an independent quasi-judicial body and has powers similar to a Civil Court under the 
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 on some matters. The Director General of Investigation and Registration and 
the Secretary of the Commission assist in the inquiry in respect of monopolistic, restrictive and unfair trade 
practices. The Commission conducts enquiries and other businesses in accordance with MRTPC 
Regulations, 1991. 
The Central Government has framed the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Rules, 1970, the 
Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (Classification of Goods) Rules, 1971, and the M.R.T.P. 
(Information) Rules, 1971 in exercise of the powers conferred under the Act. However these Rules have lost 
much of their significance in view of deletion of Sections 21 to 26 of the Act w.e.f. 27.9.91. 
MRTP (Amendment) Act, 1991 
The new industrial policy announced by the Government in Parliament on July 24, 1991 sought to amend the 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
243 
MRTP Act, 1969 by removing all pre-entry restrictions and placing more emphasis on controlling and 
regulating monopolistic, restrictive and unfair trade practices. 
The ‘Statement of Objects and Reasons to the MRTP (Amendment) Act, 1991 reiterates that the basic 
philosophy behind the MRTP Act, 1969 was not to inhibit industrial growth but to ensure that industrial 
growth was channelised for public good and growth did not perpetuate concentration of economic power to 
the common detriment. To quote, 
 
1. With the growing complexity of industrial structure and the need for achieving economies of scale 
for ensuring higher productivity and competitive advantage in the international market, the thrust of 
the industrial policy has shifted to controlling and regulating the monopolistic, restrictive and unfair 
trade practices rather than making it necessary for certain undertakings to obtain prior approval of 
the Central Government for expansion, establishment of new undertakings, merger, amalgamation, 
take over and appointment of directors. It has been the experience of the Government that pre-entry 
restrictions under the MRTP Act on the investment decision of the corporate sector has outlived its 
utility and has become a hindrance to the speedy implementation of industrial projects. By 
eliminating the requirement of time-consuming procedures and prior approval of the Government, it 
would be possible for all productive sections of the society to participate in efforts for maximisation 
of production. It is, therefore, proposed to re-structure the MRTP Act by omitting the provisions of 
Sections 20 to 26 and transfer the provisions contained in Chapter III-A regarding restrictions on 
acquisition and transfer of shares to the Companies Act, 1956. The Schedule to the MRTP Act is 
also consequently to be transferred with modification to the Companies Act, 1956. 
 
2. It is also proposed to enlarge the scope of inquiry by the MRTP Commission with a view to taking 
effective steps to curb and regulate monopolistic, restrictive and unfair trade practices which are 
prejudicial to public interest. It is also proposed to provide for deterrent punishment for 
contravention of the orders passed by the MRTP Commission and the Central Government and 
empower the Commission to punish for its contempt. Certain other consequential changes are also 
found necessary in the MRTP Act. 
Scope and Applicability of the MRTP Act 
Section 3 of the MRTP Act, 1969 provides that unless the Central Government, by notification in the Official 
Gazette otherwise directs, the Act shall not apply to: 
 
(a) undertakings owned or controlled by the Government, a government company, a corporation, a 
registered cooperative society and undertakings, the management of which has been taken over by 
the Central Government; 
 
(b) trade unions and other associations of workmen; 
 
(c) financial institutions. 
However, vide notification dated 27.9.1991, the Government has directed that the provisions of the MRTP 
Act shall apply to all undertakings and financial institutions specified in Section 3 which were hitherto outside 
the purview of the Act, except undertakings owned or controlled by a Government company, or the 
Government and engaged in the production of arms and ammunition and allied items of defence equipment, 
defence aircraft and warships, atomic energy, minerals specified in the schedule to the Atomic Energy 
(Control of Production and Use) Order, 1953 and industrial units under the Currency and Coinage Division, 
Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs. Thus, the hitherto anomaly which used to exist prior to 
27.9.91 about applicability of provisions of Act between private sector enterprises and public sector 
undertakings and those stated in sub-clause (a) to (g) of Section 3, has been removed. 
EP-EBCL 
244 
But trade unions and other associations of workmen or employees formed for their own reasonable 
protection as such workmen or employees continue to be exempt from the applicability of the MRTP Act. 
However, Truck owners or operators Unions/Associations being not of workmen have been held to be 
subject to the jurisdiction of MRTP Commission by Supreme Court in the case of Bharatpur Truck Operators 
Union. 
In effect, all public sector companies, except those engaged in the production of arms and ammunition etc. 
and industries under the Currency and Coinage Division, have been brought within the scope of the MRTP 
Act in respect of monopolistic, restrictive and unfair trade practices. 
MONOPOLISTIC TRADE PRACTICES 
Prohibition of monopolistic trade practices is one of the objects of the MRTP Act, 1969. The word ‘monopoly’ 
has not been defined in the MRTP Act. But it is common knowledge that a pure monopoly as well as 
‘monopolistic’ position leads to distortion of competition in the market, besides endangering in the normal 
circumstances concerted action to fix prices, supplies of commodities, etc. The result of such action is no 
doubt detrimental to the consuming public. 
The Monopolies Inquiry Commission made copious analysis of this aspect in its report. It is worth quoting the 
following passages from Chapter V of the report: 
Our study of product-wise concentration brings out prominently the fact that in a large number of industries, a 
single undertaking is the only supplier or at least has to its credit a very large portion of the market as 
compared with its competitors. Such an undertaking has the power to dictate the price of the commodity or 
services it supplies and to regulate its volume of production in such a manner as to maximize its profits. This 
power is what is generally understood by the words “monopoly power" Though in the strict etymological 
sense of the word, and in strict economic theory, monopoly exists when there is only one single supplier, 
there is no reason why an enterprise enjoying the power to dictate the price and thus to control the market 
even though it is not the single supplier should not be considered a monopoly. What happens in such cases 
is that the price decided upon by the dominant producer (or distributor) is followed by others who are in a 
position to compete. This price leadership phenomenon is in essence a manifestation of the price leaders 
power to dictate the price in the market. We think it proper therefore to include within the word monopoly not 
only the single supplier in a market but also the one dominant supplier who has the power to dictate the price 
in the market." 
“The question that next arises is : When such a power is shared by a few enterprises being the dominant 
sellers, should they be considered to be holding a monopolistic position? We see no reason to exclude such 
dominant sellers from our understanding of monopoly. For, the essence of monopoly is the ability to dictate 
the price and control the market without being materially influenced by other competing concerns.” 
One important difference between the situation when a single seller dominates the market and a few 
independent sellers together enjoy a dominating position cannot be overlooked. In the former case, 
monopoly power is inevitably present, in the latter it may or not be present. The effect on the market of a few 
dominant sellers has been widely discussed by economists, specially in recent years; but their opinions are 
by no means the same. We do not propose to try to resolve this controversy. It is sufficient for our purpose to 
notice that it is generally agreed that when a few big sellers dominate the market there will ordinarily be a 
high probability of their coming to some kind of agreement or understanding whether formal or not, about the 
price and output, by which a monopolistic power is shared between themselves. Even in the absence of such 
agreement or understanding it frequently happens that each has a healthy fear of the other big producers or 
distributors and ultimately a policy of live and let live comes into operation. Some economists point out that 
 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
245 
when a few large sellers dominate the market, each of them is able to calculate fairly and accurately the 
probable effect on the market of his action in increasing or decreasing his output. So, it is said that each will 
try to regulate the output in such a way that the marginal costs remain well below the price. Each such seller 
will also be well aware that any attempt of his to reduce the price is likely to be met immediately by similar 
action by his competitors. The matter is succinctly put by Stocking in Monopoly and Free Enterprise at p. 90 
thus: 
“In markets where sellers are few, each in trying to determine his most profitable volume of output must, as 
would a monopolist, consider the probable effects of various possible rates of production not only on costs 
but also on prices. Indeed each seller will ordinarily decide on the price at which he will sell and adjust his 
output accordingly, just as a monopolist does. Each oligopolist however in determining his price must 
consider not merely his own cost-price relationships but also how his rivals will react to his prices. Anyone of 
a few sellers, if fully informed and perfectly rational, when selling a completely standardised product will 
realise that if he reduces his prices his rivals will meet the lower price promptly. 
For all these reasons, we are convinced that when the market is dominated by a few sellers, monopolistic 
conditions will sometimes prevail. At the same time, we are conscious that even in a market of a few sellers, 
there will sometimes be keen competition. This is likely to happen apart from the effect of the mutual 
jealousies which sometimes characterise the relations between big business houses when one or more of 
the few sellers feel confident that due to superior managerial ability and technical skill and financial 
resources they will be able to capture a larger share of the market at the expense of their rivals. Even so, 
there is no gainsaying the fact that in a market of a few dominating sellers, there is real risk of the 
emergence of monopolistic power and consequently of monopolistic practices. To ascertain the extent to 
which monopolistic practices prevail, we must examine not only the cases where a single enterprise is the 
sole or dominant producer of the goods or services but also the cases where a few enterprises between 
themselves share such dominating position.” 
RESTRICTIVE TRADE PRACTICES  
The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969, has as one of its objects the prohibition of 
restrictive trade practices. In order to ensure that the benefits of free and fair competition in a market reach 
the ultimate consumer, it is essential that the process of competition should not be distorted by any trade 
practice, either by a single manufacturer or a group of manufacturers or dealers. For instance, if a 
manufacturer stipulates a condition that the wholesale purchaser shall sell only his products and not of 
others or shall resell the goods only at the prices stipulated by him or forces the wholesale purchaser to 
procure the entire line of manufacture from him, the result may be a distortion of competition in the market. 
The MRTP Act is concerned with promoting fair and free competition in the market, the securing of consumer 
interest being the ultimate goal. 
The Monopolies Inquiry Commission in its report observed that a restrictive trade practice means a practice 
which obstructs the free play of competitive forces or impedes the free flow of capital or resources into the 
stream of production or of the finished goods in the stream of distribution at any point before they reach the 
hands of the ultimate consumer. The Commision list out the following types of restrictive trade practices 
pursued not only in India but also in many other countries. These include(i) horizontal fixation of price (ii) 
vertical fixation of price and re-sale price maintenance; (iii) allocation of markets between purchasers; (iv) 
discrimination between purchasers; (v) boycott; (vi) exclusive dealing contracts; and (vii) tie-up 
arrangements. 
The Monopolies Inquiry Commission made a wee-bit of distinction between a monopolistic trade practice and 
a restrictive trade practice. It observed every monopolistic trade practice is on the face of it a restrictive trade 
EP-EBCL 
246 
practice. Indeed, sometimes the two words are used indiscriminately. Thus the report of Macquarrie 
Committee which was set up to study Canadian Combines Legislation treats all combines or common policy 
among several firms designed to strengthen the market position of a group of firms as monopolistic 
practices. In our opinion, every practice whether it is by action or understanding or agreement, formal or 
informal, to which persons enjoying monopoly power resort in exercise of the same to reap the benefits of 
that power and every action, understanding or agreement tended to or calculated to preserve, increase or 
consolidate such power should properly be designated as monopolistic trade practice. 
UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES  
Unfair trade practices in trade and commerce were prevalent even in older days. Priests in Sumaria and 
Babylon are on record to have lent money to the needy at high rates of interest. During the period of Tudors, 
practices of forestalling (meaning pushing up prices by buying up supplies before they reached market), 
regrating (buying up supplies in the market), and engrossing (buying up supplies wherever available) were 
prevalent. Thus exploitation at market place is not a new phenomena of modern civilisation. At present 
various types of unfair trade practices are prevalent at National as well as at International markets. The 
legislative history of countries the world over bears redeeming testimony to the endeavours of the National 
Governments to enact suitable legislations to curb such unfair trade practices. 
The underlying objective of such legislative endeavours has been to make the behaviour at market place 
conducive to righteous dealings so that the ultimate consumer gets a fair deal. Senator Murphy, the then 
Australian Attorney General, introducing the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill of the Commonwealth of 
Australia in the Senate said: In consumer transactions, unfair practices are widespread. The existing law is 
still founded on the principle known as ‘Caveat Emptor meaning ‘let the buyer beware. That principle may 
have been appropriate for transactions conducted in village markets, it has ceased to be appropriate as a 
general rule. Now the marketing of goods and services is conducted on organised basis and by the trained 
business executives. The untrained consumer is no match for the businessman who attempts to persuade 
the consumer to buy goods or services on terms and conditions suitable to the vendor. The consumer needs 
protection by the law and this Bill will provide such protection. 
It is often said that consumers need no special protection; all can be safely left to the market. But the concept 
of perfect market is an economists dream and consumers sovereignty a myth. In real life products are 
complex and of great variety and consumers and retailers have imperfect knowledge. Suppliers may often 
have a dominant buying position. As a consequence bargaining power in the market is generally weighed 
against the consumer. Thus consumers have felt the need to create organisations to identify their interests 
and to supply information and advice. 
The Federal Trade Commission of US is stated to have labelled under the Federal Trade Commission Act, 
1914 numerous practices not known before. It was because a need was felt to ensure that the public was 
prevented from being made victims of false claims of products blatantly advertised even though it may not 
have an adverse effect on the competition. The effort was to shift the emphasis on detention and eradication 
of fraud against the consumers, particularly those belonging to the weaker sections of the society. 
Consumer Protection Law in India 
The Government enacted various laws to safeguard the interest of the consumers. The Essential 
Commodities Act, The Trade Marks Act, The Specific Relief Act, The Drugs Control Act, The Drugs and 
Cosmetics Act, The Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, The Emblems and 
Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, The Indian Standard Institution (Certification Marks) Act, The 
Agricultural Produce (Grading and Marketing) Act, The Standards of Weights and Measures Act, etc. are a 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
247 
few of the many laws intended to protect the interest of the consumer. Some of these laws alongwith the 
delegated legislation framed thereunder protect both the pecuniary interest as well as other interests of the 
consumer. Even the Indian Contract Act 1872 and the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 contain provisions for breach 
of contracts and remedies therefor. The Indian Penal Code provides for stringent punishment for certain 
offences. 
In the year 1986, the Government enacted the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and framed necessary rules 
thereunder, for facilitating the formation of Consumer Protection Councils in all states and setting up of 
Consumer Forums at district level, State Commission at state level and National Commission at national 
level for redressing the grievances of consumers. The Government also framed the MRTP (Recognition of 
Consumer Association) Rules and amended a number of economic legislations like the Essential 
Commodities Act, 1955; Standards of Weights and Measures Act, 1976; Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 
1954; Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 etc. to provide better protection to consumers. 
However, the passing of the MRTP Act, 1969, could be said to be the beginning of the Governments concern 
for consumer interest. Till the amendment of the Act in the year 1984, even the MRTP Act did not contain 
provisions directly aimed at protecting the interests of consumer, but they were intended to regulate 
competition in the hope that it would generate fair conduct, the effect of which would percolate to the ultimate 
consumer, the terminal point in the distributive line. 
Recommendations of Sachar Committee 
The Government of India appointed a Committee in August, 1977 under the Chairmanship of Justice 
Rajinder Sachar to look into the simplification of the working of the companies and the MRTP Act. The 
Committee submitted its report in the year 1978 and as far as recommendations pertaining to the MRTP Act 
are concerned, far reaching changes were suggested by the Committee. For the first time, the Committee 
highlighted the need for introduction of suitable provisions to curb unfair trade practices. 
In its view, the assumption that curbing monopolistic and restrictive trade practices and thereby preventing 
distortion of competition automatically results in the consumers getting a fair deal was only partly true. It was felt 
necessary to protect the consumers from practices adopted by trade and industry to mislead or dupe them. 
The Committee pointed out that advertisements and sales promotion having become well established modes 
of modern business techniques, representations through such advertisements to the consumer should not 
become deceptive. If a consumer was falsely induced to enter into buying goods which do not possess the 
quality and did not have the cure for the ailment advertised, it was apparent that the consumer was being 
made to pay for quality of things on false representation. Such a situation could not be accepted. 
Therefore, an obligation is to be cast on the seller to speak the truth when he advertises and also to avoid 
half truths, the purpose being preventing false or misleading advertisements. 
The Committee also noted that fictitious bargain was another common form of deception and many devices 
were used to lure buyers into believing that they were getting something for nothing or at a nominal value for 
their money. The Committee observed: Prices may be advertised as greatly reduced and cut when in reality 
the goods may be sold at sellers regular prices. Advertised statements that could have two meanings, one of 
which is false, are also considered misleading. In America, it was held that statement that a tooth paste fights 
decay could be interpreted as a promise of complete protection and was thus deceptive. Mock-ups on 
television put up by companies including Colgate Palmolive had also received the attention of the 
Enforcement Agencies in America and have been held to be deceptive. 
We cannot say that the type of misleading and deceptive practices which are to be found in other countries 
EP-EBCL 
248 
are not being practised in our country. Unfortunately our Act is totally silent on this aspect. The result is that 
the consumer has no protection against false or deceptive advertisements. Any misrepresentation about the 
quality of a commodity or the potency of a drug or medicine can be projected without much risk. This has 
created a situation of a very safe heaven for the suppliers and a position of frustration and uncertainty for the 
consumers. It should be the function of any consumers legislation to meet this challenge specifically. 
Consumer protection must have a positive and active role. 
Accordingly, the Committee specified certain unfair trade practices which were notorious and suggested 
prohibition of such practices. The main category of unfair trade practices recommended for prohibition by the 
Sachar Committee were: (a) misleading advertisements and false representations (b) bargain sale, bait and 
switch selling; (c) offering gifts or prizes with the intention of not providing them and conducting promotional 
contests; (d) supplying goods not conforming to safety standards; and (e) hoarding and destruction of goods. 
In India, by an amendment to the MRTP Act in the year 1984 Part B Unfair Trade Practices was added to 
Chapter V. It may be recalled that Part A of Chapter V deals with registration of agreements relating to 
restrictive trade practices. Section 36A, 36B, 36C, 36D and 36E are relevant for the purposes of 
understanding the main provisions relating to unfair trade practices. 
Scheme of the Act with respect to Unfair Trade Practices 
The term ‘Unfair Trade Practices’ is defined in Section 36A which enlists a number of practices as unfair 
trade practices. This definition has been amended vide the MRTP (Amendment) Act, 1991 making its scope 
wider in application. Section 36B provides for an enquiry into unfair trade practices by the MRTP 
Commission. Section 36C contains provision for preliminary investigation by the Director General in certain 
cases. Section 36D deals with the powers of the Commission to inquire into unfair trade practice and pass 
remedial orders. Section 36E empowers the Commission to exercise same powers in respect of unfair trade 
practices as it exercises in respect of restrictive trade practices. 
 
Why do we need competition in the market? 
Competition is now universally acknowledged as the best means of ensuring that 
consumers have access to the broadest range of services at the most competitive 
prices. Producers will have maximum incentive to innovate, reduce their costs and 
meet consumer demand. Competition thus promotes allocative and productive 
efficiency. But all this requires healthy market conditions and governments across 
the globe are increasingly trying to remove market imperfections through appropriate 
regulations to promote competition.

DEFINITIONS 
The important concepts incorporated in the Competition Act, 2002 have been defined under Section 2 of the 
Act. These have been discussed herein below: 
Acquisition 
This term has been specifically defined. It means – directly or indirectly, acquiring or agreeing to acquire: (i) 
shares, voting rights or assets of any enterprise; (ii) control over management or control over assets of any 
enterprise. [(Section 2(a)] 
The terms ‘acquiring’ or ‘acquisition’ are relevant for “Regulation of Combinations”. 
Agreement  
The term includes any arrangement or understanding or action in concert 
 
(i) whether or not, such arrangement, understanding or concert is in formal or in writing; or 
 
(ii) whether or not such arrangement, understanding or concert is intended to be enforceable by legal 
proceedings.  
It implies that an arrangement need not necessarily be in writing. The term is relevant in the context of 
Section 3, which envisages that anti-competitive agreements shall be void and thereby prohibited by the law. 
[Section 2(b)] 
The term “Competition” is not defined in the Act. However, in the corporate world, the term is generally 
understood as a process whereby the economic enterprises compete with each other to secure customers 
for their product. In the process, the enterprises compete to outsmart their competitors, sometimes to 
eliminate their rivals. Competition in the sense of economic rivalry is unstable and has a natural tendency to 
give way to a monopoly. Thus, competition kills competition. 
Cartel 
“Cartel” includes an association of producers, sellers or distributors, traders or service providers who, by 
agreement amongst themselves, limit control or attempt to control the production, distribution, sale or price of 
or, trade in goods or provision of services. [Section 2(c)] 
The nature of a cartel is to raise price above competitive levels, resulting in injury to consumers and to the 
economy. For the consumers, cartelisation results in higher prices, poor quality and less or no choice for 
goods or/and services. 
An international cartel is said to exist, when not all of the enterprises in a cartel are based in the same 
country or when the cartel affects markets of more than one country. 
EP-EBCL 
250 
An import cartel comprises enterprises (including an association of enterprises) that get together for the 
purpose of imports into the country. 
An export cartel is made up of enterprises based in one country with an agreement to cartelize markets in 
other countries. In the Competition Act, cartels meant exclusively for exports have been excluded from the 
provisions relating to anti-competitive agreements. This is because such cartels do not adversely affect 
markets in India and are hence outside the purview of the Competition Act. 
If there is effective competition in the market, cartels would find it difficult to be formed and sustained. 
 
Some of the conditions that are conducive to cartelization are: 
 
 
 high concentration - few competitors 
 high entry and exit barriers 
 homogeneity of the products (similar products) 
 similar production costs 
 excess capacity 
 high dependence of the consumers on the product 
 history of collusion 
Chairperson 
Chairperson means the Chairperson of Competition Commission of India appointed under Sub-section (1) of 
Section 8. [Section 2(d)] 
Commission 
Commission means Competition Commission of India established under Section 7(1). [Section 2(e)] 
Consumer 
Under that Act, the Consumer includes only such purchasers or buyers who make purchases for their own 
consumption or to earn their livelihood. This deficiency has now been made good – by defining “Consumer” 
under the Act. Consumer means any person who 
 
(i) buys any goods for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly 
promised, or under any system of deferred payment and includes any user of such goods other than 
the person who buys such goods for consideration paid or promised or under any system of 
deferred payment when such use is made with the approval of such person, whether such purchase 
of goods is for resale or for any commercial purpose or for personal use.  
 
(ii) hires or avails of any services for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid 
and partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment when such services are availed of 
with the approval of the first mentioned person whether such hiring or availing of services is for any 
commercial purpose or for personal use. [Section 2(f)] 
It may be noted that under the Competition Act even if a person purchases goods or avails of services for 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
251 
commercial purpose, he will be a Consumer, whereas for purposes of Consumer Protection Act, a person 
purchasing goods/availing services for commercial purposes is not a “Consumer” and can not seek relief 
under that Act.  
Director General 
Director General means the Director General appointed under Section 16(1) and includes Additional, Joint or 
Deputy or Assistant Director Generals. [Section 2(g)] 
Enterprise 
Enterprise means a person or a department of the Government, who or which is, engaged in any activity, 
relating to production, control of goods or articles or provision of services, of any kind, or in investment, or in 
the business of acquiring, holding, underwriting or dealing with shares, debentures or other securities 
whether such unit or division or subsidiary is located at the same place where the enterprise is located or at 
different place(s). 
However, it does not include any activity of the Central Government relating to sovereign functions of 
Government including all activities carried on by the Government Departments dealing with atomic energy, 
currency, defence and space.  
‘Activity’ includes profession or occupation. ‘A unit or division’ includes a plant or factory established for 
production, supply, distribution, acquisition or control of any goods or any branch or office established for 
provision of any service. [Section 2(h)] 
It may thus be noted that sovereign function of Government are excluded from definition of enterprise but 
Government Departments performing non-sovereign functions for consideration are subject to jurisdiction of 
Commission. 
Goods 
Goods means goods as defined in Sale of Goods Act, 1930 and includes 
 
(a) products manufactured, processed or mined;  
 
(b)  debentures, shares and stocks after allotment;  
 
(c) in relation to ‘goods supplied’, goods imported into India. [Section 2(i)] 
Member 
Member means a Member of the Commission appointed under Section 8(1) of the Act and includes a 
Chairperson. [Section 2(j)] 
Notification 
Notification means notification published in the Official Gazette. [Section 2(k)] 
Person 
Person includes (i) an individual; (ii) a Hindu undivided family; (iii) a company; (iv) a firm; (v) an association 
of persons; (vi) a corporation established under Central, State Act or a Government Company (vii) a body 
corporate incorporated by or under a law of a foreign country; (viii) a co-operative society registered under 
any Law (ix) local authority (x) every artificial juridical person. 
‘Government Company’ for this Section will be same as defined under Section 617 of Companies Act, 1956. 
[Section 2(p)] 
EP-EBCL 
252 
Practice 
Practice includes any practice relating to carrying on of any trade by a person or enterprise. [Section 2(p)] 
Prescribed 
Prescribed means prescribed by rules made under the Act by Central Government. [Section 2(n)] 
Price 
Price, in relation to sale of goods or supply of services, includes every valuable consideration, whether direct 
or indirect, or deferred, and includes any consideration, which relates to sale of any goods or to performance 
of any services although ostensibly relating to any other matter or thing. [Section 2(o)] 
Public Financial Institution 
Public Financial Institution means a Public Financial Institution as defined in Section 4A of Companies Act, 
1956 and includes a State Financial, Industrial or Investment corporation. [Section 2(p)] 
Regulations 
Regulations means the regulations made by the Competition Commission of India. [Section 2(q)] 
Relevant Market 
Relevant market means the market, which may be determined by the Commission with reference to ‘relevant 
product market’ or ‘relevant geographic market’ or with reference to both the markets. [Section 2(r)] 
Relevant Geographic Market 
Relevant Geographic Market means a market comprising the area in which the conditions of competition for 
supply of goods or provision of services or demand of goods or services are distinctly homogenous and can 
be distinguished from conditions prevailing in neighbouring areas. [Section 2(s)] 
Relevant Product Market 
Relevant Product Market means a market comprising of all those products or services which are regarded as 
interchangeable or substitutable by the consumer, by reasons of characteristics of products or services, their 
prices and intended use. [Section 2(t)] 
The terms ‘relevant market’, ‘relevant geographical market’ and ‘relevant product market’ have relevance in 
determination of the agreements being anti competitive, in evaluating combinations and dominance of an 
enterprise or group. An agreement in the nature of cartel which limits or controls production, supply, market, 
technical development, investments etc. need to be looked as being anti competitive with reference to 
relevant market. Similarly agreement to share the market or sources of production by way of allocation of 
geographical area of market, types of goods or services or number of customers in the market or by any 
similar way and these need to be interpreted in the context of the definition of relevant geographical market 
under Section 2(s). 
Service 
Service means service of any description which is made available to potential users and includes the 
provision of services in connection with business of any industrial or commercial matters such as banking, 
communication, education, financing, insurance, chit funds, real estate, transport, storage, material 
treatment, processing, supply of electrical or other energy, boarding, lodging, entertainment, amusement, 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
253 
construction, repair, conveying of news or information and advertising.  [Section 2(u)] 
It may be noted that under the Competition Act, the services of industrial or commercial nature also fall within 
the scope of the Act whereas under the Consumer Protection Act, the services of commercial nature or for 
business or industrial purposes are excluded for interpreting deficiency in the supply thereof and for 
determining compensation, if any, payable to them. To this extent, the relief claimable under the Consumer 
Protection Act, 1986 is limited in scope. It may also be noted that “education” has been specifically included 
in ambit of “Service” to set at rest the dispute, if any, about the jurisdiction of Commission in such matters. 
Shares 
Shares means shares in the share capital of a company carrying voting rights and includes, –  
 
(i) any security which entitles the holder to receive shares with voting rights;  
 
(ii) stock except where a distinction between stock and share is expressed or implied. [Section 2(v)] 
This definition of shares is much wider than what is provided under the Companies Act. It implies that not 
only shares in the share capital of a company e.g. equity or preference shares are included in the definition 
of shares but ‘debentures convertible into shares with voting rights’ are also included. 
Statutory Authority 
Statutory authority means any authority, board, corporation, council, institute, university or any other body 
corporate, established by or under any Central, State or Provincial Act for the purposes of regulating 
production or supply of goods or provision of any services or markets therefor or any matter connected 
therewith or incidental thereto.  [Section 2(w)] 
It implies that this definition widens the scope of type of bodies, which are empowered to make a reference 
for enquiring into anti-competitive agreement or abuse of dominant position or make a reference for opinion 
on a competition issue. 
Trade 
Trade means any ‘trade’, business, industry, profession or occupation relating to production, supplies, 
distribution, storage or control of goods and includes the provision of any services. 
The definition of the term ‘trade’ is relevant, inter-alia, to the interpretation of any of the type of agreement listed 
in Section 4 (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) in relation to the trading goods and provisions of services.  [Section 2(x)] 
Turnover 
Turnover includes value of sale of goods or services. [Section 2(y)] 
The definition of the term ’turnover’, inter-alia, is relevant and significant in determining whether the 
combination of merging entities exceeds the threshold limit of the turnover specified in Section 5 of the Act. It 
is also relevant for the purpose of imposition of fines by the Commission. 
Section 2 further provides that the words and expression used but not defined in the Competition Act, 2002 
and defined in the Companies Act, 1956 [(1) of 1956] shall have the same meaning respectively assigned to 
them in the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956). 
Chapter II of the Competition Act, 2002 stipulates provisions relating to Prohibition of Certain Agreements, 
Abuse of Dominant Position and Regulations of Combinations. 
Anti Competitive Agreements 
It is provided under Section 3(1) of the Competition Act that no enterprise or association of enterprises or 
EP-EBCL 
254 
person or association of persons shall enter into any agreement in respect of production, supply, 
distribution, storage, acquisition or control of goods or provision of services, which causes or is likely to 
cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition. Section 3(2) further declares that any anti competitive 
agreement within the meaning of sub-section 3(1) shall be void. Under the law, the whole agreement is 
construed as ‘void’ if it contains anti-competitive clauses having appreciable adverse effect on competition.  
Section 3(3) provides that following kinds of agreements entered into between enterprises or association 
of enterprises or persons or associations of persons or person or enterprise or practice carried on, or 
decision taken by any association of enterprises or association of persons, including “cartels”, engaged in 
identical or similar goods or services which –  
 
(a) directly or indirectly determines purchase or sale prices;  
 
(b) limits or controls production, supply, markets, technical development, investment or provision of 
services;  
 
(c) shares the market or source of production or provision of services by way of allocation of 
geographical area of market, or type of goods or services, or number of customers in the market or 
any other similar way; and  
 
(d) directly or indirectly results in bid rigging or collusive bidding; 
shall be presumed to have an appreciable adverse effect on the competition and onus to prove otherwise lies 
on the defendant. 
The explanation appended to the Section 3 defines the term ‘bid rigging’ as any agreement between 
enterprises or persons which has the effect of eliminating or reducing competition for bids or adversely 
affecting or manipulating the process for bidding. Efficiency enhancing joint ventures entered into by parties 
engaged in identical or similar goods or services, shall not be presumed to have appreciable adverse effect 
on competition but judged by rule of reason. The term “cartel” used in the Section is the most severe form of 
entering into ‘anti competitive agreements’ and has been defined in Section 2(c). 
Bid rigging takes place when bidders collude and keep the bid amount at a pre-determined level. Such pre-
determination is by way of intentional manipulation by the members of the bidding group. Bidders could be 
actual or potential ones, but they collude and act in concert. 
Bid rigging is anti-competitive 
Bidding, as a practice, is intended to enable the procurement of goods or services on the most favourable 
terms and conditions. Invitation of bids is resorted to both by Government (and Government entities) and 
private bodies (companies, corporations, etc.). But the objective of securing the most favourable prices and 
conditions may be negated if the prospective bidders collude or act in concert. Such collusive bidding or bid 
rigging contravenes the very purpose of inviting tenders and is inherently anti-competitive. 
 
Some of the most commonly adopted ways in which collusive bidding or bid rigging may occur are: 
 
• agreements to submit identical bids 
• agreements as to who shall submit the lowest bid, agreements for the submission of cover bids 
(voluntarily inflated bids) 
• agreements not to bid against each other, 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
255 
• agreements on common norms to calculate prices or terms of bids 
• agreements to squeeze out outside bidders 
• agreements designating bid winners in advance on a rotational basis, or on a geographical or 
customer allocation basis 
If bid rigging takes place in Government tenders, it is likely to have severe adverse effects on its purchases 
and on public spending. Bid rigging or collusive bidding is treated with severity in the law. The presumptive 
approach reflects the severe treatment. 
Section 3(4) provides that any agreement amongst enterprises or persons at different stages or levels of the 
production chain in different markets, in respect of production, supply, distribution, storage, sale or price of, 
or trade in goods or provision of services, including  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
shall be an agreement in contravention of sub-section (1) if such agreement causes or is likely to cause an 
appreciable adverse effect on competition in India. 
The term “tie-in agreement” includes any agreement requiring a purchaser of goods, as a condition of such 
purchase, to purchase some other goods. A good example of tie-in agreement is where a gas distributor 
requires a consumer to buy a gas stove as a pre condition to obtain connection of domestic cooking gas. 
[Chanakaya and Siddharth Gas company, In-re RTP 11/1985 decided by (MRTP Commission on 27.1.1985)] 
“Exclusive supply agreement” includes any agreement restricting in any manner from acquiring or 
otherwise dealing in any goods other than those of the seller or any other person. Thus, where a 
manufacturer asks a dealer not to deal in similar products of its competitor directly or indirectly and 
discontinues the supply on the ground that dealer also deals in product of suppliers’ competitor’s goods is an 
illustration of exclusive dealing agreement. [Bhartia Curtec Hammer Ltd. In-re (1997) 24 CLA 104 (MRTPC)]  
“Exclusive distribution agreement” includes any agreement to limit, restrict or withhold the output or 
supply of any goods or allocate any area or market for the disposal or sale of the goods. 
Requiring a distributor not to sell the goods of the manufacturer beyond the prescribed territory is a good

example of exclusive distribution agreement. Vadilal Enterprise Ltd. In-re (1998 (91) COMP CAS 824 is a 
good example of exclusive distribution agreement.  
“Refusal to deal” includes any agreement, which restricts, or is likely to restrict, by any method the persons 
or classes of persons to whom goods are sold or from whom goods are bought. For eg. an agreement which 
provides that the franchisees will not deal in products or goods of similar nature for a period of three years 
from the date of determination of agreement within a radius of five kms from showroom amounts to exclusive 
dealing agreement. DGIR v. Titan industries (2001) 43 CLA 293 MRTPC. 
“Resale price maintenance” includes any agreement to sell goods on condition that the prices to be 
charged on resale by the purchaser shall be the prices stipulated by the seller unless it is clearly stated that 
prices lower than those prices may be charged. 
Any stipulation that the cement dealer should not sell below the stipulated price is a ‘resale price 
maintenance’ practice and is an anti competitive practice. (In re-India Cement Ltd. RTP Inquiry 48 /1985). 
The agreements falling in Section 3(3) shall be presumed to have appreciable adverse affect on competition 
and thereby they are construed as deemed restrictive agreements. The agreements falling in Section 3(4) 
shall be judged by rule of reason and the onus lies on the prosecutor to prove its appreciable adverse effect 
on competition. The definition of all restrictive concepts covered under Section 3(4) is inclusive one. 
Moreover, Section 3 does not restrict the right of any person to restrain any infringement of or to impose 
reasonable conditions, as may be necessary for protecting any of his rights which have been or may be 
conferred upon him under 
 
(a) the Copyright Act, 1957; 
 
(b) the Patents Act, 1970; 
 
(c) the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 or the Trade Marks Act, 1999; 
 
(d) the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999; 
 
(e) the Designs Act, 2000; 
 
(f) the Semi-conductor Integrated Circuits Layout-Design Act, 2000.  
That apart, the Act does not restrict any person’s right to export from India goods under an agreement which 
requires him to exclusively supply, distribute or control goods or provision of services for fulfilling export 
contracts. The exclusion of ‘export business’ is in view of ‘effect theory’, and doctrine of ‘relevant market’. 
 
WHAT IS AN ANTI-COMPETITIVE AGREEMENT? 
An anti-competitive agreement is an agreement having appreciable adverse effect on 
competition. Anti-competitive agreements include, but are not limited to:- 
• agreement to limit production and/or supply; 
• agreement to allocate markets; 
• agreement to fix price; 
• bid rigging or collusive bidding; 
• conditional purchase/ sale (tie-in arrangement); 
• exclusive supply / distribution arrangement; 
• resale price maintenance; and 
• refusal to deal. 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
257 
Prohibition of abuse of dominant position 
Section 4 of the Competition Act, 2002 expressly prohibits any enterprise or group from abusing its dominant 
position, meaning thereby a position of strength, enjoyed by an enterprise or group, in the relevant market, in 
India, which enables it to– 
 
(i) operate independently of competitive forces prevailing in the relevant market; or 
 
(ii) affect its competitors or consumers or the relevant market in its favour”.  
In line with the latest global trend, the dominance shall not be determined with reference to “assets”, 
“turnover” or “market share”. 
As per Section 2(r) ‘relevant market’ means the market, which may be determined by the Commission with 
reference to the relevant ‘product market’ or ‘relevant geographic market’ or with reference to both the 
markets. Thus, for determining dominance, these are relevant concepts.  
The term “enterprise” means a person or a department of the Government, who or which is, or has been, 
engaged in any activity, relating to the production, storage, supply, distribution, acquisition or control of 
articles or goods, or the provision of services, of any kind, or in investment, or in the business of acquiring, 
holding, underwriting or dealing with shares, debentures or other securities of any other body corporate, 
either directly or through one or more of its units or divisions or subsidiaries, whether such unit or division or 
subsidiary is located at the same place where the enterprise is located or at a different place or at different 
places, but does not include any activity of the Government relatable to the sovereign functions of the 
Government including all activities carried on by the departments of the Central Government dealing with 
atomic energy, currency, defence and space. 
For the purposes of this clause, “activity” includes profession or occupation; “article” includes a new article 
and “service” includes a new service; “unit” or “division”, in relation to an enterprise, includes— 
 
(i) a plant or factory established for the production, storage, supply, distribution, acquisition or control 
of any article or goods; 
 
(ii) any branch or office established for the provision of any service. 
Section 4(2) states that there shall be abuse of dominant position, if an enterprise or group  
 
(a) directly or indirectly imposes unfair or discriminatory; 
 
(i) condition in purchase or sale of goods or services; or  
 
(ii) price in purchase or sale (including predatory price) of goods or service.  
Explanation appended to Section 4 (2) clarifies that the unfair or discriminatory condition in purchase or sale 
of goods or services shall not include any discriminatory condition or price which may be adopted to meet the 
competition. 
Section 4(2)(b) includes in abuse of dominant position an enterprise or group limiting or restricting 
 
(i) production of goods or provision of services or market therefore; or 
 
(ii) technical or scientific development relating to goods or services to the prejudice of consumers.  
Similarly Section 4 (2) (c), (d) and (e) specify three other forms of abuses namely, if any person indulges in 
practice or practices resulting in denial of market access in any manner; or makes conclusion of contracts 
EP-EBCL 
258 
subject to acceptance by other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to 
commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts and also, if any person uses 
dominant position in one relevant market to enter into, or protect, other relevant market. 
The term “predatory price” has been defined as the sale of goods or provision of services, at a price which is 
below the cost, as may be determined by regulations, of production of goods or provision of services, with a 
view to reduce competition or eliminate the competitors. Thus, the two conditions precedent to bring a case 
with the ambit of predatory pricing are: 
 
(i) selling goods or provision of service at a price which is below its cost of production and  
 
(ii) that practice is resorted to eliminate the competitors or to reduce competition. 
The Competition Commission of India has been empowered under Section 19(4) of the Act to determine 
whether any enterprise or group enjoys a dominant position or not, in the ‘relevant market’ and also to decide 
whether or not there has been an abuse of dominant position. It may be noted that mere existence of 
dominance is not to be frowned upon unless the dominance is abused. 
 
WHAT CONSTITUTES ABUSE OF DOMINANCE? 
Dominance refers to a position of strength which enables an enterprise to operate 
independently of competitive forces or to affect its competitors or consumers or the 
market in its favour. Abuse of dominant position impedes fair competition between 
firms, exploits consumers and makes it difficult for the other players to compete with 
the dominant undertaking on merit. Abuse of dominant position includes: 
• imposing unfair conditions or price, 
• predatory pricing, 
• limiting production/market or technical development , 
• creating barriers to entry, 
• applying dissimilar conditions to similar transactions, 
• denying market access, and 
• using dominant position in one market to gain advantages in another market. 
Combinations 
Combination has broad coverage and includes acquisition of control, shares, voting rights, assets, merger or 
amalgamation.  
 
WHAT IS COMBINATION? 
Broadly, combination under the Act means acquisition of control, shares, voting rights 
or assets, acquisition of control by a person over an enterprise where such person 
has direct or indirect control over another enterprise engaged in competing 
businesses, and mergers and amalgamations between or amongst enterprises when 
the combining parties exceed the thresholds set in the Act. The thresholds are 
specified in the Act in terms of assets or turnover in India and outside India. Entering 
into a combination which causes or is likely to cause an appreciable adverse effect 
on competition within the relevant market in India is prohibited and such combination shall be void. 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
259 
Threshold of Combination specified under section 5 of the Act in tabular form given below: 
On March 4, 2016, the Central Government issued notifications pertaining to the statutory thresholds for the 
purposes of “combinations” under Section 5 of the Competition Act, 2002(“Act”). 
 
1. Increase in thresholds: Pursuant to Notification No. S.O. 675(E) dated March 4, 2016, the value of 
assets and the value of turnover has been enhanced by 100% for the purposes of Section 5 of the 
Act. Accordingly, the revised thresholds for notification to the Competition Commission of India 
(“Commission”) are:

1. Increase in thresholds of De Minimis Exemption: Pursuant to Notification No. S.O. 674 (E)dated 
March 4, 2016, acquisitions where enterprises whose control, shares, voting rights or assets are 
being acquired have assets of not more than Rs. 350 crore in India or turnover of not more than Rs. 
1000 crore in India, are exempt from Section 5 of the Act for a period of 5 years. Accordingly, the 
revised threshold for availing of the De Minimis exemption for acquisitions are:

1. Definition of Group: As per Notification No. S.O. 673 (E) dated March 4, 2016, the exemption to 
the “group” exercising less than fifty per cent of voting rights in other enterprise from the provisions 
of Section 5 of the Act under Notification No. S.O. 481 (E) dated March4, 2011, has been continued 
for a further period of 5 years. 
Regulation of Combinations 
Section 6 of the Competition Act prohibits any person or enterprise from entering into a combination which 
causes or is likely to cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition within the relevant market in India 
EP-EBCL 
260 
and if such a combination is formed, it shall be void. Section 6(2) envisages that any person or enterprise, 
who or which proposes to enter into any combination, shall give a notice to the Commission disclosing 
details of the proposed combination, in the form, prescribed and submit the form together with the fee 
prescribed by regulations. Such intimation should be submitted within 30 days of 
 
(a) approval of the proposal relating to merger or amalgamation, referred to in Section 5(c), by the board 
of directors of the enterprise concerned with such merger or amalgamation, as the case may be; 
 
(b) execution of any agreement or other document for acquisition referred to in Section 5(a) or 
acquiring of control referred to in Section 5(b).  
A newly inserted sub-section (2A) envisages that no combination shall come into effect until 210 days have 
passed from the day of notice or the Commission has passed orders, whichever is earlier. 
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has been empowered to deal with such notice in accordance 
with provisions of Sections 29, 30 and 31 of the Act. Section 29 prescribes procedure for investigation of 
combinations. Section 30 empowers the Commission to determine whether the disclosure made to it under 
Section 6(2) is correct and whether the combination has, or is likely to have, an appreciable adverse effect 
on the competition. Section 31 provides that the Commission may allow the combination if it will not have any 
appreciable adverse effect on competition or pass an order that the combination shall not take effect, if in its 
opinion, such a combination has or is likely to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition. 
The provisions of Section 6 do not apply to share subscription or financing facility or any acquisition, by a 
public financial institution, foreign institutional investor, bank or venture capital fund, pursuant to any 
covenant of a loan agreement or investment agreement. This exemption appears to have been provided in 
the Act to facilitate raising of funds by an enterprise in the course of its normal business. Under Section 6(5), 
the public financial institution, foreign institutional investor, bank or venture capital fund, are required to file in 
prescribed form, details of the control, the circumstances for exercise of such control and the consequences 
of default arising out of loan agreement or investment agreement, within seven days from the date of such 
acquisition or entering into such agreement, as the case may be. 
As per the explanation appended to Section 6(5) 
 
(a) “foreign institutional investor” has the same meaning as assigned to it in clause (a) of the 
Explanation to Section 115AD of the Income-tax Act, 1961; 
 
(b) “venture capital fund” has the same meaning as assigned to it in clause (b) of the Explanation to 
clause (23 FB) of Section 10 of the Income-tax Act, 1961.  
It may be noted that under the law, the combinations are only regulated whereas anti-competitive 
agreements and abuse of dominance are prohibited. Further, under the MRTP Act prior to 27.9.91, 
undertakings of certain size were required to be registered and such undertakings were required to seek 
prior approval of the Central Government before embarking upon expansion plans. In the present Act, there 
is no requirement of registration of an undertaking and further, there is no need to have prior approval of the 
Central Government but CCI will only examine as to whether or not combination is or is likely to have an 
appreciable adverse effect on competition.  
The Competition Act with many innovative concepts coupled with power to impose fine is likely to let in harsh 
glare of sunlight to disinfect pernicious anti-competitive practices. 
Competition Commission of India 
 
Establishment of Commission 
The Central Government under Section 7 has been empowered to establish a Commission to be called 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
261 
“Competition Commission of India” by issue of a Notification. The Commission is a body corporate having 
perpetual succession and a common seal. The Commission has power to acquire, hold movable or 
immovable property and to enter into contract in its name and by the said name, sue or be sued. In the 
premises, the set up of Commission corresponds to that of Securities & Exchange Board of India constituted 
under the SEBI Act, 1992. 
The Head Office of the Commission shall be at such place as the Central Government may decide from time 
to time. Vide Notification: SO 1198(E) dated 14th Oct., 2003, the Central Government established the 
Competition Commission of India having its Head Office at New Delhi. 
The Commission has also been authorized to establish its office at other places in India. Thus, the law 
provides for setting up of CCI’s offices at places other than that of its Headquarter. 
Composition of Commission 
The composition of the Commission as spelled out under Section 8 of the Act consists of a Chairperson and not 
less than two and not more than six other Members. The Chairperson and the Members are to be appointed by 
the Central Government. Regarding the qualifications of the Chairman and other Members, Section 8(2) 
provides that they shall be person of ability, integrity and standing and who has special knowledge of and such 
professional experience of not less than fifteen years in international trade, economics, business, commerce, 
law, finance, accountancy, management, industry, public affairs or competition matters including competition 
law and policy which in the opinion of the Central Government, may be useful to the Commission. The 
Chairperson and other Members are to be appointed on whole time basis. 
Selection of Chairperson and Members of Commission 
Section 9(1) envisages that the Chairperson and other Members of the Commission shall be appointed by 
the Central Government from a panel of names recommended by a Selection Committee consisting of the 
Chief Justice of India or his nominee, as Chairperson; and the Secretary in the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, 
Member; the Secretary in the Ministry of Law and Justice, Member; and two experts of repute who have 
special knowledge of, and professional experience in international trade, economics, business, commerce,

Term of office of Chairperson and other Members 
The Act stipulates that the Chairperson and every other Member shall hold office as such for a term of 
five years from the date on which he enters upon his office and shall be eligible for re-appointment. 
However, the Chairperson or other Members shall not hold office as such after he has attained the age 
of sixty-five years. 
A vacancy caused by the resignation or removal of the Chairperson or any other Member under section 11 or 
by death or otherwise shall be filled by fresh appointment in accordance with the provisions of sections 8 and 
9. The Chairperson and every other Member shall, before entering upon his office, make and subscribe to an 
oath of office and of secrecy in such form, manner and before such authority, as may be prescribed. 
In the event of the occurrence of a vacancy in the office of the Chairperson by reason of his death, 
resignation or otherwise, the senior-most Member shall act as the Chairperson, until the date on which a new 
Chairperson, appointed in accordance with the provisions of this Act to fill such vacancy, enters upon his 
office. When the Chairperson is unable to discharge his functions owing to absence, illness or any other 
cause, the senior-most Member shall discharge the functions of the Chairperson until the date on which the 
Chairperson resumes the charge of his functions. 
EP-EBCL 
262 
Resignation of Chairperson etc. 
It has been provided under section 11 that the Chairperson or any other Member may resign his office by 
notice in writing under his hand addressed to the Central Government. However, until the Chairperson or a 
Member is permitted by the Central Government to relinquish his office, he will continue to hold his office 
until the expiry of three months from the date of receipt of such notice or until a person duly appointed as a 
successor enters into his office or until the expiry of his term, which ever is the earliest. Under Section 11(2), 
it is provided that in the following circumstances the Central Government may, by order, remove the 
Chairperson or any Member from his office if such Chairman or Member as the case may be, - 
 
(a) is, or at any time has been, adjudged as an insolvent; or 
 
(b) has engaged at any time, during his term of office, in any paid employment; or  
 
(c) has been convicted of an offence which, in the opinion of the Central Government, involves moral 
turpitude; or 
 
(d) has acquired such financial or other interest as it likely to affect prejudicially his functions as a 
Member; or 
 
(e) has so abused his position as to render his continuance in office prejudicial to the public interest; or 
 
(f) has become physically or mentally incapable of acting as a Member. 
However, no Member shall be removed from his office on the ground that he has acquired such financial or 
other interest as is likely to affect prejudicially his function as a Member or has so abused his position as to 
render his continuance in public office prejudicial to the public interest unless the Supreme Court, on a 
reference being made to it in this behalf by the Central Government, has on an inquiry as prescribed 
reported that the Member ought on such ground or grounds to be removed. 
Section 12 provides that for a period of two years from the date on which the Chairperson and other Member 
cease to hold office shall not accept any appointment in or connected with the management or administration 
of, any enterprise which has been a party to the proceeding before the Commission. This restriction, 
however, shall not apply to any employment under the Central Government or a State Government or local 
authority or any corporation established by or under any Central, State or Provincial Act or a Government 
company as defined in Section 617 of the Companies Act, 1956 (10 of 1956). 
Financial and Administrative Powers of Member Administration 
A Member of the Commission as per Section 13 may be designated by the Central Government as Member 
Administration who shall exercise such financial and administrative powers as may be vested in him under 
the rules made by the Central Government. However, the Member Administration shall have authority to 
delegate such of his financial and administrative powers to any other officer of the Commission as he may 
deem fit subject to the condition that, while exercising delegated powers such official shall continue to act 
under the direction, superintendence and control of the Member Administration. 
Salary and Terms and Conditions of Service 
The salary allowances and other terms and conditions of service of the Chairman and other member including 
travel expenses, house rent allowance, conveyance facility, sumptuary allowance and medical facilities shall be 
such as may be prescribed. Further, to ensure freedom in the functioning of the Chairperson and the Member, 
Section 14(2) provides that the salary allowance and other terms and conditions of service of the Chairperson 
or Member shall not be varied to his disadvantage after his appointment. 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
263 
No act or proceedings of the Commission shall be invalid merely because there is any vacancy in the 
Commission or defect in the constitution of the Commission; or any defect in the appointment of Chairperson 
or a Member; or any irregularity in the procedure of the Commission not affecting the merits of the case. 
Appointment of Director General 
Director General is an important functionary under the Act. He is to assist the Commission in conducting 
inquiry into contravention of any of the provisions of the Act and for performing such other functions as are, 
or may be, provided by or under the Act. 
Section 16 (1) empowers the Central Government to appoint a Director General and such number of 
additional, joint, deputy or assistant Director Generals or other advisers, consultants or officers for the 
purposes of assisting the Commission in conducting inquiry into the contravention of any provision of the Act.  
Additional, joint, deputy and assistant Director Generals, other advisors, consultants and officers shall 
however, exercise powers and discharge functions subject to the general control, supervision and directions 
of the Director General. 
The salary, allowances and other terms and conditions and service of Director General, consultants, advisors 
or other officers assisting him shall be such as may be prescribed by the Central Government. The Director 
General, advisers, consultants and officers assisting him are to be appointed from amongst the persons of 
integrity and outstanding ability and who have experience in investigation, and knowledge of accountancy, 
management, business, public administration, international trade, law or economics and such other 
qualifications as may be prescribed.  
The Commission may appoint a Secretary and such officers and other employees, as it considers necessary 
for the efficient performance of his functions under the Act. The Commission may engage, in accordance 
with the procedure specified by regulations, such number of experts and professionals of integrity and 
outstanding ability, who have special knowledge of, and experience in, economics, law, business or such 
other disciplines related to competition, as it deems necessary to assist the Commission in the discharge of 
its functions under the Act. 
Duties, Powers and Functions of Commission 
As per Section 18 of the Act, duties of the CCI are: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EP-EBCL 
264 
Section 18 empowers the Commission to enter into any memorandum or arrangement, with the prior 
approval of the Central Government, for the purpose of discharging the duties and functions under this Act 
with any agency of any foreign country. This will enable the CCI to have extra territorial reach and shall 
facilitate exchange of information and enforcement of its order. 
Inquiry into certain agreements and dominant position of enterprise 
The Commission may inquire into any alleged contravention of Section 3(1) or 4(1) on its own motion or on  
 
(a) receipt of any information in such manner and accompanied by such fee, from any person, 
consumer or consumer association or trade association; or  
 
(b) a reference made to it by the Central Government or State Government or a statutory authority. 
The Director General is not vested with a right to move an application for institution of an enquiry relating to 
anti-competitive agreements or abuse of dominance. 
The terms ‘person’ and ‘statutory authority’ have been defined under Sections 2(l) and 2(w) respectively. The 
term ‘person’ has been given wide connotation and it includes an individual, a HUF, a company, a firm, an 
association of persons, any corporation established under any Central, State or Provincial Act or a 
Government company, a co-operative society, a local authority and every artificial juridical person.  
 
Section 19(3) provides that while determining whether an agreement has appreciable adverse effect on 
competition, the Commission shall give due regard to all or any of the following factors, namely– 
 
 
 
 
 
(a) creation of barriers to new entrants in the market; 
 
(b) driving existing competitors out of the market; 
 
(c) foreclosure of competition by hindering entry into the market; 
 
(d) accrual of benefits to consumers; 
 
(e) improvements in production or distribution of goods or provision of services; 
 
(f) promotion of technical, scientific and economic development by means of production or 
distribution of goods or provision of services. 
The first three factors are anti-competitive, while the latter three factors deal with benign effects. 
“Adverse appreciable affect on competition” is a key factor while enquiring into anti-competitive agreement. 
The touch stone of appreciable adverse effect on competition need not be proved while enquiring into abuse 
of dominance. 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
265 
For the purpose of determining whether an enterprise enjoys dominant position or not under Section 4, the 
Commission shall have due regard to all or any of the following factors, namely – 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a) market share of the enterprise; 
 
(b) size and resources of the enterprise; 
 
(c) size and importance of the competitors; 
 
(d) economic power of the enterprise including commercial advantages over competitors; 
 
(e) vertical integration of the enterprises or sale or service network of such enterprises; 
 
(f) dependence of consumers on the enterprise; 
 
(g) monopoly or dominant position whether acquired as a result of any statute or by virtue of being a 
Government company or a public sector undertaking or otherwise; 
 
(h) entry barriers including barriers such as regulatory barriers, financial risk, high capital cost of 
entry, marketing entry barriers, technical entry barriers, economies of scale, high cost of 
substitutable goods or service for consumers; 
 
(i) countervailing buying power; 
 
(j) market structure and size of market; 
 
(k) social obligations and social costs; 
 
(l) relative advantage, by way of the contribution to the economic development, by the enterprise 
enjoying a dominant position having or likely to have an appreciable adverse effect on 
competition; 
 (m) any other factor which the Commission may consider relevant for the inquiry. 
The present law makes explicit the issues and the parameters which will be considered while deciding 
“abuse of dominance”. The Commission shall have due regard to the, “relevant geographic market” and 
“relevant product market” for determining as to what constitutes a “relevant market”. 
The terms ‘relevant market’ and “relevant geographic market” have been defined in Sections 2 (r) and 2(s) of 
the Act. For determining the “relevant geographic market”, the Commission shall have due regard to 
all or any of the following factors, namely;─ 
 
(a) regulatory trade barriers; 
 
(b) local specification requirements; 
 
(c) national procurement policies; 
EP-EBCL 
266 
 
(d) adequate distribution facilities; 
 
(e) transport costs; 
 
(f) language; 
 
(g) consumer preferences; 
 
(h) need for secure, regular supplies or rapid after-sales service. 
Similarly, while determining ‘relevant product market’ the Commission shall have due regard to all or any of 
the following factors namely;  
 
(a) physical characteristics or end-use of goods; 
 
(b) price of goods or service; 
 
(c) consumer preferences; 
 
(d) exclusion of in-house production; 
 
(e) existence of specialized producers; 
 
(f) classification of industrial products. 
The prescription of parameters for determining “appreciable adverse effect” on competition of agreement, 
“dominant position”, within “relevant market”, are intended to bring consistency and certainty in the working 
of the Commission which has to consider all or any of the applicable factors, as the case may be. It is quite 
apparent that any inquiry by the CCI will be a detailed exercise, which will not only involve gathering of 
information in regard to technological or marketing factors but also the government policy which relate to the 
trade or business in which the enterprise is involved beside global scenario especially with regard to 
regulatory trade barriers including import-export policy, tariff and subsidy issues will also be taken into 
account by the Commission. 
Inquiry into Combination by Commission 
The Commission under Section 20 of the Competition Act may inquire into the appreciable adverse 
effect caused or likely to be caused on competition in India as a result of combination either upon its 
own knowledge or information (suo motu) or upon receipt of notice under Section 6(2) relating to 
acquisition referred to in Section 5(a) or acquiring of control referred to in Section 5(b) or merger or 
amalgamation referred to in Section 5(c) of the Act. It has also been provided that an enquiry shall be 
initiated by the Commission within one year from the date on which such combination has taken effect. 
Thus, the law has provided a time limit within which suo moto inquiry into combinations can be initiated. 
This provision dispels the fear of enquiry into combination between merging entities after the expiry of 
stipulated period. 
On receipt of the notice under Section 6(2) from the person or an enterprise which proposes to enter into a 
combination, it is mandatory for the Commission to inquire whether the combination referred to in that notice, 
has caused or is likely to cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition in India. 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
267 
The Commission shall have due regard to all or any of the factors for the purposes of determining whether 
the combination would have the effect of or is likely to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition in 
the relevant market, namely 
 
 
 
(a) actual and potential level of competition through imports in the market; 
 
(b) extent of barriers to entry into the market; 
 
(c) level of combination in the market; 
 
(d) degree of countervailing power in the market; 
 
(e) likelihood that the combination would result in the parties to the combination being able to 
significantly and sustainably increase prices or profit margins; 
 
(f) extent of effective competition likely to sustain in a market; 
 
(g) extent to which substitutes are available or are likely to be available in the market; 
 
(h) market share, in the relevant market, of the persons or enterprise in a combination, individually 
and as a combination; 
 
(i) likelihood that the combination would result in the removal of a vigorous and effective competitor 
or competitors in the market; 
 
(j) nature and extent of vertical integration in the market; 
 
(k) possibility of a failing business; 
 
(l) nature and extent of innovation; 
 (m) relative advantage, by way of the contribution to the economic development, by any combination 
having or likely to have appreciable adverse effect on competition; 
 
(n) whether the benefits of the combination outweigh the adverse impact of the combination, if any. 
The above yardsticks are to be taken into account irrespective of fact whether an inquiry is instituted, on 
receipt of notice under Section 6(2) upon its own knowledge. The scope of assessment of adverse effect on 
competition will be confined to the “relevant market”. Most of the facts enumerated in Section 20 (4) are 
external to an enterprise. It is noteworthy that sub clause (n) of Section 20 (4) requires to invoke principles of 
a “balancing”. It requires the Commission to evaluate whether the benefits of the combination outweigh the 
adverse impact of the combination, if any. In other words if the benefits of the combination outweigh the 
adverse effect of the combination, the Commission will approve the combination. Conversely, the 
Commission may declare such a combination as void. 
Reference by statutory authority 
The term “statutory authority” has been defined in Section 2(w). If in the course of a proceeding before any 
statutory authority, an issue is raised by any party that any decision which such authority has taken or 
proposes to take, is or would be, contrary to the provisions of the Competition Act 2002, it may make a 
reference in respect of such issue to the Commission and seek its opinion. The Commission shall, on receipt 
of the reference, after hearing the parties to the proceedings, give its opinion within 60 days of receipt of 
such reference to such authority on the issues referred to it. The statutory authority shall thereafter pass 
EP-EBCL 
268 
such order on the issues referred to the Commission as it deems fit. The statutory authority may, suo motu 
make such reference in respect of such issue to the Commission. Likewise, the Commission either in the 
course of proceedings before it or suo motu may make a reference for opinion to a statutory authority and 
the latter has to render its opinion within 60 days of making a reference. 
Meetings of Commission 
Section 22 provides that the Commission shall meet at such times and places, and shall observe such rules 
and procedure in regard to the transaction of business at its meetings as may be provided by regulations. 
The Chairperson, if for any reason, is unable to attend a meeting of the Commission, the senior-most 
Member present at the meeting, shall preside at the meeting. All questions which come up before any 
meeting of the Commission shall be decided by a majority of the Members present and voting, and in the 
event of an equality of votes, the Chairperson or in his absence, the Member presiding, shall have a second 
or/casting vote. However, the quorum for such meeting shall be three Members. 
Procedure for inquiry on complaints under Section 19 
If the Commission is of the opinion that there exists a prima facie case, on receipt of an information from any 
person, consumer, their association or trade association or on a reference from Central Government or State 
Government or of a statutory authority or on its knowledge or information under Section 19, it shall direct the 
Director General to cause an investigation to be made into the matter. The Director General shall investigate 
into the matter and submit a report of its findings within the period as may be specified by the Commission. It 
is, however, not binding on the Commission to accept the report of the Director General. 
Where upon receipt of a reference or information, the Commission is of the opinion that there is no prima-
facie case, it shall pass an order dismissing the reference/information, as it deems fit and necessary.  
Upon receipt of a report from the Director General, the Commission shall forward a copy thereof to (a) the 
parties concerned or (b) Central Government or (c) State Government or (d) statutory authority as the case 
may be. If the Director General, in relation to a matter referred to it, recommends that there is no 
contravention of any of the provisions of the Act, the Commission shall give an opportunity of hearing to the 
informant and after hearing, if the Commission agrees with the recommendation of the Director General, it 
shall dismiss the information. According to Section 26(7) if, after hearing information provider, the 
Commission is of the opinion that further inquiry is called for, it shall direct the enquiry to proceed further. 
Where the report of the Director General relates to matter referred to Commission by the Central 
Government or a State Government or a statutory authority and the report contains recommendation that 
there is no contravention of the provisions of the Act, the Commission shall invite the comments of the 
Central Government or the State Government or statutory authority, as the case may be, on such report. On 
receipt of the comments, if there is no prima-facie case, in the opinion of the Commission the Commission 
shall return the reference. However, if the Commission feels that there is a prima-facie case it shall proceed 
with a reference. 
Section 26(9) provides that the Commission on receipt of recommendation of Director General that there is 
contravention of any of the provisions of the Act, and a further inquiry is called for, shall inquire into such 
contravention in accordance with the provisions of the Act. 
The provisions of the Section indicate that it is mandatory that information or reference received or a matter 
which comes to the knowledge of the Commission regarding alleged violation of the provisions of the Act, 
must be referred to the Director General for an investigation in the matter. A copy of the report of the Director 
General is required to be sent to the information provider or to the Central Government or State Government 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
269 
or a statutory authority, as the case may be, for their comments and an opportunity of hearing is required to 
be given to the parties as this is warranted by the principles of natural justice. Where the Director General 
recommends that there is contravention of any of the provisions of the Act, and that the Commission is of 
opinion that further inquiry is called for, it shall institute an inquiry into the matter and pass a reasoned order. 
The Commission may or may not subscribe to the recommendations of the Director General. 
Orders by Commission after inquiry into agreements or abuse of dominant position 
Section 27 envisages that the Commission after any inquiry into agreement entered into by any enterprise or 
association of enterprises or person or association of persons, or an inquiry into abuse of dominant position 
may pass all or any of the following orders, namely, 
 
(i) direct that such agreement, or abuse of dominant position shall be discontinued and such 
agreement, which is in contravention of Section 3 shall not be re-entered or the abuse of dominant 
position in contravention of Section 4 shall be discontinued, as the case may be. The direction to 
discontinue and not to recur is commonly known as “Cease & desist” order. 
 
(ii) the Commission may impose penalty not exceeding ten percent of the average turnover of last three 
preceding financial years, upon each of person or enterprises which are parties to such agreement 
in contravention of Section 3 or are abusing dominant position within meaning of Section 4. 
 
 In case any agreement which is prohibited by Section 3 has been entered into by any cartel, the 
Commission may impose upon each producer, seller, distributor, trader or service provider 
participating in that cartel, a penalty up to three times of its profits for each year of the continuance 
of such agreement whichever is higher. 
 
(iii) The Commission may direct that the agreements shall stand modified to the extent and in the 
manner as specified in the order. 
 
(iv) The Commission may direct the enterprises concerned to comply with such other orders and 
directions, including payment of cost, if any, as it deems fit. 
 
(v) to pass such order or issue such directions as it may deem fit.

order in writing, direct division of an enterprise enjoying dominant position to ensure that such enterprise or 
group does not abuse its dominant position.  
The order of the Commission referred to above may provide for all or any of the following matters, namely 
 
(a) the transfer or vesting of property, rights, liabilities or obligations; 
 
(b) the adjustment of contracts either by discharge or reduction of any liability or obligation or otherwise; 
 
(c) the creation, allotment, surrender or cancellation of any shares, stocks or securities; 
 
(d) the formation or winding up of an enterprise or the amendment of the memorandum of association 
or articles of association or any other instruments regulating the business of any enterprise; 
 
(e) the extent to which, and the circumstances in which, provisions of the order affecting an enterprise 
may be altered by the enterprise and the registration thereof; 
 
(f) any other matter which may be necessary to give effect to the division of the enterprise or group.

Procedure for investigation of combination 
The procedure for investigation by the Commission has been stipulated under Section 29 of the Act. It 
involves following stages - 
 
(i) The Commission first has to form a prima facie opinion that a combination is likely to cause, or has 
caused an appreciable adverse effect on competition within the relevant market in India. Further, 
when the Commission has come to such a conclusion then it shall proceed to issue a notice to the 
parties to the combination, calling upon them to show cause why an investigation in respect of such 
combination should not be conducted; 
 
(ii) After receipt of the response of the parties to the combination Commission may call for the report of 
the Director General. 
 
(iii) When pursuant to response of parties or on receipt of report of the Director General whichever is 
later, the Commission prima-facie is of the opinion that the Combination is likely to cause an 
appreciable adverse effect on competition in relevant market, it shall, within seven days direct the 
parties to the combination to publish within ten working days, the details of the combination, in such 
manner as it thinks appropriate so as, to bring to the information of public and persons likely to be 
affected by such combination. 
 
(iv) The Commission may invite any person affected or likely to be affected by the said combination, to 
file his written objections within fifteen working days of the publishing of the public notice, with the 
Commission for its consideration. 
 
(v) The Commission may, within fifteen working days of the filing of written objections, call for such 
additional or other information as it deem fit from the parties to the said combination and the 
information shall be furnished by the parties above referred within fifteen days from the expiry of the 
period notified by the Commission.  
 
(vi) After receipt of all the information and within forty-five days from expiry of period for filing further 
information, the Commission shall proceed to deal with the case, in accordance with provisions 
contained in Section 31 of the Act. 
Thus, the provisions of Section 29 provide for a specified timetable within which the parties to the 
combination or parties likely to be affected by the combination are required to submit the information or 
further information to the Commission to ensure prompt and timely conduct of the investigation. It further 
imposes on Commission a time limit of forty-five working days from the receipt of additional or other 
information called for by it under sub-Section (4) of Section 29 for dealing with the case of investigation into a 
combination, which may have an adverse effect of the competition. 
Inquiry into disclosures under Section 6(2) 
Section 6(2) casts an obligation on any person or enterprise, who or which proposes to enter into 
combination, shall give notice to the Commission, in the form as may be specified, and the fee which may be 
determined, by regulations, disclosing the details of the proposed combination within thirty days of— 
 
(i) approval of the proposal relating to merger or amalgamation by the board of directors of the 
enterprises concerned with such merger or amalgamation; 
 
(ii)  execution of any agreement or other document for acquisition referred to in Section 5(a) or 
acquiring of control referred to in Section 5(b). 
Non-filing of notice attracts penalty in terms of Section 43A of the Act. 
The newly inserted section 6(2A) envisages that no combination shall come into effect until two hundred and 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
271 
ten days have passed from the day on which notice has been given to Commission or the Commission has 
passed orders, whichever is earlier. 
Upon receipt of such notice, the Commission shall examine such notice and form its prima facie opinion as to 
whether the combination has, or is likely to have, an appreciable adverse effect on the competition in the 
relevant market in India. 
Orders of Commission on Certain Combinations 
The Commission, after consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances of the case under investigation, 
by it under Sections 28 or 30 and assessing the effect of any combination on the relevant market in India, 
may pass any of the written orders indicated herein below. Where the Commission comes to a conclusion 
that any combination does not, or is not likely to, have an appreciable adverse effect on the Competition in 
relevant market in India, it may, approve that Combination. 
 
(i) In the case where the Commission is of the opinion that the combination has, or is likely to have an 
adverse effect on competition, it shall direct that the combination shall not take effect. 
 
(ii) Where the Commission is of the opinion that adverse effect which has been caused or is likely to be 
caused on competition can be eliminated by modifying such Combination then it shall direct the 
parties to such combination to carry out necessary modifications to the Combination. 
 
(iii) The parties accepting the proposed modification shall carry out such modification within the period 
specified by the Commission. 
 
(iv) Where the parties who have accepted the modification, fail to carry out such modification within the 
period specified by the Commission, such combination shall be deemed to have an appreciable 
adverse effect on competition and shall be dealt with by the Commission in accordance with the 
provisions of the Act. 
 
(v) If the parties to the Combination do not accept the proposed modification such parties may within thirty 
days of modification proposed by the Commission, submit amendment to the modification proposed 
by the Commission. 
 
(vi) If the Commission agrees with the agreement submitted by the parties it shall, by an order approve 
the combination. 
 (vii) If the Commission does not accept the amendment then, parties shall be allowed a further period of 
thirty days for accepting the amendment proposed by the Commission. 
 (viii) Where the parties to the combination fail to accept the modification within thirty days, then it shall be 
deemed that the combination has an appreciable adverse effect on Competition and will be dealt 
with in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  
 
(ix) Where the Commission directs under Section 31 (2) that the combination shall not take effect or it 
has, or is likely to have an appreciable adverse effect, it may order that, 
 
(a) the acquisition referred to in Section 5 (a); or  
 
(b) the acquiring of control referred to in Section 5(b); or 
 
(c) the merger or the amalgamation referred to in Section 5(c) shall not be given effect to by the 
parties. 
 
 As per proviso the Commission may, if it considers appropriate, frame a scheme to implement its 
order in regard to the above matters under Section 31(10).  
EP-EBCL 
272 
 
(x) A deeming provision has been introduced by Section 31(11). It provides that, if the Commission 
does not, on expiry of a period of two hundred ten days from the date of filing of notice under 
Section 6(2) pass an order or issue any direction in accordance with the provisions of Section 29(1) 
or Section 29(2) or Section 29(7), the combination shall be deemed to have been approved by the 
Commission. In reckoning the period of two hundred ten days, the period of thirty days specified in 
Section 29(6) and further period of thirty working days specified in Section 29(8) granted by 
Commission shall be excluded.  
 
(xi) Further more where extension of time is granted on the request of parties the period of two hundred 
ten days shall be reckoned after deducting extended time granted at the request of the parties. 
 (xii) Where the Commission has ordered that a combination is void, as it has an appreciable adverse 
effect on competition, the acquisition or acquiring of control or merger or amalgamation referred to 
in Section 5, shall be dealt with by other concerned authorities under any other law for the time 
being in force as if such acquisition or acquiring of control or merger or amalgamation had not taken 
place and the parties to the combination shall be dealt with accordingly. 
 (xiii) Section 29(14) makes it clear that nothing contained in Chapter IV of the Act shall affect any 
proceeding initiated or may be initiated under any other law for the time being in force. It implies that 
provisions of this Act are in addition to and not in derogation of provisions of other Acts. 
Thus, approval under one law does not make out a case for approval under another law. 
Acts taking place outside India but having an effect on Competition in India 
Section 32 extends the jurisdiction of Competition Commission of India to inquire and pass orders in 
accordance with the provisions of the Act into an agreement or dominant position or combination, which is 
likely to have, an appreciable adverse effect on competition in relevant market in India, notwithstanding that, 
 
(a) an agreement referred to in Section 3 has been entered into outside India; or 
 
(b) any party to such agreement is outside India; or 
 
(c) any enterprise abusing the dominant position is outside India; or 
 
(d) a combination has taken place outside India; or 
 
(e) any party to combination is outside India; or 
 
(f) any other matter or practice or action arising out of such agreement or dominant position or 
combination is outside India.  
The above clearly demonstrates that acts taking place outside India but having an effect on competition in 
India will be subject to the jurisdiction of Commission. The Competition Commission of India will have 
jurisdiction even if both the parties to an agreement are outside India but only if the agreement, dominant 
position or combination entered into by them has an appreciable adverse effect on competition in the 
relevant market of India.  
Appearance before Commission 
As per Section 35 of the Act, following persons are entitled to appear before the Commission 
 
(i) a complainant; or 
 
(ii) a defendant; or 
 
(iii) the Director General  
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002

1959) and who has obtained a certificate of practice; 
 
(d) a legal practitioner that is an advocate, vakil or an attorney of any High Court including a pleader in 
practice. 
 
 
The above provisions unambiguously state that a ‘Company Secretary in Practice’ is 
entitled to represent an informant or a defendant or Director General. A Company 
Secretary in Practice can also get himself empanelled with the Director General to 
prosecute his cases before the Commission. 
Power of Commission to regulate its own procedure 
The Competition Commission of India has been empowered to lay down its own procedure and regulations. 
It is not bound by the procedure laid down by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 but shall have to observe 
the principles of natural justice and subject to the provisions of the Act. The Competition Commission of India 
shall also be subject to the rules made by the Central Government. Section 36(2) makes it clear that the 
Commission shall have the same powers as are vested in a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 
1908 while trying the suit, in respect of the following matters, namely:

EP-EBCL 
274 
In terms of Section 36(4), the Commission may direct any person –  
 
(a) to produce before the Director General or the Secretary or an officer authorized by it, such books, or 
other documents in the custody or under the control of such person so directed as may be specified

be required for the purposes of the Act; 
 
(b) to furnish to the Director General or the Secretary or any other officer authorized by it, as respects 
the trade or such other information as may be in his possession in relation to the trade carried on by 
such person, as may be required for the purposes of the Act.

commerce, accountancy, international trade or from any other discipline as it deems necessary, to assist in 
the conduct of any inquiry or proceeding before it. 
As stated earlier, Director General is an important functionary assisting the Commission and the Commission 
may ask the Director General to investigate into any trade practice and for the purpose of examination of 
books, or account and other document of the parties concerned. The Director General is also vested with all 
the powers as are conferred upon the Commission under Section 36(2) of Act.

any mistake apparent from the record. Section 38(2) provides that subject to other provisions of this Act, the 
Commission may make – 
 
(a) an amendment of an order of its own motion; 
 
(b) an amendment for rectifying any mistake apparent from record, which has been brought to its notice 
by any party to the order. 
An explanation below the Section clarifies that while rectifying any mistake apparent from the record, the 
Commission shall not amend substantive part of the order passed by it under the provisions of this Act. 
Execution of Orders of the Commission Imposing Monetary penalty 
Section 39 provides that if a person fails to pay any monetary penalty imposed on him under the Act, the 
Commission shall proceed to recover such penalty, in such manner as may be specified by the regulations. 
In a case where the Commission is of the opinion that it would be expedient to recover the penalty imposed 
under the Act in accordance with the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961, it may make a reference to this 
effect to the concerned income-tax authority under that Act for recovery of the penalty as tax due under the 
said Act. 
Where a reference has been made by the Commission under sub-section (2) for recovery of penalty, the 
person upon whom the penalty has been imposed shall be deemed to be the assessee in default under the 
Income Tax Act, 1961 and the provisions contained in sections 221 to 227, 228A, 229, 231 and 232 of the 
said Act and the Second Schedule to that Act and any rules made there under shall, in so far as may be, 
apply as if the said provisions were the provisions of this Act and referred to sums by way of penalty imposed 
under this Act instead of to income-tax and sums imposed by way of penalty, fine, and interest under the 
Income–tax Act, 1961 and to the Commission instead of the Assessing Officer.

1961 (43 of 1961), in the said provisions of that Act or the rules made thereunder shall be construed as 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
275 
references to sections 43 to 45 of this Act. 
Explanation 2 – The Tax Recovery Commissioner and the Tax Recovery Officer referred to in the Income-tax 
Act, 1961 shall be deemed to be the Tax Recovery Commissioner and the Tax Recovery Officer for the 
purposes of recovery of sums imposed by way of penalty under this Act and reference made by the 
Commission under sub-section (2) would amount to drawing of a certificate by the Tax Recovery Officer as 
far as demand relating to penalty under this Act. 
Explanation 3– Any reference to appeal in Chapter XVIID and the Second Schedule to the Income-tax Act, 
1961 shall be construed as a reference to appeal before the Competition Appellate Tribunal under section 
53B of this Act. 
It would be noted that Commission may by its Regulations has been empowered to evolve procedure of 
recovering monetary penalty. It may also make reference to Income Tax Authority for recovering of penalty 
as tax due under the said Act. 
As per Section 39, every order passed by the Commission under this Act shall be executed in the same 
manner as if it were a decree or order made by the High Court or the Principal Civil Court in any suit pending 
therein.  
It shall be lawful for the Commission to send, in event of its inability to execute it such order to the High Court 
or to the Principal Civil Court, as the case may be, within the limits of whose jurisdiction—

Duties of Director General 
The Act provides that the Director General when so directed by the Commission, is to assist the Commission 
in investigation into any contravention of the provisions of this Act. The Director General is bound to comply 
with such a direction to render requisite assistance to the Commission. 
The Director General, in order to effectively discharge his functions, has been given the same powers as are 
conferred upon the Commission under section 36(2). Under section 36(2) the Commission is having same 
powers as are vested in Civil Court under the Code of Civil Procedure (1908) while trying a suit, in respect of

Without prejudice to the above powers, the provisions of Sections 240 and 240A of the Companies Act, 
1956, so far as may be, shall apply to an investigation made by the Director General or by a person 
authorised by him, as they apply to an inspector under the Companies Act 1956. This power includes search 
and seizure of the record of any person in respect of which an investigation has been directed by the 
Commission. It has been provided that wherever the approval of the Central Government is required, the 
same shall be given by the Commission and the word ‘magistrate’ appearing in Section 240A shall be 
construed as the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate.  
Penalties 
The Competition Act prescribes penalties for contravention of orders of the Commission. As per Section 42, 
the Commission may cause an inquiry to be made into compliance of its orders or directions and  
 
(a) if any person, without any reasonable cause, fails to comply with any order of the Commission, or

(b) if any person fails to pay the penalty imposed under the Act, 
he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine which may

Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi, however, shall not take cognizance of any offence save as a complaint 
filed by Commission or any of its officers authorized by it.  
Compensation in case of Contravention of Orders of commission 
Section 42A provides that without prejudice to the provisions of this Act, any person may make an

Penalty for making false statement 
Section 44 provides that If any person, being a party to a combination, makes a statement which is false in 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
277 
any material particular, or knowing it to be false; or omits to state any material particular knowing it to be 
material, such person shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than rupees fifty lakhs but which 
may extend to rupees one crore, as may be determined by the Commission. 
Power to impose lesser penalty 
If any producer, seller, distributor, trader or service provider included in any cartel, which is alleged to have 
violated Section 3, has made a full and true disclosure in respect of alleged violations and such a disclosure 
is vital, the Commission may impose upon him a lesser penalty than as prescribed under the Act or rules or 
regulations. 
However, the lesser penalty shall not be imposed where before making such disclosure, the report of 
Director General under Section 26 has been received in the Commission. Further, the lesser penalty shall be 
imposed only in respect of the producer, seller, distributor, trader or service provider included in the cartel, 
who has made a full, true and vital disclosures under this Section. Any producer, seller, trader or service 
provider included in the cartel shall also be liable to imposition of penalty, if in the course of proceedings, 
had, 
 
(a) not complied with the condition on which the lesser penalty was imposed by the Commission; or 
 
(b) given false evidence; or 
 
(c) the disclosure made is not vital. 
The lesser penalty is for a member of a ring who breaks the rank. There is no provision to provide any 
protection or incentive to a whistle blower, which is conferred upon Authorities in contemporary legislations 
abroad.  
The Act does not vest power in the Commission to compound an offence as was the position under the 
MRTP Act. It is viewed that long drawn investigation and enquiries could be arrested by provision such as 
compounding which allows an offence to be settled quickly. The Commission is also not vested with power to 
contempt. 
Contravention by Companies 
A company means a body corporate and includes a firm or other association of individuals; director, in 
relation to a firm, means a partner in the firm for the purposes of penalties in connection with contravention of 
the provisions of the Act by companies. 
Where any rule, regulation, order made by the Commission or any direction issued thereunder is 
contravened by a company, every person who, at the time the contravention was committed, was in charge, 
and was responsible to the company for conducting business of the company, as well as the company, shall 
be deemed to be guilty of the contravention and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished. 
However it will be a good defence by a person liable to any punishment if he proves that the contravention 
was committed without his knowledge or that he has exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of 
an offence. 
Where a contravention of any of the provisions of this Act or any rule, regulation, order made or direction issued 
thereunder has been committed by a company and it is proved that contravention has taken place with the 
consent or connivance of, or it is attributable to any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or 
other officer of the company, such director, manager, secretary or other officer shall also be deemed to be 
guilty of the contravention and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly. 
EP-EBCL 
278 
The word company in this Section, has been used in a wider sense and also includes a ‘firm’ or an ‘association 
of persons’. Though the word ‘director’ is normally used in a company, in the light of the wider definition, the 
term director is interpreted to include a partner of the firm. The company being a legal person, its affairs are 
conducted by a board of directors, manager, secretary or other officer, therefore, according to Section 48 (2) 
such director, manager, secretary or other officer, in addition to the company itself shall be deemed to be liable 
to be proceeded against for contravention of any provisions of this Act or any rule, regulation, order made or 
direction issued thereunder by the Commission or the Director General of Investigation. 
Competition Advocacy 
Under Section 49 the Central Government/State Government may seek the opinion of the CCI on the 
possible effects of the policy on competition or any other matter. In this context, Section 49 envisages that 
while formulating a policy on the competition, the Government may make a reference to the Commission for 
its opinion on possible effect of such a policy on the competition, or any other matter. 
On receipt of such a reference, the Commission shall, give its opinion on it to the Central Government/State 
Government, within sixty days of making such a reference and the latter may formulate the policy as it

binding upon the Central Government/State Government in formulating such a policy. The Commission is

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Every individual is a consumer, regardless of 
occupation, age, gender, community, cast, creed, 
religion or race. Consumer rights and welfare are an 
integral part of the life of an individual and we all 
have made use of them at some or the other point in 
our daily routine. Consumer is the real deciding 
factor for all economic activities. It is now universally 
accepted that the extent of consumer protection is a 
true indicator of the level of progress in a nation. 
Taking into account the interests and needs of 
consumers in all countries, particularly those in 
developing countries, recognizing that consumers 
often 
face 
imbalances 
in 
economic 
terms, 
educational level and bargaining power, and bearing 
in mind that consumer should have the right of 
access to non-hazardous products, as well as 
importance 
of 
promoting 
just, 
equitable 
and 
sustainable economic and social development, the 
Secretary General, United Nations submitted draft 
guidelines for consumer protection to the Economic 
and Social Council in 1983. Thereupon on an 
extensive discussions and negotiations among 
various countries on the scope and content of such 
impending legislation certain guidelines were arrived 
at.  
In line with the international development on 
consumer 
protection, 
the 
Parliament 
enacted 
Consumer Protection Act, 1986 provides a forum for 
speedy and simple redressal of consumer disputes. 
The rights under the consumer protection flow from 
the rights enshrined in Articles 14 to 19 of the 
Constitution of India.  
 
  
According to the preamble, the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 to provide for better protection of the interests of 
consumers and for that purpose to make provision for the establishment of consumer councils and other authorities for 
the settlement of consumer’s disputes and for matters connected therewith. 
LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL 
290 
INTRODUCTION 
A consumer is a user of goods and services, therefore, every producer is also a consumer. However, 
conflicting interests have categorised them, inevitably, into two different groups. The industrial revolution 
brought in the concept of standardisation and mass production and over the years, the type of goods and the 
nature of services available grew manifold. The doctrine of ‘Caveat Emptor’ or ‘let the buyer beware’ which 
came into existence in the middle ages had been replaced by the principle of ‘Consumer Sovereignty or 
‘Consumer is the King’. But, with tremendous increase in the world population, the growing markets were 
unable to meet the rising demand which created a gap between the general ‘demand’ and ‘supply’ levels in 
the markets. This to some extent watered down the concept of ‘Consumer Sovereignty’, what with 
consumers being forced to accept whatever was offered to them. On the other hand, the expanding markets 
necessitated the introduction of various intermediaries between the producer and the ultimate consumer. 
‘Advertising’, though ostensibly directed at informing potential consumers about the availability and uses of a 
product began to be resorted to as a medium for exaggerating the uses of ones products or disparaging 
others products so as to have an edge over competitors. Unfair and deceptive practices such as selling of 
defective or sub-standard goods, charging exhorbitant prices, misrepresenting the efficacy or usefulness of 
goods, negligence as to safety standards, etc. became rampant. It, therefore, became necessary to evolve 
statutory measures, even in developed countries, to make producers/traders more accountable to 
consumers. It also became inevitable for consumers to unite on a common platform to deal with issues of 
common concern and having their grievances redressed satisfactorily. 
Genesis of Consumer Protection Laws 
The need to ensure the basic rights to health, safety, etc. of consumers has long been recognised the world 
over and various general legislations were enacted in India and abroad in this direction. In India, the general 
enactments other than the law of torts which ultimately aimed at protection of consumers interests are the 
Indian Contract Act, 1872, the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930, the Agricultural 
Produce (Grading and Marketing) Act, 1937, the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, the Indian Standards 
Institution (Certification Marks) Act, 1952, the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954, the Drugs and 
Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954, the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, the 
Standards of Weights and Measures Act, 1976 (Now Legal Metrology Act, 2009), the Trade and 
Merchandise Marks Act, 1958, (Now Trade Marks Act, 1999), the Patents Act, 1970, the Hire Purchases Act, 
1972 and the Prevention of Black Marketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 
1980. 
These legislations contained regulatory provisions and contravention of these provisions attracted civil 
liability. This meant that an ordinary consumer had no other remedy but to initiate action by way of a civil suit 
which involved lengthy legal process proving to be too expensive and time consuming for lay consumers. In 
fact, at times, the time and cost involved in the legal process was disproportionate to the compensation 
claimed and granted to an individual consumer. Though the MRTP Commission proved to be far more 
accessible and less time-consuming than the Civil Courts, its single central location at New Delhi did not 
make the redressal agency accessible to all consumers, especially those located in the remote towns and 
villages of the country. Therefore, it became necessary to evolve laws directed at protecting the consumers 
and at the same time, providing for remedies which are simpler, more accessible, quicker and less 
expensive. 
This paved the way for enactment of the Consumer Protection Act in 1986 providing for simple, quick and 
easy remedy to consumers under a three-tier quasi-judicial redressal agency at the District, State and 
National levels. To make the Act more effective and meaningful, necessary changes have been brought by 
Consumer Protection (Amendment) Act, 2002, which came into force w.e.f. March 15, 2003. 
                                                                         Lesson 13         Consumer Protection Act, 1986 
291 
The Basic Rights of Consumers 
The basic rights of consumers that are sought to be promoted and protected are: 
• the right to be protected against marketing of goods and services which are hazardous to life and 
property; 
• the right to be informed about the quality, quantity, potency, purity, standard and price of goods, or 
services so as to protect the consumer against unfair trade practices; 
• the right to be assured, wherever possible, access to variety of goods and services at competitive 
prices; 
• the right to be heard and to be assured that consumers interests will receive due consideration at 
appropriate forums; 
• the right to seek redressal against unfair trade practices or restrictive trade practices or unscrupulous 
exploitation of consumers; and 
• right to consumer education. 
This is based on the basic rights of consumers as defined by the International Organisation of Consumers 
(IOCU) viz., the Rights to Safety, to Information, of Choice, to be Heard, to Redressal, to Consumer 
Education, to Healthy Environment and to Basic Needs. 
SCOPE OF THE ACT 
The Act extends to the whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir and applies to all goods and 
services unless otherwise notified by the Central Government. The Act received the Presidents assent on 
24.12.1986. However, all provisions of the Act except those relating to establishment, composition, 
jurisdiction, etc. of the Consumer Disputes Agencies (which came into force on 1.7.1987) came into force on 
15.4.1987. 
DEFINITIONS 
Section 2(1) of the Act defines various terms used in the Act. Some of the definitions are given hereunder: 
Complainant means 
 
(i) a consumer, or 
 
(ii) any voluntary consumer association registered under the Companies Act, 1956, or under any other 
law for the time being in force; or 
 
(iii) the Central Government or any State Government, who or which makes a complaint; or 
 
(iv) one or more consumers where there are numerous consumers having the same interest; 
 
(v) in case of death of a consumer, his legal heir or representative; who or which makes a complaint 
[Section 2(1)(b)]. 
An association of persons, to have locus standi as consumer, it is necessary that all the individual persons 
forming the association must be consumers under Section 2(1)(d) of the Act having purchased the same 
goods/hired the same service from the same party i.e. they should have a common cause of action. Thus, 
unlike MRTP Act, 1969, the Redressal Machinery under Consumer Protection Act, 1986 has no power to 
initiate cases suo-moto. 
EP-EBCL 
292 
Complaint means any allegation in writing made, with a view to obtaining any relief, by a complainant that 
 
(i) an unfair trade practice or a restrictive trade practice has been adopted by any trader or service 
provider; 
 
(ii) the goods bought by him or agreed to be bought by him suffer from one or more defects; 
 
(iii) the services hired or availed of or agreed to be hired or availed of by him suffer from deficiency in 
any respect; 
 
(iv) a trader or the service provider, as the case may be, has charged for the goods or for the services 
mentioned in the complaint, a price in excess of the price— 
 
— fixed by or under any law for the time being in force; 
 
— displayed on the goods or any package containing such goods; 
 
— displayed on the price list exhibited by him by or under any law for the time being in force 
 
— agreed between the parties. 
 
(v) goods which will be hazardous to life and safety when used are being offered for sale to the 
public,— 
 
— in contravention of any standards relating to safety of such goods as required to be complied 
with, by or under any law for the time being in force; 
 
— if the trader could have known with due diligence that the goods so offered are unsafe to the 
public. 
 
(vi) services which are hazardous or likely to be hazardous to life and safety of the public when used, 
are being offered by the service provider which such person could have known with due diligence to 
be injurious to life and safety. [Section 2(1)(c)]. 
Consumer means any person who 
 
(a) buys any goods for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly 
promised, or under any system of deferred payment and includes any user of such goods other than 
the person who buys such goods for consideration paid or promised or partly paid or partly 
promised, or under any system of deferred payment when such use is made with the approval of 
such person, but does not include a person who obtains such goods for resale or for any 
commercial purpose; or 
 
(b) hires or avails of any services for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid 
and partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment and includes any beneficiary of such 
services other than the person who hires or avails of the services for consideration paid or 
promised, or partly paid and partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment, when such 
services are availed of with the approval of the first mentioned person but does not include a person 
who avails of such services for any commercial purpose. [Section 2(1)(d)]. 
It has been clarified that the term commercial purpose does not include use by a consumer of goods bought 
and used by him exclusively for the purpose of earning his livelihood by means of self-employment. 
Therefore, to be a ‘consumer’ under the Act: 
 
(i) the goods or services must have been purchased or hired or availed of for consideration which has 
been paid in full or in part or under any system of deferred payment, i.e. in respect of hire purchase 
                                                                         Lesson 13         Consumer Protection Act, 1986 
293 
transactions; 
 
(ii) goods purchased should not be meant for re-sale or for a commercial purpose. Goods purchased 
by a dealer in the ordinary course of his business and those which are in the course of his business 
to supply would be deemed to be for  re-sale; and 
 
(iii) in addition to the purchaser(s) of goods, or hirer(s) or users of services, any beneficiary of such 
services, using the goods/services with the approval of the purchaser or hirer or user would also be 
deemed a ‘consumer under the Act. 
A purchase of goods can be said to be for a ‘commercial purpose only if the goods have been purchased for 
being used in some profit making activity on a large-scale, and there is close and direct nexus between the 
purchase of goods and the profit-making activity. In Laxmi Engineering Works v. P.S.G. Industrial Institute, 
Supreme Court held that the explanation to Section 2(1)(d) is clarificatory in nature. It observed that whether 
the purpose for which a person has bought goods is a ‘commercial purpose’ is always a question of facts and 
to be decided in the facts and circumstances of each case. If the commercial use is by the purchaser himself 
for the purpose of earning his livelihood by means of self employment such purchaser of goods would yet be 
a consumer. The Supreme Court further observed that if a person purchased a machine to operate it himself 
for earning his livelihood, he would be a consumer. If such person took the assistance of one or two persons 
to assist him in operating the machine, he would still be a consumer. But if a person purchases a machine 
and appoint or engage another person exclusively to operate the machine, then such person would not be a 
consumer. 
In Bhupendra Jang Bahadur Guna v. Regional Manager and Others (II 1995 CPJ 139), the National 
Commission held that a tractor purchased primarily to till the land of the purchaser and let out on hire during 
the idle time to till the lands of others would not amount to commercial use. 
The question as to whether the widow of the deceased policy holder was a ‘consumer’ under the Act was 
decided in the affirmative by the State Commission in Andhra Pradesh in the case of A Narasamma v. LIC of 
India. The State Commission held that as the term ‘consumer’ includes any beneficiary of service other than 
the person who hires the services for consideration, the widow being the beneficiary of services is a 
‘consumer’ under the Act entitled to be compensated for the loss suffered by her due to negligence of the 
LIC. 
In Laxmiben Laxmichand Shah v. Sakerben Kanji Chandan and others 2001 CTJ 401 (Supreme Court) (CP), 
the Supreme Court held that the tenant entering into lease agreement with the landlord cannot be 
consideredas consumer under Section 2(1)(d) of the Act. Where there was no provision in the lease 
agreement inrespect of cleaning, repairing and maintaining the building, the rent paid by tenant is not the 
consideration foravailing these services and therefore, no question of deficiency in service. 
Goods, in terms of Section 2(1)(i) has been defined to mean goods as defined in the Sale of Goods 
Act,1930. As per Section 2(7) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 Goods means every kind of movable property 
other than actionable claims and money; and includes stock and shares, growing crops, grass and things 
attached to or forming part of the land, which are agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract of 
sale. Therefore, most consumer products come under the purview of this definition. 
In Morgan Stanley Mutual Fund v. Kartik Das (1994) 3 CLJ 27, the Supreme Court held that an application 
for allotment of shares cannot constitute goods. It is after allotment, rights may arise as per the articles of 
association of the company. At the stage of application there is no purchase of goods for consideration and 
again the purchaser cannot be called the hirer of services for consideration. 
EP-EBCL 
294 
Service:  The term ‘service’ is defined under Section 2(1)(o) as to mean service of any description which is 
made available to potential users and includes, but not limited to the provision of facilities in connection with 
banking, financing, insurance, transport, processing, supply of electrical or other energy, board or lodging or 
both, housing construction, entertainment, amusement or the purveying of news or other information, but 
does not include the rendering of any service free of charge or under a contract of personal service. 
Passengers travelling by trains on payment of the stipulated fare charged for the ticket are ‘consumers’ and 
the facility of transportation by rail provided by the railway administration is a ‘service’ rendered for 
consideration as defined in the Act Subscribers of telephones would also be ‘consumer’ under the Act. 
Contract of Service and Contract for Service 
The Supreme Court in the case of Indian Merchants Association v. V P Shantha, (CA No. 688 of 1993 
decided on 13th November 1995) observed that a contract for service implies a contract whereby one party 
undertakes to render services e.g. professional or technical services to or for another in the performance of 
which he is not subject to detailed direction and control but exercises professional or technical skill and uses 
his own knowledge and discretion. A contract of service on the other hand implies relationship of master and 
servant and involves an obligation to obey orders in the work to be performed and as to its mode and 
manner of performance. The Parliamentary draftsman was well aware of this well-accepted distinction 
between ‘contract of service’ and ‘contract for services’ and had deliberately chosen the expression ‘contract 
of service’ instead of the expression ‘contract for service’ in the exclusionary part of the definition of ‘service’, 
this being the reason being that an employer could not be regarded as a consumer in respect of the services 
rendered by his employee in pursuance of contract of employment. By affixing the adjective ‘personal’ to the 
word ‘service’ the nature of the contracts which were excluded were not altered. The adjective only 
emphasised that what was sought to be excluded was personal service only. The expression contract of 
personal service in the exclusionary part of Section 2(1)(o) must, therefore, be construed as excluding the 
services rendered by an employee to his employer under the contract of personal service free from the ambit 
of the expression service. 
Service Rendered under Medicare Insurance Scheme:  Service rendered by a medical practitioner or 
hospital/nursing home can not be regarded as service rendered free of charge, if the person availing the 
service has taken an insurance policy for medical care whereunder the charges for consultation, diagnosis 
and medical treatment are borne by the insurance company and such service would fall within the ambit of 
‘service’ as defined in Section 2(1)(o). Similarly, where as a part of the conditions of service, the employer 
bears the expenses of medical treatment of an employee and his family members dependent on him, service 
rendered to such an employee and his family members would not be free of charge and would constitute 
‘service’ under Section 2(1)(o) of the Act. 
In State of Haryana v. Santra [2000(3) SCALE 417], the Supreme Court held that in a country where the 
population has been increasing rapidly and the Government has taken up the family planning as an 
important programme, the medical officer as also the State Government must be held responsible in 
damages if the family planning operation is a failure on account of the medical officers negligence because 
this has created additional burden on the parents of the child. 
In the case of Alex J. Rebello v. Vice Chancellor, Banglore University and others, 2003 CTJ 575 (CP) 
(NCDRC) the National Commission has held that the University in conducting examination, evaluating 
answer sheets and publishing the result was not performing any service for consideration and a candidate 
who appeared for the examination cannot be regared as a consumer. 
Consumer Dispute means a dispute where the person against whom a complaint has been made, denies or 
disputes the allegation contained in the complaint [Section 2(1)(e)]. 
                                                                         Lesson 13         Consumer Protection Act, 1986 
295 
Restrictive Trade Practice means a trade practice which tends to bring about manipulation of price or its 
conditions of delivery or to affect flow of supplies in the market relating to goods or services in such a 
manner as to impose on the consumers unjustified costs or restrictions and shall include— 
 
(a) delay beyond the period agreed to by a trader in supply of such goods or in providing the services 
which has led or is likely to lead to rise in the price; 
 
(b) any trade practice which requires a consumer to buy, hire or avail of any goods or, as the case may 
be, services as condition precedent to buying, hiring or availing of other goods or services.[Section 
2(1)(nn)]. 
Defect means any fault, imperfection or shortcoming in the quality, quantity, potency, purity or standard 
which is required to be maintained by or under any law for the time being in force or under any contract, 
express or implied, or as is claimed by the trader in any manner whatsoever in relation to any goods [Section 
2(1)(f)]. 
It is clear from the above definition that non-fulfilment of any of the standards or requirements laid down 
under any law for the time being in force or as claimed by the trader in relation to any goods fall under the 
ambit of defect. Therefore, contravention of any of the provisions of enactments such as the Drugs & 
Cosmetics Act, 1950, , the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1955, the Indian Standards Institution 
(Certification Marks) Act, 1952 etc. or any rules framed under any such enactment or contravention of the 
conditions or implied warranties under the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 in relation to any goods have also been 
treated as a defect under the Act. Fault, imperfection or shortcoming in quality, quantity, potency, purity or 
standard as claimed by the trader in any manner whatsoever in relation to goods is to be determined with 
reference to the warranties or guarantees expressly given by a trader. 
Deficiency means any fault, imperfection, shortcoming or inadequacy in the quality, nature and manner of 
performance which is required to be maintained by or under any law for the time being in force or has been 
undertaken to be performed by a person in pursuance of a contract or otherwise in relation to any service 
[Section 2(1)(g)]. 
Failure to maintain the quality of performance required by the law or failure to provide services as per 
warranties given, by the provider of the service would amount to ‘deficiency’. 
In Divisional Manager, LIC of India v. Bhavanam Srinivas Reddy, the National Commission observed that 
default or negligence in regard to settlement of an insurance claim (on allegation of suppression of material 
facts, in this particular case) would constitute a deficiency in service on the part of the insurance company 
and it will be perfectly open for the aggrieved consumer to approach the Redressal Forums to seek 
appropriate relief. 
In Jaipur Metals and Electrical Ltd. v. Laxmi Industries, the National Commission held that a reading of 
Section 2(1)(g) of the Act shows that deficiency must pertain to the ‘performance’ in terms of quality, nature 
and manner to be maintained or had been undertaken to be performed in pursuance of a contract. 
In Punjab National Bank v. K.B. Shetty (First Appeal No. 7 of 1991 decided on 6th August, 1991), ornaments 
kept in the banks locker were found lost though the certificate recorded by the custodian of the bank on the 
day the customer operated the locker stated that all lockers operated during the day have been checked and 
found properly locked. The National Commission upholding the decision of the State Commission, held the 
bank guilty of negligence and therefore, liable to make good the loss.  
However, failure to provide nursing and financing facilities to a small scale industry which consequently 
became sick cannot be said to constitute ‘deficiency in service’ as in matters of grant or withholding of further 
EP-EBCL 
296 
advances and insisting on margin money, banks may exercise their discretion and act in accordance with 
their best judgement after taking into account various relevant factors. Therefore, the proper forum to agitate 
such grievances is a civil court (Special Machines v. Punjab National Bank, Original Petition No. 32/1989 
decided on 22.12.1989; M.L. Joseph v. SBI: O.P. No. 2/1989 decided on 31.8.1989). It has also been held by 
National Commission in the case of Mrs. Anumati v. Punjab National Bank (2003 CTJ 921 (CP) (NCDRC) 
that the financial institutions have every right to protect their interests by taking conscious decisions. There 
shall be no deficiency in service where the bank takes conscious decision to adjust the fixed deposit of the 
joint holders against the loan taken by a third party when the FDR has been mortgaged as guarantee for 
loan. 
Failure of a Housing Board to give possession of the flat after receiving the price and after registering it in 
favour of the allottee was held to be ‘deficiency in service’ in the case of Lucknow Development Authority 
v.Roop Kishore Tandon F.N. No. 54/1990 decided on 10.10.1990. 
Cancellation of train services by the railways due to disturbance involving violence so as to safeguard the 
passengers as well as its own property was held by the National Commission as not constituting ‘deficiency 
in service’ on the part of the Railway. [Dainik Rail Yatri Sangh (Regd.) v. The General Manager, 
NorthernRailway - I (1992) CPJ 218 (NC)]. Failure of the Railways to provide cushioned seats in the first 
class compartments as per specifications laid down by the Railway Board and to check unauthorised 
persons from entering and occupying first class compartments was held to be ‘deficiency’ [N. Prabhakaran v. 
GeneralManager, Southern Railway, Madras - I (1992) CPJ 323 (NC). 
In Union Bank of India v. Seppo Rally OY (1999) 35 CLA 203, the Supreme Court held that delay in payment 
of an unconditionally guaranteed amount by a bank in India to a non-resident in Finland in foreign currency 
can not be attributed to any deficiency in the service of the bank when the banks stand is that the delay is 
caused by the failure of a bank in Finland, to which the remittance was to have been made under the 
nonresidents instructions to reply to the Indian Banks valid query in this connection and the RBI took time to 
grant the necessary permission to make the remittance. 
CONSUMER PROTECTION COUNCILS 
The interests of consumers are sought to be promoted and protected under the Act inter alia by

Protection Council (hereinafter referred to as the Central Council), consisting of the Minister in charge of 
Consumer Affairs in the Central Government, as its Chairman, and such number of other official or non 
official members representing such interests as may be prescribed. However, the Consumer Protection 
Rules, 1987 restrict the number of members of the Central Council to 150 members. Section 5 of the Act 
requires the Central Council to meet as and when necessary, but atleast once in every year. The procedure 
in regard to transaction of its business at the meeting is given in Rule 4 of the Rules.

establishment in every district of a council to be known as the District Consumer Protection Council .It shall 
consist of the Collector of the district (by whatever name called), who shall be its Chairman and such number 
of other official and non-official members representing such interests as may be prescribed by the State 
Government. The District Council shall meet as and when necessary but not less than two meetings shall be 
held every year. The District Council shall meet at such time and place within the district as the Chairman 
may think fit and shall observe such procedure in regard to the transaction of its business as may be

District Forum 
Section 9 of the Act provides for the establishment of a District Forum by the State Government in 
eachdistrict of the State. However, the State Government may establish more than one District Forum in a 
district if it deems fit to do so. Section 10(1) provides that each District Forum shall consist of: 
 
(a) Person who is, or who has been, or is qualified to be, a District Judge, who shall be its President; 
 
(b) Two other members one of whom shall be a woman, who shall have the following qualifications, 
namely: 
 
i) be not less than thirty-five years of age, 
 
ii) possess a bachelor’s degree from a recognised university, 
 
iii) be persons of ability, integrity and standing, and have adequate knowledge and experience of at 
least ten years in dealing with problems relating to economics, law, commerce, accountancy, 
industry, public affairs or administration: 
Provided that a person shall be disqualified for appointment as a member if he— 
 
(a) has been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for an offence, which, in the opinion of theState 
Government involves moral turpitude; or 
 
(b) is an undischarged insolvent; or 
 
(c) is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a competent court; or 
 
(d) has been removed or dismissed from the service of the Government or a body corporate owned or 
controlled by the Government; or 
 
(e) has, in the opinion of the State Government, such financial or other interest as is likely to affect 
prejudicially the discharge by him of his functions as a member; or 
 
(f) has such other disqualification as may be prescribed by the State Government. 
Every member of the District Forum shall hold office for a term of 5 years or upto the age of 65 years, 
whichever is earlier, and shall be eligible for reappointment for another term of five years or upto the age of 
sixty-five years, whichever is earlier, subject to the condition that he fulfills the qualifications and other 
conditions for appointment mentioned in Section 10(1)(b) and such re-appointment is also made on the basis 
of the recommendation of the Selection Committee. A member may resign his office in writing under his hand 
addressed to the State Government. 
Jurisdiction of District Forum 
Section 11 provides for the jurisdiction of the District Forum under two criteria pecuniary and territorial. 
Pecuniary limits 
Section 11(1) empowers the District Forum to entertain complaints where the value of goods or services and 
the compensation, if any, claimed does not exceed rupees twenty lakhs. 
Territorial limits 
Section 11(2) requires a complaint to be instituted in the District Forum within the local limits of whose 
jurisdiction the opposite party or the defendant actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or has 
a branch office or personally works for gain, at the time of institution of the complaint; or any one of the 
opposite parties (where there are more than one) actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or 
                                                                         Lesson 13         Consumer Protection Act, 1986 
299 
has a branch office or personally works for gain, at the time of institution of the complaint, provided that the 
other opposite party/parties acquiesce in such institution or the permission of the Forum is obtained in 
respect of such opposite parties; or the cause of action arises, wholly or in part. 
In the case of Dynavox Electronic Pvt. Ltd. v. B.J.S. Rampuria Jain College, Bikaner (Appeal No. 4/89 before 
the Rajasthan CDRC), it was held that where in a contract, the machinery was supplied and installed at a 
particular place, a part of cause of action would be deemed to have arisen at that place, therefore, the 
complaint could be instituted in the District Forum within whose jurisdiction that place falls.  
State Commission 
Section 16 of the Act empowers the State Government to establish the State Consumer Disputes Redressal 
Commission consisting of: 
 
(a)  a person who is or has been a judge of a High Court appointed by the State Government (in 
consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court) who shall be its President. 
 
(b) not less than two and not more than such number of members, as may be prescribed, one of whom 
shall be a woman, who shall have the following qualifications, namely: 
 
(i)  be not less than thirty-five years of age, 
 
(ii) possess a bachelor’s degree from a recognised university, and 
 
(iii) be persons of ability, integrity and standing, and have adequate knowledge and experience of at 
least ten years in dealing with problems relating to economics, law, commerce, accountancy,  
industry, public affairs or administration: 
It is required that not more than fifty per cent of the members be from amongst persons having a judicial 
background. “Persons having judicial background” shall mean persons having knowledge and experience for 
at least a period of ten years as a presiding officer at the district level court or any tribunal at equivalent level. 
A person shall be disqualified for appointment as a member if he 
 
(a) has been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for an offence, which, in the opinion of the State 
Government involves moral turpitude; or 
 
(b) is an undischarged insolvent; or 
 
(c) is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a competent court; or 
 
(d) has been removed or dismissed from the service of the Government or a body corporate owned or 
controlled by the Government; or 
 
(e) has in the opinion of the State Government, such financial or other interest, as is likely to affect 
prejudicially the discharge by him of his functions as a member; or 
 
(f) has such other disqualification as may be prescribed by the State Government. 
Every appointment shall be made by the State Government on the recommendation of a Selection 
Committee consisting of the President of the State Commission, Secretary Law Department of the State and 
Secretary in charge of Consumer Affairs in the State. The proviso to this clause states that where the 
President of the State Commission is, by reason of absence or otherwise, unable to act as Chairman of the 
Selection Committee, the State Government may refer the matter to the Chief Justice of the High Court for 
nominating a sitting Judge of that High Court to act as Chairman. Section 16(2) empowers the State 
EP-EBCL 
300 
Government to decide on the salary or honorarium and other allowances payable to the members of the 
State Commission and the other terms and conditions of service. 
Every member of the State Commission shall hold office for a term of five years or upto the age of sixty 
seven years, whichever is earlier and shall be eligible for reappointment for another term of five years or upto 
the age of sixty-seven years, whichever is earlier, subject to the condition that he fulfills the qualifications and 
other conditions for appointment mentioned in Section 16(1)(b) and such re-appointment is made on the 
basis of the recommendation of the Selection Committee. 
Jurisdiction of State Commission 
Section 17 of the Act provides for the jurisdiction of the Commission as follows: 
 
(a) the State Commission can entertain complaints where the value of the goods or services and the 
compensation, if any claimed exceed rupees twenty lakhs but does not exceed rupees one crore; 
 
(b) the State Commission also has the jurisdiction to entertain appeals against the orders of any District 
Forum within the State. However, under second proviso to Section 15 no appeal by a person, who 
is required to pay any amount in terms of an order of the District Forum, shall be entertained by the 
State Commission unless the appellant has deposited in the prescribed manner fifty percent of the 
amount or rupees twenty-five thousand, whichever is less; 
 
(c) the State Commission also has the power to call for the records and pass appropriate orders in any 
consumer dispute which is pending before or has been decided by any District Forum within the 
State, if it appears to it that such District Forum has exercised any power not vested in it by law or 
has failed to exercise a power rightfully vested in it by law or has acted illegally or with material 
irregularity. 
A complaint shall be instituted in a State Commission within the limits of whose jurisdiction, - 
 
(a) the opposite party or each of the opposite parties, where there are more than one, at the time of the 
institution of the complaint, actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or has a branch 
office or personally works for gain; or 
 
(b) any of the opposite parties, where there are more than one, at the time of the institution of the 
complaint, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business or has a branch office or 
personally works for gain, provided that in such case either the permission of the State Commission 
is given or the opposite parties who do not reside or carry on business or have a branch office or 
personally work for gain, as the case may be, acquiesce in such institution; or 
 
(c) the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises 
The State Commission’s jurisdiction may be original, appellate or revisional. In respect of (c)above, the State 
Commission may reverse the orders passed by the District Forum on anyquestion of fact or law or correct 
any error of fact or of law made by the Forum. 
The National Commission in Indian Airlines v. Consumer Education and Research Society (1992) CPR 
4(NC) held that in respect of the original jurisdiction of the State Commission, Section 17 only prescribes 
pecuniary limits. No territorial limits have been fixed for the exercise of original jurisdiction under the Act 
though the provision contained in Section 11(2) of the Act apply mutatis mutandis in the matter of 
entertaining original complaints by the State Commission. The territorial jurisdiction of the State Commission 
therefore extends to the territorial limit of the State. In the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, the State 
Commission may entertain appeals only against the orders of any District Forum within the State. Similar 
condition also applies in respect of the State Commissions power to revise orders of the District Forums -
                                                                         Lesson 13         Consumer Protection Act, 1986 
301 
only orders of the District Forum within the State may be subject to revision by the State Commission. 
Transfer of Cases 
Section 17A empowers the State Commission on the application of the complainant or of its own motion to 
transfer, at any stage of the proceeding any complaint pending before the District Forum to another District 
Forum within the State if the interest of justice so requires. 
National Commission 
Section 9 empowers the Central Government to establish the National Consumer Disputes Redressal 
Commission, by notification in the Official Gazette. Section 20(1) provides that the National Commission 
shall consist of— 
 
(a) a person who is or has been a judge of the Supreme Court, to be appointed by the Central 
Government (in consultation with the Chief Justice of India), who shall be its President; 
 
(b) not less than four and not more than such number of members as may be prescribed one of whom 
shall be a woman, who shall have the following qualifications, namely:- 
 
(i) be not less than thrity-five years of age; 
 
(ii)  possess a bachelor’s degree from a recognized university; and 
 
(iii) be persons of ability, integrity and standing and have adequate knowledge and experience of at 
least ten years in dealing with problems relating to economics, law, commerce, accountancy, 
industry, public affairs or administration: 
Provided that not more than fifty percent of the members shall be from amongst the persons having judicial 
background. “Persons having judicial background” shall mean persons having knowledge and experience for 
at least a period of ten years as a presiding officer at the district level court or any tribunal at equivalent level: 
A person shall be disqualified for appointment if he- 
 
(a) has been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for an offence, which, in the opinion of the 
Central Government involves moral turpitude; or 
 
(b) is an undischarged insolvent; or 
 
(c) is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a competent court; or 
 
(d) has been removed or dismissed from the service of the Government or a body corporate owned or 
controlled by the Government; or 
 
(e) has in the opinion of the Central Government such financial or other interest as is likely to affect 
prejudicially the discharge by him of his functions as a member; or 
 
(f) has such other disqualification as may be prescribed by the Central Government 
Every appointment by the Central Government is required to be made on the recommendation of a Selection 
Committee consisting of a Judge of the Supreme Court to be nominated by the Chief Justice of India, the 
Secretary in the Department of Legal Affairs and the Secretary in charge of Consumer Affairs in the 
Government of India. Section 20(2) empowers the Central Government to fix the salary/ honorarium and 
other allowances payable to the members as well as the other terms and conditions of their service. Every 
member of the National Commission shall hold office for a term of five years or upto seventy years of age, 
whichever is earlier and shall be eligible for reappointment for another term of five years or upto the age of 
seventy years, whichever is earlier, subject to the condition that he fulfills the qualifications and other 
EP-EBCL 
302 
conditions for appointment mentioned in Section 20(1)(b) and such re-appointment is made on the basis of 
the recommendation of the Selection Committee. 
Jurisdiction of National Commission 
Section 21 provides that the National Commission shall have jurisdiction: 
 
(a) to entertain complaints where the value of the goods or services and the compensation, if any, 
claimed exceeds rupees one crore; 
 
(b) to entertain appeals against the orders of any State Commission. However, under second proviso to 
Section 19 no appeal by a person, who is required to pay any amount in terms of an order of the 
State Commission, shall be entertained by the National Commission unless the appellant has 
deposited in the prescribed manner fifty percent of the amount or rupees thirty-five thousands, 
whichever is less; and 
 
(c) to call for the records and pass appropriate orders in any consumer dispute which is pending 
before, or has been decided by any State Commission where it appears to the National Commission 
that such State Commission has exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it by law, or has failed to 
exercise a jurisdiction so vested, or has acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with 
material irregularity. 
Complaints before the District Forum and State Commission 
Section 12 provides that a complaint, in relation to any goods sold or delivered or agreed to be sold or 
delivered or any service provided or agreed to be provided may be filed with the District Forum by— 
 
(a) the consumer to whom such goods are sold or delivered or agreed to be sold or delivered or such 
service provided or agreed to be provided; 
 
(b) any recognised consumer association, whether the consumer to whom the goods sold or delivered 
or agreed to be sold or delivered or service provided or agreed to be provided, is a member of such 
association or not; or 
 
(c) one or more consumers, where there are numerous consumers having the same interest with the 
permission of the District Forum, on behalf of, or for the benefit of, all consumers so interested; or 
 
(d) the Central or the State Government as the case may be, either in its individual capacity or as a 
representative of interests of the consumers in general. 
Every complaint filed under this section is required to be accompanied with such amount of fee and payable 
in such manner as may be prescribed. On receipt of a complaint, the District Forum may, by order, allow the 
complaint to be proceeded with or rejected. However, a complaint shall not be rejected unless an opportunity 
of being heard has been given to the complainant. It is also to be noted that the admissibility of the complaint 
shall ordinarily be decided within twenty-one days from the date on which the complaint was received. Where 
a complaint is allowed to be proceeded, the District Forum may proceed with the complaint in the manner 
provided under this Act. Where a complaint has been admitted by the District Forum, it shall not be 
transferred to any other court or tribunal or any authority set up by or under any other law for the time being 
in force. 
The explanation defines the term ‘recognised consumer association’ as to mean any voluntary consumer 
association registered under the Companies Act, 1956 or any other law for the time being in force. 
Thus, in case the affected consumer is unable to file the complaint due to ignorance, illiteracy or poverty, any 
                                                                         Lesson 13         Consumer Protection Act, 1986 
303 
recognised consumer association may file the complaint. The rule of ‘privity of contract' or locus standi which 
permits only the aggrieved party to take action has very rightly been set aside in the spirit of public interest 
litigation. Section 13 states the procedure to be followed by the District Forum or the State Commission on 
receipt of a complaint. On receipt of a complaint, a copy of the complaint is to be referred to the opposite 
party (or each of the opposite parties, where there are more than one) within twenty-one days from the date 
of its admission, directing him to give his version of the case within a period of 30 days. This period may be 
extended by another period of 15 days. If the opposite party admits the allegations contained in the 
complaint, the complaint will be decided on the basis of materials on the record. Where the opposite party 
denies or disputes the allegations contained in the complaint, or omits or fails to take any action to represent 
his case within the stipulated time, the dispute will be settled in the following manner: 
(i) In case of dispute relating to any goods 
Where the complaint alleges a defect in the goods which cannot be determined without proper analysis or 
test of the goods, a sample of the goods shall be obtained from the complainant, sealed and authenticated in 
the prescribed manner, for referring to the appropriate laboratory for the purpose of any analysis or test 
whichever may be necessary, so as to find out whether such goods suffer from any such defect. The 
‘appropriate laboratory’ would be required to report its finding to the referring authority, i.e. the District Forum 
or the State Commission within a period of forty-five days from the receipt of the reference or within such 
extended period as may be granted by these agencies [Section 13(1)(c)]. 
The term ‘Appropriate laboratory’ has been defined to mean a laboratory or organisation recognised by the 
Central Government or a State Government, subject to such guidelines as may be prescribed by the Central 
Government in this behalf; or any such laboratory or organisation established by or under any law for the 
time being in force, which is maintained, financed or aided by the Central Government or a State 
Government for carrying out analysis or test of any goods with a view to determining whether such goods 
suffer from any defect. 
Section 13 empowers the District Forum/State Commission to require the complainant to deposit such 
amount as may be specified, towards payment of fees to the ‘appropriate laboratory for the purpose of 
carrying out the necessary analysis or tests. The amount so deposited shall be remitted to the appropriate 
laboratory to enable it to carry out the analysis and send the report. On receipt of the report, a copy thereof is 
to be sent by District Forum/State Commission to the opposite party along with its own remarks. In case any 
of the parties i.e. opposite party or the complainant, disputes the correctness of the methods of analysis/test 
adopted by the appropriate laboratory, the concerned party will be required to submit his objections in writing 
in regard to the report. 
After giving both the parties a reasonable opportunity of being heard and to present their objections, if any, 
the District Forum/State Commission shall pass appropriate orders under Section 14 of the Act. 
(ii) In case of dispute relating to goods not requiring testing or analysis or relating to services Section 
13(2)(b) provides that where the opposite party denies or disputes the allegations contained in the complaint 
within the time given by the District/State Commission, the Agency concerned shall dispose of the complaint 
on the basis of evidence tendered by the parties. In case of failure by the opposite party to represent his 
case within the prescribed time, the complaint shall be disposed of on the basis of evidence tendered by the 
complainant. 
Limitation Period for Filing of Complaintl 
Section 24A provides that the District Forum, the State Commission, or the National Commission shall not 
admit a complaint unless it is filed within two years from the date on which the cause of action has arisen. 
EP-EBCL 
304 
However, where the complainant satisfies the Forum/Commission as the case may be, that he had sufficient 
cause for not filing the complaint within two years, such complaint may be entertained by it after recording 
the reasons for condoning the delay. 
Administrative Control 
Section 24B authorises the National Commission to exercise administrative control over the State 
Commissions in the matter of calling for periodical returns regarding the institution, pendency and disposal of 
cases, issuance of instructions regarding adopting of uniform procedure in hearing of matters, serving copies 
of documents, translation of judgements etc. and generally overseeing the functioning of the State 
Commission/District forum  to ensure that the objects and purposes of the Act are served in the best possible 
manner. 
Similarly, the State Commission has been authorised to exercise administrative control over all the District 
forum within its jurisdiction in all the above matters. 
Powers of the Redressal Agencies 
The District Forum, State Commission and the National Commission have been vested with the powers of a 
civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 while trying a suit in respect of the following matters: 
 
(i) the summoning and enforcing attendance of any defendant or witness and examining the witness 
on oath; 
 
(ii) the discovery and production of any document or other material object producible as evidence; 
 
(iii) the reception of evidence on affidavits; 
 
(iv) the requisitioning of the report of the concerned analysis or test from the appropriate laboratory or 
from any other relevant source; 
 
(v) issuing of any commission for the examination of any witness; and 
 
(vi) any other matter which may be prescribed. 
Under the Consumer Protection Rules, 1987, the District Forum, the State Commission and the National 
Commission have the power to require any person: 
 
(i) to produce before and allow to be examined by an officer of any of these agencies, such books of 
accounts, documents or commodities as may be required and to keep such book, documents etc. 
under his custody for the purposes of the Act; 
 
(ii) to furnish such information which may be required for the purposes of the Act to any officer so 
specified. 
These redressal agencies have also been empowered to pass written orders authorising any officer to 
exercise the power of entry and search of any premises where the books, papers, commodities or 
documents are kept if there is any ground to believe that these may be destroyed, mutilated, altered, falsified 
or secreted. Such authorised officer may also seize books, papers, documents or commodities if they are 
required for the purposes of the Act, provided the seizure is communicated to the District Forum/State 
Commission/National Commission within 72 hours. On examination of such documents or commodities, the 
agency concerned may order the retention thereof or may return it to the party concerned. 
The District forum, the State Commission and the National Commission have the power to issue remedial 
orders to the opposite party directing him to do any one or more of the things referred to in Section14(1)(a) to 
                                                                         Lesson 13         Consumer Protection Act, 1986 
305 
(i) as discussed herein below. The redressal agencies have also been empowered to dismiss frivolous and 
vexatious complaints under Section 26 of the Act and to order the complainant to make payment of costs, 
not exceeding `10,000 to the opposite party. 
 
COMPLAINTS TO BE REGISTERED 
District Consumer Forum 
for a claim of compensation up to `20 lakhs 
State Commission 
for a claim of compensation above `20 lakhs and 
up to `1 crore 
National Commission 
for a claim of compensation above Rs.1 crore 
Nature and Scope of Remedies under the Act 
In terms of Section 14(1) of the Act, where the goods complained against suffer from any of the 
defects specified in the complaint or any of the allegations contained in the complaint about the 
services are proved, the District Forum/State Commission/National Commission may pass one or 
more of the following orders: 
 
(a) to remove the defects pointed out by the appropriate laboratory from the goods in question; 
 
(b) to replace the goods with new goods of similar description which shall be free from any defect; 
 
(c) to return to the complainant the price, or, as the case may be, the charges paid by the complainant; 
 
(d) to pay such amount as may be awarded by it as compensation to the consumer for any loss or 
injury suffered by the consumer due to the negligence of the opposite party; 
 
(e) to remove the defects in goods or deficiencies in the services in question; 
 
(f) to discontinue the unfair trade practice or the restrictive trade practice or not to repeat them; 
 
(g) not to offer the hazardous goods for sale; 
    (h)   to withdraw the hazardous goods from being offered for sale; 
 (ha) to cease manufacture of hazardous goods and to desist from offering services which are hazardous 
in nature; 
 (hb) to pay such sum as may be determined by it if it is of the opinion that loss or injury has been 
suffered by a large number of consumers who are not identifiable conveniently: 
It is to be noted that the minimum amount of sum so payable shall not be less than five percent of the 
value of such defective goods sold or service provided, as the case may be, to such consumers. 
Further, the amount so obtained shall be credited in favour of such person and utilized in such manner 
as may be prescribed. 
 (hc) to issue corrective advertisement to neutralize the effect of misleading advertisement at the cost of 
the opposite party responsible for issuing such misleading advertisement; 
 
(i) to provide for adequate costs to parties. 
The remedies that can be granted by the redressal agencies are therefore, wide enough to cover removal of 
defects/deficiency in goods/services, replacing defective goods with new goods, refunding price/charges paid 
by the complainant, payment of compensation for loss or damage suffered, providing costs to parties and 
EP-EBCL 
306 
issuing prohibitory orders directing the discontinuance of unfair trade practice, sale of hazardous goods etc. 
However, the redressal agencies have not been granted power to order injunctions. Section 14(1)(d) 
provides that the redressal agency may order payment of compensation only in the event of negligence of 
the opposite party which resulted in loss or damage and not otherwise, i.e. even though the complainant has 
suffered loss or damage, he may not be entitled for compensation if he cannot prove negligence. 
Appeal 
Section 15 entitles a person aggrieved by an order of the District Forum to prefer an appeal to the State 
Commission. Similarly any person aggrieved by any original order of the State Commission may prefer an 
appeal to the National Commission under Section 19. Likewise, any person aggrieved by any original order 
of the National Commission may prefer an appeal to the Supreme Court, under Section 23. 
All such appeals are to be made within thirty days from the date of the order. However, the concerned 
Appellate authority may entertain an appeal after the said period of thirty days if it is satisfied that there was 
sufficient cause for not filling it within the prescribed period. The period of 30 days would be computed from 
the date of receipt of the order by the appellant. 
It may be noted that no appeal by a person, who is required to pay any amount in terms of an order of the 
District Forum/State Commission, shall be entertained by the State Commission/National Commission 
respectively unless the appellant has deposited in the prescribed manner fifty percent of that amount or 
twenty five thousand rupees/thirty-five thousand respectively, whichever is less. It may be observed that 
appeals are allowable only against the original orders passed by the concerned redressal agency. Appellate 
orders passed by the State Commission or National Commission (i.e. on appeal against the orders of the 
District Forum or State Commission) cannot be further appealed against though on questions of law revision 
petitions may be filed. So also, the revisional orders passed by the State Commission or the National 
Commission are not appealable. 
APPEAL 
Aggrieved by the orders issued by the District Consumer Redressal Forum, appeal petition may be filed 
before State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission within 30 days from the date of receipt of orders. 
Aggrieved by the orders issued by the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, appeal petition may 
be filed before National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission within 30 days from the date of receipt of 
orders. 
Aggrieved by the orders issued by the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, appeal petition 
may be filed before Supreme Court of India within 30 days from the date of receipt of orders 
Penalties 
Section 27 of the Act deals with penalties and provides that failure or omission by a trader or other person 
against whom a complaint is made or the complainant to comply with any order of the District Forum, State 
Commission or the National Commission shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be 
less than one month but which may extend to three years, or with fine of not less than Rs. 2,000 but which 
may extend to Rs. 10,000, or with both. 
However, on being satisfied that the circumstances of any case so require, the District Forum or the State 
Commission or the National Commission may impose a lesser fine or a shorter term of imprisonment. 
Section 27(3) prescribes that all offences under the Act to be tried summarily.

GIST OF IMPORTANT CONSUMER CASES 
Gist of some of the important rulings rendered by Supreme Court, National Commission and State 
Commissions, are given hereunder: 
Failure to provide basic safeguards in the swimming pool – deficiency in service 
In the case of Sashikant Krishnaji Dole v. Shitshan Prasarak Mandali [F.A. No. 134 of 1993 decided on 
27.9.1995 (NCDRC)] the school owned a swimming pool and offered swimming facilities to the public on 
payment of a fee. The school conducted winter and summer training camps to train boys in swimming and 
for this purpose engaged a trainer/coach. The complainants had enrolled their son for learning swimming 
under the guidance of the coach. It was alleged that due to the negligence of the coach the boy was drowned 
and met with his death. The school denied that it had engaged the services of a coach and also denied any 
responsibility on its part. The coach claimed that he was a person with considerable experience in coaching 
young boys in swimming and that as in other cases he taught the deceased boy also the way in which he 
should swim and take all precautions while swimming. When the deceased was found to have been drowned 
the coach immediately took him out of the water and removed the water from his stomach and gave him 
artificial respiration and thereafter took him to a doctor, where he died. 
The State Commission held the school and the coach deficient in rendering service to the deceased, that the 
coach was not fully trained, did not exercise even the basic commonsense needed to counter an accident in 
swimming. He was so casual in his behaviour that he did not attempt to take prompt action to save the life of 
the deceased and so far as the school was concerned it did not even provide basic facilities nor did it provide 
any safeguards to prevent accidents. 
Dismissing the appeal the National Commission observed that the State Commission had given cogent 
reasons for holding the school and the coach responsible for death of the deceased. A detailed examination 
of the depositions of eye witnesses showed that the Commission had correctly appreciated the evidence and 
come to the conclusion that the coach was negligent and the school did not provide the necessary life saving 
mechanism to save the lives of trainee students in cases of accidents. 
So far as the compensation was concerned the State Commission had taken all relevant factors into 
accountand fixed the amount at Rs. 1.50 lakhs which was reasonable. 
Removal of ladder of an aircraft while disembarking by the passenger— deficiency inservice 
In Station Manager, Indian Airlines v. Dr. Jiteswar Ahir [First Appeal No. 270 of 1994 decided on 28.2.1996 
(NCDRC)] when the complainant-passenger occupied his seat in the aircraft, an announcement was made 
that his luggage was lying on the ground unidentified and that he should disembark to identify his luggage. 
According to the complainant he moved towards the rear door, and finding that the step ladder was attached 
to the aircraft door, he stepped out on to the staircase but before he could actually put his entire body weight 
on the staircase the ladder was suddenly removed as a result of which he fell down on the ground and 
sustained bodily injuries which was reported to be about 10 percent. As against the complainant’s claim of 
`10 lakhs the airlines was willing to pay `40,000 as compensation which according to them was the 
maximum statutory liability of the Corporation under the Carriage by Air Act, 1972. 
The State Commission, after examining witnesses and the medical boards report held that there was 
dangerous deficiency in service and having regard to the expert opinion and other medical reports, it ordered 
payment of compensation of `4 lakhs and `1 lakh for mental agony and distress plus costs. 
In appeal by the Corporation, the National Commission, upholding the State Commissions order, held that in 
terms of regulations relied upon by the appellant Corporation, if it was proved that the accident caused to the 
EP-EBCL 
308 
complainant had resulted in a permanent disablement, incapacitating him from engaging in or being 
occupied with his usual duties or his business or occupation, the liability could not exceed Rs. 5 lakhs. This 
case related to the incapacity and permanent disability to the extent of 10 per cent and, therefore, the 
compensation could not exceed Rs. 5 lakhs. The State Commissions assessment of compensation of Rs. 4 
lakhs was justified, considering the age of the complainant (37 years) at the time of accident and his having 
lost earning capacity. The State Commission was also right in awarding compensation of rupees one lakh for 
the complainants mental suffering and agony as well as feeling of inferiority in social relations. Deficiency in 
service cannot be alleged without attributing fault, imperfection, shortcoming or in adequacy in the quality, 
nature and manner of performance which is required to be performed by a person in pursuance of a contract 
or otherwise in relation to any service. The burden of proving deficiency in service is upon the person who 
alleged it. When the complainant has not established any willful fault, imperfection, shortcoming or 
inadequacy in the service of the respondent, there can be no deficiency in service. 
In Ravneet Singh Bagga v. KLM Royal Dutch Fintimes [1999(7) SCALE 43], the complainant booked a ticked 
from Delhi to New York by a KLM plane. The airport authorities in New Delhi did not find any fault in his visa 
and other documents. However at Amsterdam, the airport authorities instituted proceedings of verification 
because of which the appellant missed his flight to New York. After reaching New York, the airlines tendered 
apology to the appellant for the inconvenience and paid as a goodwill gesture a sum of Rs. 2,500. The 
appellant made a complaint to the National Commission under the Consumer Protection Act which was 
rejected. 
The Supreme Court held that the respondent could not be held to be guilty of deficiency in service. The staff 
of the airline acted fairly and in a bona fide manner, keeping in mind security and safety of passengers and 
the Aircraft. The photograph on visa documents was a photo copy and not the original which was unusual. In 
the circumstances, the staff took some time to ascertain the truth and helped the appellant to reach New 
York the same day. 
A doctor qualified to practice homoeopathic system of medicines treating a patient with 
allopathic medicines and patient dies - guilty of negligence 
In Poonam Verma v. Ashwin Patel [1996(4) SCALE 364] the respondent was a qualified medical practitioner 
in homoeopathic system of medicine. The appellant, was the widow of a person who, it was alleged, had 
died because of the negligence of the respondent in administering allopathic medicines in which he was not 
qualified to practise. It was alleged that the deceased was treated to begin with, for viral fever on allopathic 
medicines and since his condition had not improved antibiotics were used without conducting proper tests. 
When his condition further deteriorated he was removed to a nursing home and after four days he was 
removed to a hospital in an unconscious state. Within a few hours thereafter he died. 
Her complaint to the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission for damages for the negligence 
and carelessness of respondent in treating her husband was dismissed. Allowing the appeal the Supreme 
Court held that the respondent who had practised in allopathy without being qualified in that system was 
guilty of negligence per se. A person is liable at law for the consequences of his negligence. Jurisdiction of 
the Commission: The Supreme Court observed that it is beyond doubt now that disputes regarding 
applicability of the Act to persons engaged in medical profession either as private practitioners or as 
Government doctors working in hospitals or Government dispensaries come within the purview of the 
Consumer Protection Act, 1986. It is also settled that a patient who is a consumer has to be awarded 
compensation for loss or injury suffered by him due to negligence of the doctor by applying the same tests as 
are applied in an action for damages for negligence. 
In Gopi Ram Goyal and others v. National Heart Institute and others, 2001 CTJ 405 (CP) (NCDRC), the 
                                                                         Lesson 13         Consumer Protection Act, 1986 
309 
National Commission held that where the record and evidence shows that the conduct of the opposite parties 
i.e. doctors was more than reasonable and the level of care was as could be expected from professional in 
exercising reasonable degree of skill and knowledge. The complainant however failed to prove any case of 
negligence on the part of doctors, therefore the doctor cannot be held liable for death of patient. 
Fall from a running train while passing through vestibule passage – deficiency in service 
In Union of India v. Nathmal Hansaria [First Appeal No. 692 of 1993 decided on 24.1.1997 (NCDRC)] the 
daughter of the respondent, travelling by a train, fell down from the running train while she was passing 
through the inter-connecting passage between two compartments and died as a result of crush injuries on 
her head. In the respondents petition for compensation, the Railways contended that the Consumer 
Redressal agencies had no jurisdiction to consider a complaint of this nature in view of Section 15 of the 
Railway Claims Tribunal Act read with Section 13 of that Act. 
The State Commission held that a railway passenger travelling in a train on payment of consideration was a 
consumer within the meaning of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Section 82A of the Railways Act 
referred to in Section 13 of the Railway Claims Tribunal Act, 1987 and the rules made thereunder provided 
compensation for railway accidents and not for accidental death of this nature. 
Dismissing the appeal the National Commission held that the death of the passenger could not be described 
as resulting from railway accident but an accidental death caused by the absence of safety devices in the 
vestibule passage way. 
Although the railway administration had claimed that the coach was a new coach and that all coaches had 
been thoroughly checked at the starting point of the train and that no defect was reported, the railways had 
not contended that this particular coach was checked at the time of commencement of the journey. The 
general statement of practice and procedure was not conclusive proof that this particular coach was checked 
and no evidence had been produced in support of their contention. Thus, the State Commission was right in 
holding that the deceased passenger was a consumer. On the basis of similar facts, the MRTP Commission 
has recently awarded a compensation of Rs. 18 lakhs with 9% interest to the parents of deceased. The 
above compensation appears to be the highest award in commission’s history. 
Repudiation of Insurance claim because the driver did not have a valid license 
In the case of Jitendra Kumar v. Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. and another the Supreme Court has held 
that where the fire has occurred due to mechanical failure and not due to any act or omission of the driver, 
the insurance company cannot repudiate the claim because of lack of valid driving license. 
Premium paid to the agent of the LIC but the agent did not deposit the premium, death of 
the insured - No deficiency of service on the part of the LIC 
In Harshad J. Shah v. Life Insurance Corporation of India [1997(3) SCALE 423 (SC)] the insured (since 
deceased) took out four life policies with double accident benefits, premium payable half-yearly. When the 
third premium fell due, the general agent of the Corporation met the person and took a bearer cheque 
towards the premium payable by him in respect of the policies. Although the cheque was encashed 
immediately thereafter, it was not deposited with the Corporation for another three months. In the meantime, 
the insured met with a fatal accident and died. The Corporation rejected the widows claim for payment of the 
sum assured on the ground that the policies had lapsed for non-payment of premium within the grace period. 
In the widows complaint to the State Commission under the Consumer Protection Act the Corporation 
pleaded that the amount of premium allegedly collected by the general agent could not be said to have been 
EP-EBCL 
310 
received by the Corporation, that the agent was not authorised to collect the premium amount. The State 
Commission held that in order to collect more business, agents of the Corporation collected premiums from 
policyholders either in cash or by cheque and then deposited the money so collected with the Corporation 
and that this practice had been going on directly within the knowledge of the Corporations administration, 
notwithstanding the departmental instructions that the agent was not authorised to collect the premiums. 
When the practice of the agent collecting the premiums from policyholders was in existence and the money 
was collected by the agent in his capacity and authority, the reasonable inference was that the Corporation 
was negligent in its service towards the policyholder. 
The National Commission, in appeal, was of the view that the insurance agent in receiving a bearer cheque 
from the insured towards payment of insurance premium was not acting as agent of the Corporation nor 
could it be said that the Corporation had received the premium on the date the bearer cheque was received 
by the agent, even though he deposited the sum with the Corporation a day after the death of the insured. 
Dismissing the appeal the Supreme Court held that the agent had no express authority to receive the 
premium on behalf of the Corporation. In his letter of appointment there was a condition expressly prohibiting 
him from collecting the premium. Nor could it be said that he had an implied authority to collect the premium, 
as regulation 8(4) expressly prohibited the agents from collecting premiums. Therefore, no case had been 
set up by the complainant before the State Commission that the Corporation by its conduct had induced the 
policyholders, including the insured, to believe that the agents were authorised to receive premiums on 
behalf of the Corporation. Nor was there any material on record that lent support to this contention. In the 
facts of this case there was no room to invoke the doctrine of apparent authority underlying Section 237 of 
the Indian Contract Act. 
In National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Seema Malhotra [2001(2) SCALE 140] (Supreme Court) a cheque was 
issued under a contract of insurance of motor car by the insured for payment of premium to the policy. 
However, cheque was dishonoured for want of funds in the account. Meanwhile, the car met with an accident 
and badly damaged, killing the insured owner. The claim for insured amount was repudiated by the company. 
The Supreme Court held that applying the principles envisaged under Section 51, 52 and 54 of Indian 
Contract Act, relating to reciprocal promises, insurer need not to perform his part of promise when the other 
party fails to perform his part and thus not liable to pay the insured amount. 
Educational Institutions 
In Sreedharan Nair N. v. Registrar, University of Kerala [2001 CTJ 561 (CP) (NCDRC)], the University 
refused to provide LL.B. degree certificate on completion of course on the ground that the qualifying 
examination on the basis of which student was admitted in LL.B. course in Kerala law college has not been 
recognised by it. The National Commission held that this is a clear case of deficiency on part of University. A 
compensation of Rs. 50,000 was awarded to complainant. 
In Isabella Thoburn College v. Ms. Fatima Effendi [2001 CTJ 386 (CP) (SCDRC)], the State Commission 
held that non-refund of admission fee is not a deficiency of service on the part of the university because 
admission fee is consideration for admission and respondent herself voluntarily withdrawing admission from 
one university to join another institute cannot claim refund of admission fee. 
Medical Negligence 
In Kusum Sharma & Others Versus Batra Hospital & Medical Research Centre & Others 2010 CTJ 242 
Supreme Court (CP) Supreme Court held that while deciding whether the medical professional is guilty of 
                                                                         Lesson 13         Consumer Protection Act, 1986 
311 
medical negligence following well known principles must be kept in view:- 
 
I. Negligence is the breach of a duty exercised by omission to do something which a reasonable man, 
guided by those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or 
doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do. 
 
II. Negligence is an essential ingredient of the offence. The negligence to be established by the 
prosecution must be culpable or gross and not the negligence merely based upon an error of 
judgment. 
 
III. The medical professional is expected to bring a reasonable degree of skill and knowledge and must 
exercise a reasonable degree of care. Neither the very highest nor a very low degree of care and 
competence judged in the light of the particular circumstances of each case is what the law 
requires. 
 
IV. A medical practitioner would be liable only where his conduct fell below that of the standards of a 
reasonably competent practitioner in his field. 
 
V. In the realm of diagnosis and treatment there is scope for genuine difference of opinion and one 
professional doctor is clearly not negligent merely because his conclusion differs from that of other 
professional doctor. 
 
VI. The medical professional is often called upon to adopt a procedure which involves higher element of 
risk, but which he honestly believes as providing greater chances of success for the patient rather 
than a procedure involving lesser risk but higher chances of failure. Just because a professional 
looking to the gravity of illness has taken higher element of risk to redeem the patient out of his/her 
suffering which did not yield the desired result may not amount to negligence. 
 VII. Negligence cannot be attributed to a doctor so long as he performs his duties with reasonable skill 
and competence. Merely because the doctor chooses one course of action in preference to the 
other one available, he would not be liable if the course of action chosen by him was acceptable to 
the medical profession. 
 VIII. It would not be conducive to the efficiency of the medical profession if no Doctor could administer 
medicine without a halter round his neck. 
 
IX. It is our bounden duty and obligation of the civil society to ensure that the medical professionals are 
not unnecessary harassed or humiliated so that they can perform their professional duties without 
fear and apprehension. 
 
X. The medical practitioners at times also have to be saved from such a class of complainants who 
use criminal process as a tool for pressurizing the medical professionals/hospitals particularly 
private hospitals or clinics for extracting uncalled for compensation. Such malicious proceedings 
deserve to be discarded against the medical practitioners. 
 
XI. The medical professionals are entitled to get protection so long as they perform their duties with 
reasonable skill and competence and in the interest of the patients. The interest and welfare of the 
patients have to be paramount for the medical professionals. 
The aforementioned principles must be kept in view while deciding the cases of medical negligence. We 
should not be understood to have held that doctors can never be prosecuted for medical negligence. As long 
as the doctors have performed their duties and exercised an ordinary degree of professional skill and 
competence, they cannot be held guilty of medical negligence. It is imperative that the doctors must be able 
to perform their professional duties with free mind.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
The Essential Commodities Act, 1955 was enacted 
to ensure easy availability of essential commodities 
to the consumers and to protect them from 
exploitation by unscrupulous traders. The Act 
provides for regulation and control of production, 
distribution and pricing of commodities, which are 
declared as essential for maintaining or increasing 
supplies or for securing their equitable distribution 
and availability at fair prices.  
The Essential Commodities Act is being implemented 
by the State Governments/UT Administrations by 
availing of the delegated powers under the Act. The 
State Governments/ UT Administrations have issued 
various Control Orders for regulation, production and 
distribution of Essential Commodities such as food 
grains, edible oils, pulses kerosene, sugar etc. The 
Central Government regularly monitors the action 
taken by State Governments/UT Administrations to 
implement 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
Essential 
Commodities Act, 1955.  
The items declared as essential commodities under 
the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 are reviewed 
from time to time in the light of liberalized economic 
policies 
in 
consultation 
with 
the 
Ministries/ 
Departments 
administering 
the 
essential 
commodities and particularly with regard to their 
production, demand, and supply. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
The preamble to the Act says that it is an Act to provide in the Interest of the general Public for the control of 
production, supply and distribution of, and trade and commerce in, certain commodities. 
LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL 
316 
INTRODUCTION 
In 1939 the Government of India made certain rules to control the production, supply and distribution of 
certain commodities under the Defence of India Act which ceased to have force in September, 1946. It was 
however considered necessary that control in respect of certain commodities essential for human beings 
should continue in the interest of the general public. Therefore, the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) 
Ordinance, XVIII of 1946 was promulgated by which certain provisions of the Defence of India Rules 
continued to have force. This Ordinance was subsequently replaced by the Essential Supplies (Temporary 
Powers) Act, 1946 (Act No. XXIV of 1946). 
The operation of the Act was prolonged upto 1st April, 1948, by virtue of a Notification published in the 
Gazette of India, dated March 8, 1947. Under certain resolution of the Constituent Assembly passed in 1948 
and 1949 and by the Adaptation of Laws Act, 1950, the operation of the Act was further extended to different 
periods from time to time. 
Since in public interest it was considered necessary that the Centre should continue to control production, 
supply and distribution of certain essential commodities, the need for a permanent measure on the subject 
was felt. For this purpose, certain amendments were required to be made in the Constitution. The 
Constitution (Third Amendment) Act made the required amendments in Entry 33 of List 3 of the Seventh 
Schedule to the Constitution to enable the Parliament to enact the required legislation. The Essential 
Commodities Ordinance No. 1 of 1955, was therefore, promulgated which came into force on 26th January, 
1955. This Ordinance was subsequently replaced by the present Act namely, the Essential Commodities Act, 
1955 (Act No. 1 of 1955) w.e.f 1st April, 1955. 
OBJECT AND SCOPE OF THE ACT 
The Preamble to the Act says that it is an Act to provide in the interest of the general 
public for the control of the production, supply and distribution of, and trade and 
commerce in, certain commodities. The dominant object and intendment of the Act is 
to secure equitable distribution and availability at fair prices of essential commodities 
in the interest of the general public. The interest of the general public necessarily connotes the 
interest of the consuming public and not the interest of the dealer (1958 Andh. LT587). 
DEFINITIONS (SECTION 2) 
The Act contains definitions of five important terms, namely: 
Collector 
“Collector” includes an Additional Collector, and such other officer not below the rank of Sub-Divisional 
Officer as may be authorised to perform the functions and exercise the powers of the Collector under the Act 
[Section 2(ia)]. 
Essential Commodities 
Section 2A dealing with Essential commodities declaration, etc. defines the "essential commodity" as to 
mean a commodity specified in the Schedule. 
 
                                                                         Lesson 14         Essential Commodities Act, 1955 317 
Schedule to the Act lists out following commodities: 
 
 
 
(1) drugs: The explanation clarifies that for the purposes of this Schedule, "drugs" has the meaning 
assigned to it in clause (b) of Section 3 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 (23 of 1940); 
 
(2) fertilizer, whether inorganic, organic or mixed; 
 
(3) foodstuffs, including edible oilseeds and oils; 
 
(4) hank yarn made wholly from cotton; 
 
(5) petroleum and petroleum products; 
 
(6) raw jute and jute textiles; 
 
(7)   (i) seeds of food-crops and seeds of fruits and vegetables; 
 
(ii) seeds of cattle fodder; and 
 
(iii) jute seeds. 
Sub-section (2) empowers the Central Government to amend, if it is satisfied that it is necessary so to do in 
the public interest and for reasons to be specified in the notification published in the Official Gazette, the 
Schedule so as to (a) add a commodity to the said Schedule; and (b) remove any commodity from the said 
Schedule, in consultation with the State Governments. 
In terms of Sub-section (3) any notification issued under Sub-section (2) may also direct that an entry shall 
be made against such commodity in the said Schedule declaring that such commodity shall be deemed to be 
an essential commodity for such period not exceeding six months to be specified in the notification. However, 
Central Government may, in the public interest and for reasons to be specified, by notification in the Official 
Gazette, extend such period beyond the said six months. 
The Central Government may exercise its powers under Sub-section (2) in respect of the commodity to 
which Parliament has power to make laws by virtue of Entry 33 in List III in the Seventh Schedule to the 
Constitution. Every notification issued under sub-section (2) is required to be laid, as soon as may be after it 
is issued, before both Houses of Parliament. 
In addition to the items included in the list given in the said clause, such other items which may be so 
declared by the Central Government by notified orders would also be included in the list of essential 
commodities, but in any case, such commodities would not be outside the scope of Entry 33 in List III in the 
Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. The Central Government has time and again, notified various 
commodities to be essential commodities. The term ‘essential commodities’ is defined in Rule 35(3) of the 
Defence of India Rules, 1962, to mean “food, water, fuel, light, power or any other thing notified by the 
Central Government in this behalf as essential for the existence of the community”. Of course, the definition 
in the Essential Commodities Act is more comprehensive than that in the Defence of India Rules, but both 
definitions enumerate certain things or articles and have scope for addition to the list of other articles notified 
in that behalf by the Central Government. As such, the articles not expressly mentioned in the definition 
given in the Defence of India Rules, can become essential commodities within the meaning of the expression 
used in the Rules by a simple government notification and the slight difference in the definition of essential 
commodity in the Act from that given in the Rules does not make one repugnant to the other [Nathuni Lai 
Gupta v. The State (1964 Cr. LJ 662)]. 
 
EP-EBCL 
318 
IN S. Samuel, MD. Harrisons Malayava v. Union of India, AIR 2004 SC 218, 
Supreme Court held that Tea is not foodstuff. Even in a wider sense, foodstuffs 
will not include tea as tea either in the form of the leaves or in the form of 
beverage, does not go into the preparation of food proper to make it more 
palatable and digestible. Tea leaves are not eaten. Tea is a beverage produced 
by steeping tea leaves or buds of the tea plants in the boiled water. Such tea is consumed hot or 
cold for its flavour, taste and its quality as a stimulant. The stimulating effect is caused by the 
presence of caffeine therein. Tea neither nourishes the body nor sustains nor promotes its growth. 
It does not have any nutritional value. It does not help formation of enzymes nor does it enable 
anabolism. Tea or its beverage does not go into the preparation of any foodstuff. In common 
parlance, any one who has taken tea would not say that he has taken or eaten food. Thus tea is not 
a food. 
Order: “Order” includes a direction issued thereunder [Section 2(c)]. 
State Government: “State Government”, in relation to a Union territory means the administrator of such 
territory [Section 2(d)]. 
Sugar: “Sugar” means: (i) any form of sugar containing more than 90 per cent of sucrose, including sugar 
candy; (ii) Khandsari sugar or bura sugar or crushedsugar, or any sugar in crystalline or powdered form; or 
(iii) sugar in process in vacuum pan sugar factory, or raw sugar [Section 2(e)]. 
Authorities responsible to administer the Act 
Necessary powers have been given to the Central Government under the Act to administer the provisions of 
the Act by issuing orders/directions notified in the official gazette and by delegating the authority to State 
Governments and administrators of Union Territories. The Central Government at its apex level is 
responsible for achieving the objectives enshrined by the Parliament under this Act for the welfare and 
general well-being of all the citizens. 
Powers of Central Government to control production, supply and distribution etc., of essential 
commodities [Section 3] 
 
Power to Issue Orders 
The Central Government having been vested with power under Section 3(1) can issue 
order in the following circumstances providing for regulating or prohibiting the 
production, supply and distribution of essential commodities and trade and commerce

(c) for controlling the price at which any essential commodity may be bought or sold.  
 
(d) for regulating by licences, permits or otherwise the storage, transport, distribution, disposal,

(e) for prohibiting the withholding from sale of any essential commodity ordinarily kept for sale;  
 
(f) for requiring any person holding in stock, or engaged in the production, or in the business of buying 
or selling, of any essential commodity—(a) to sell the whole or a specified part of the quantity held 
in stock or produced or received by him, or (b) in the case of any such commodity which is likely to 
be produced or received by him, to sell the whole or a specified part of such commodity when 
produced or received by him, to the Central Government or a State Government or to an officer or 
agent of such Government or to a Corporation owned or controlled by such Government or to such 
other person or class of persons and in such circumstances as may be specified in the order. 
 
 Explanation I provides that an order made under this clause in relation to foodgrains, edible oilseeds 
or edible oils may, having regard to the estimated production, In the concerned area, of such 
foodgrains, edible oilseeds and edible oils, fix the quantity to be sold by the producers in such area 
and may also fix, or provide for the fixation of such quantity on a graded basis, having regard to the 
aggregate of the area held by, or under the cultivation of the producers. 
 
 Explanation II provides that “production” for the purposes of this clause includes manufacture of 
edible oils and sugar with its grammatical variation and cognate expressions; 
 
(g) for regulating or prohibiting any class of commercial or financial transactions relating to foodstuffs 
which in the opinion of the authority making the order, are, or if unregulated, are likely to be

(j) for the grant or issue of licences, permits or other documents, the charging of fees therefor, the 
deposit of such sum, if any, as may be specified in the order as security for the due performance of 
the conditions of any such licence, permit or other document, the forfeiture of the sum so deposited 
or any part thereof for contravention of any such conditions and the adjudication of such forfeiture 
by such authority as may be specified in the order; 
 
(k) for any incidental and supplementary matters, including in particular, the entry, search or 
examination of premises, aircraft, vessels, vehicles or other conveyances and animals and the 
seizure by a person authorised to make such entry, search or examination of any article in respect 
of which such person has reason to believe that a contravention of the order has been, is being or is 
about to be, committed and any packages, coverings, or receptacles in which such articles are 
EP-EBCL 
320 
found; (ii) of any aircraft, vessel, vehicle or other conveyance or animal used in carrying such 
articles, if such a person has reason to believe that such aircraft, vessel, vehicle or other 
conveyance or animal is liable to be forfeited under the provisions of this Act; (iii) of any books of 
account and documents which in the opinion of such person, may be useful to, or relevant to any 
proceeding under this Act and the person from whose custody such books of account or documents 
are seized shall be entitled to make copies thereof or to take extracts therefrom in the presence of 
an officer having the custody of such books of account or documents. 
Fixing the Price of Essential Commodities being sold to Government 
Section 3(3) vests powers in Central Government to deal with the pricing of the essential commodities 
particularly when the commodities are being sold to Central/State Government in compliance of order under 
clause (f) of Sub-section (2) of Section 3. In such a case, the price shall be paid as provided hereunder: 
 
(a) the agreed price, where the price can be agreed upon consistently with the controlled price fixed 
under this section; 
 
(b) controlled price: where no such agreement can be reached, the price calculated with reference to 
controlled price; 
 
(c) the price calculated at the market rate prevailing in the locality on the date of sale, where neither 
clause (a) nor clause (b) applies. 
Fixing the Price of Essential commodities during Emergency 
Section 3(3A)(i) is in the nature of an emergency provision and can be resorted to meet a situation arising at 
a particular locality. It empowers the Central Government to direct the price at which the foodstuffs in any 
locality will be sold to general public. This direction will be issued only when the Central Government is of the 
opinion that takings such step is necessary for controlling price rise or preventing the hoarding of any 
foodstuff in any locality. The notification issued by the Government to the above effect shall be in force for 3 
months only as may be specified therein as per Sub-section (3A)(ii). Further, for selling specified foodstuffs 
in the specified locality, the seller shall be paid price therefor as follows: 
 
(a)  agreed price, when the price can be agreed upon consistently with the controlled price fixed under 
this sub-section; or 
 
(b) the controlled price, when no such agreement can be reached at as stated above; or 
 
(c) the market rate price as per the prevailing market rate in the locality at the date of sale where 
neither of the above clause (a) or (b) apply. 
Payment of Procurement Price for Foodgrains and Edible Oil 
The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 1976, inserted Sub-section (3B) in substitution of the then 
existing section providing for payment of procurement price of such foodgrains, edible oils or oilseeds as 
may be specified by State Government with the prior approval of Central Government. Therefore, as per 
Section 3(3B) where any person is required in terms of an order under Sub-section (2)(f) to sell to the Central 
Government or a State Government or any officer or agent of such Government or to a Corporation owned or 
controlled by such Government any grade or variety of foodgrains, edible oil and oilseeds in relation to which 
no notification has been issued Under Section 3(3A) or such notification, having been issued, has ceased to 
be in force, procurement price shall be paid irrespective of the provisions of Sub-section (3) having regard to 
the following facts: 
 
(a) the controlled price, if any, fixed under this section or by or under any other law for the time being in 
                                                                         Lesson 14         Essential Commodities Act, 1955 321 
force for such grade or variety of foodgrains, edible oils and oilseeds; 
 
(b) the general crop prospects; 
 
(c) the need for making such grade or variety of foodgrains, edible oils and seeds available at 
reasonable prices to the consumers, particularly the vulnerable sections of the consumers; and 
 
(d) the recommendations, if any, of the Agricultural Prices Commission with regard to the price of the 
concerned grade or variety of foodgrains, edible oils and oilseeds. 
Fixing Price for Sugar to be Paid to Producer 
Sub-section (3C) of Section 3 provides that where any producer of sugar is required by an order made under 
Sub-section (2)(f) to sell any kind of sugar to the Central or State Government/officer or agent of such 
government or to any person/class of persons, whether notification in this regard under Sub-section (3A) is 
issued or not or ceased to be in force and notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-section (3), the 
producer shall be paid such price for sugar as the Central Government may, by order, determine having 
regard to (a) the minimum price, if any fixed for sugar cane by the Central Government under this section; (b) 
the manufacturing cost of sugar; (c) the duty or tax, if any, paid or payable thereon; and (d) the securing of a 
reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar. 
Further, the Central Government may determine different prices for different areas from time to time or for 
different factories or for different kinds of sugar. It is explained in the sub-section that producers for the 
purposes of this sub-section shall include persons carrying on business of manufacturing sugar. 
Price fixation under Section 3(2) and 3(3B) is different from price fixation in the case of sugar under Sub-
section (3C). In the former, the dominant purpose in fixing price is to ensure that goods are available to 
consumers at a reasonable price. In the latter, price fixed must also give a reasonable return on investment 
to the producer. 
Sub-section (3D) of the Act empowers the Central Government to direct that no producer, importer or exporter 
to sell or otherwise dispose of or deliver any kind of sugar or remove any kind of sugar from the bonded 
godowns of the factory in which it is produced, whether such godowns are situated within the premises of the 
factory or outside or from the warehouses of the importers or exporters, as the case may be, except under and 
in accordance with its direction. However, this provision does not affect the pledging of such sugar by any 
producer or importer in favour of any scheduled bank as defined in clause (e) of Section 2 of the Reserve Bank 
of India Act, 1934 or any corresponding new bank constituted under section 3 of the Banking Companies 
(Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970, so, however, that no such bank sells the sugar pledged to 
it except under and in accordance with a direction issued by the Central Government. 
In terms of Sub-section 3(E) the Central Government has been empowered to direct from time to time, by 
general or special order, any producer or importer or exporter or recognised dealer or any class of producers 
or recognised dealers, to take action regarding production, maintenance of stocks, storage, sale, grading, 
packing, marking, weighment, disposal, delivery and distribution of any kind of sugar in the manner specified 
in the direction. 
Power to Appoint Authorised Controller 
The Central Government has been vested with necessary powers under Sub-section (4) of Section 3 to 
authorise any person (known as authorised controller) when it is considered necessary for maintaining or 
increasing the production and supply of essential commodities. The authorised controller shall exercise such 
functions of control as may be provided in the order with respect to the whole or any part of any such 
EP-EBCL 
322 
undertaking engaged in the production and supply of the commodity. The authorised controller shall exercise 
his functions in accordance with any instructions given to him by the Central Government. He shall not have 
any power to give any direction inconsistent with the provisions of any enactment or any instrument 
determining the functions of the person in charge of the management of the undertaking except in so far as 
may be specifically provided by the order. The undertaking shall be carried on in accordance with any 
directions, given by the authorised controller under the provisions of the order. The person who is 
responsible to function as a manager of the undertaking or part of it shall comply with such directions. 
Issuance and Service of Order 
An order made under Section 3 of the Act shall be issued and served in the manner as provided under 
Section 3(5) i.e. in the following manner: 
 
(a) in the case of an order of general nature or affecting a class of persons be notified in the official 
gazette; and 
 
(b) in the case of an order directed to a specified individual be served on such individual (i) by 
delivering or tendering it to that individual, or (ii) if it cannot be so delivered or tendered, by affixing it 
on the outer door or some other conspicuous part of the premises in which that individual lives, and 
a written report thereof shall be prepared and witnessed by two persons living in the neighbourhood.  
Laying the Order before Parliament 
Sub-section (6) provides that every order made under Section 3 by the Central Government or by any officer 
or authority of Central Government shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament as soon as may be, after it 
is made. 
Imposition of Duties on State Government 
Section 4 of the Act provides that an order made under Section 3 may confer powers and impose duties 
upon the Central Government or the State Government or officers and authorities of the Central Government 
or State Government and may contain directions to any, State Government or to officers or authorities 
thereof as to the exercise of any such powers or discharge of any such duties. 
Delegation of powers 
In terms of Section 5, the Central Government may, by notified order direct that the power to make orders or 
issue notifications under Section 3 shall in relation to such matters and subject to such conditions, if any, as 
may be specified in the direction be exercisable also by (a) such officer or authority subordinate to Central 
Government, (b) such State Government or such officer or authority subordinate to a State Government as 
may be specified in the direction. 
NATURE OF ORDER PASSED UNDER THE ACT 
It may be noted from the foregoing paragraphs that the order notified by the Government under Section 3(2) 
specifies the various aspects which may be covered under the order while ensuring the production, 
procurement and distribution of the essential commodities. Further, Sub-sections (3), (3A), (3B), (3C) provide 
for issuance of order for fixation of prices of the essential commodities. Order may be passed for appointing 
Controlling Authority under this Act which is of different nature being administrative in kind and effect. Sub-
section (5) provides for the issuance and service of the order. The order notified by the Government is such 
an important document that the Act provides, under Sub-section (6) of Section 3, for it to placed before both 
Houses of Parliament. Thus, the order in its nature, is a medium of administering the Act and a proper 
                                                                         Lesson 14         Essential Commodities Act, 1955 323 
course of communication to and from the Government, exercising and delegating the powers vested in the 
Government under the Act. 
Effect of the Order 
Section 6 provides that the order made under Section 3 shall have effect notwithstanding anything 
inconsistent therewith contained in any enactment other than this Act or any instrument having effect by 
virtue of any enactment other than this Act. 
It could be seen that this section does not either expressly or by implication, repeal any of the provisions of 
the pre-existing laws, nor does it abrogate such laws. The object of Section 6 is simply to by-pass them. 
Thus, for example, an order made under Section 3 would be operative in regard to the essential commodities 
covered by the Textile Control Order, wherever there is any repugnancy in that order with any existing law 
and to that extent the existing law with regard to those commodities will not operate. 
The Calcutta High Court had observed that the ultimate effect of Section 6 is that an order under Section 3 
will override existing laws, only on the ground that these are orders validly made under Section 3 of the Act 
(Ramananda Agrawala v. State AIR 1951 Calcutta 120). 
As rightly pointed out by the Patna High Court, Section 6 is a saving section which affords protection to the 
orders made under Section 3 of the Act as against the onslaught of any law, merely by reason of 
inconsistency (Mohammad Anwar Hussi v. State of Bihar, AIR 1955 Patna 220). 
Presumption as to Orders 
Section 13 provides that where an order purports to have been made and sign by an authority in exercise of 
any powers conferred by or under this Act, a court so presume that such order was so made by that authority 
within the meaning of Indian Evidence Act, 1972.  
Burden of Proof in certain cases 
Section 14 provides that on being prosecuted for contravention of any order made under Section 3 which 
prohibits him from doing any act or being in possession of a thing without lawful authority or without a permit, 
licence or other document such person shall have to prove that he has such authority, permit, licence or 
other document as the burden of proof lies upon him. 
Protection for Acts done in Pursuance of Order 
Section 15 provides immunity against action taken in good faith under the Act and lays down that no suit, 
prosecution or other legal proceedings can be taken against any person for anything which is in good faith 
done, or intended to be done, in pursuance of any order made under Section 3 of the Act. Likewise, no suit 
or other legal proceedings can lie against the Government, for any damage caused or likely to be caused, by 
any thing which is in good faith done, or intended to be done, in pursuance of any order made under Section 
3 of the Act. 
It may be noted that immunity can be claimed by the Government or by its officers, only if it is shown that an 
order was issued under Section 3 of the Act, and the liability which the plaintiff is seeking to enforce arises 
from the fact that action was taken in pursuance of the order of the government under that section. 
CONFISCATION OF ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES 
Seizure and Confiscation of Essential Commodities 
The Essential Commodities Act envisages two independent proceedings against a person charged with 
EP-EBCL 
324 
contravention of the provisions of the Act. Under Section 6A, the Collector can confiscate the seized 
commodity and under Section 7, the contravention would be punishable. Confiscation of essential 
commodities is a sharp weapon which the Act has provided to the Central Government under Section 6A of 
the Act. 
Section 6A provides that where any essential commodity is seized in pursuance of an order made under 
Section 3, a report of such seizure shall be made, without any unreasonable delay, to the Collector of the 
district or the Presidency town in which such essential commodity is seized. The Collector at his discretion, 
may direct for the production of the seized commodity before him and if he is satisfied that there has been 
contravention of the order he may pass order for confiscation of (a) the essential commodity so seized, (b) 
any package, covering or receptacle in which such essential commodity is found, and (c) any animal, vehicle, 
vessel or other conveyance used in carrying such essential commodity. Provided that without prejudice to 
any action which may be taken under any other provision of this Act, no foodgrains or edible oilseeds seized 
in pursuance of an order made under Section 3 in relation thereto from a producer shall, if the seized 
foodgrains or edible oilseeds have been produced by him, be confiscated under this section. Provided further 
that in the case of any animal, vehicle, vessel or other conveyance the owner of such animal, vehicle etc., 
shall be given an option to pay in lieu of its confiscation, a fine not exceeding the market price at the date of 
seizure of the essential commodity sought to be carried by such animal, vehicle, vessel, or other 
conveyance. 
The Act uses the expressions ‘confiscation’ and ‘seizure’ in Section 6A and under this section a commodity 
which has been seized in pursuance of an order under Section 3 can be confiscated under the 
circumstances mentioned in Section 6A. Therefore, it is essential to-know in brief the distinction between 
seizure and confiscation.  
‘Seizure’ 
 
 
The expression ‘seize’ means to take possession contrary to the wishes of the owner of the 
property and that such action is unilateral action of the person seizing. The person from whom 
anything is seized loses, from the moment of seizure, the right or power to control or regulate the 
use of that thing. The dictionary meaning of the word ‘seize’ means to lay hold of suddenly or 
forcible, to take hold of, to reach and grasp, to clutch’. It also means ‘to take possession of or 
appropriate in order to subject to the force or operation of a warrant, order of Court or other legal 
processes. A reference to some provisions of the Codes of Criminal Procedure shows that the term 
seizure had been used therein in connection with the taking of actual physical possession of 
moveable property. 
 
‘Confiscation’ 
 
 
‘Confiscation’ according to Wharton’s Law Lexicon, is condemnation and adjudication of property 
to the public treasury as of goods seized under the Customs Act. Confiscation, according to 
Strouds judicial Dictionary, must be an act done in some way on the part of the Government of the 
                                                                         Lesson 14         Essential Commodities Act, 1955 325 
country where it takes place and in some way beneficial to that Government, though the proceeds 
may not strictly speaking be brought into its treasury. In State of Kerala v. Mathai (1961 K.L.T. 169) 
it was pointed out that confiscation is not to be considered part of the sentence for an offence but 
is only a mode by which Courts can dispose of property which comes before it in criminal trials. 
That being the general distinction between confiscation and seizure, in the context of the Essential 
Commodities Act, it could be seen that an essential commodity which has been seized, could be confiscated. 
Therefore, confiscation is an action posterior to the seizure of the essential commodity. A commodity that 
has not been seized cannot be confiscated. Seizure itself does not imply confiscation. The seizure should 
have been made by virtue of an order passed under Section 3 of the Act. Clause (j) of Section 3 empowers 
the Government to make an order for seizure of any essential commodity if an order made by the Central 
Government controlling production, supply, distribution etc. of essential commodities has been or is about to 
be contravened. Therefore, any contravention or intended contravention of an order passed by the 
Government under the Act may lead to seizure, and under the circumstances mentioned in Section 6A such 
seized commodity could be confiscated. 
Power is conferred on the Collector to confiscate any animal, vehicle, vessel or other conveyance if used in 
carrying the essential commodities. Where it was clear from the report of the Sub-Inspector of Police that the 
jeep in question was not found or used for carrying any essential commodity, it was found moving in front of 
the lorry which was loaded with paddy, it was held that, that by itself was no ground for its seizure. Unless 
the vehicle was used for carrying the essential commodities, the Deputy Commissioner had no jurisdiction to 
initiate proceedings for its confiscation, much less the police to seize it. [Ramchandra v. Sub-Inspector of 
Police (1976) 1 Kar. LJ. 126] 
The Collector has no jurisdiction to go into the validity of the seizure; he could only confiscate goods, out of 
those seized, in respect of which contravention is established. Only if the seizure is valid could the Collector 
have jurisdiction to go on into the question whether there has been any contravention of the control order in 
respect of the whole or part of the goods, seized at this is entirely different from saying that the Collector 
could go on with the enquiry, postulated in Sections 6A and 6B, when the seizure itself, on which alone his 
jurisdiction to make an enquiry depends, is found to be illegal. [Hindustan Aluminium v. Controller of 
Aluminium, AIR (1976) DeWii225] 
In S. Seetharamayya Gupta v. Distt. Revenue Officer, Chittoor (AIR 1977 AP 103) it was held that delegation 
of power of the Collector under Section 6A to Distt. Officer is competent and valid. Even though Section 6A 
authorizes confiscation of seized goods it does not say that the entire seized quantity should be directed to 
be confiscated. It is left to the discretion of the Distt. Revenue Officer land the appellate authority to decide 
whether the entire seized stock should be confiscated or only a portion of it. That, however, is a judicial 
discretion and must be exercised judicially having regard to the circumstances of the case, the gravity of the 
matter and other relevant and pertinent factors. The Act provides for enquiry and total absence of adequate 
opportunity to the party to make representation and consequently passing order of confiscation must be held 
bad.  
Sale of the Confiscated Commodity 
Ssection 6A(2) provides that where the Collector, on receiving a report of seizure or on inspection of any 
essential commodity under Sub-section (1) above, is of the opinion that the essential commodity is subject to 
speedy and natural decay or it is otherwise expedient in the public interest so to do he may (i) order the 
same to be sold at the controlled price, if any, fixed for such essential commodity under this Act or under any 
other law for the time being in force; (ii) where no such price is fixed, order the same to be sold by public 
auction. Provided that in case of foodgrains, the collector may, for its equitable distribution and availability at 
EP-EBCL 
326 
fair prices, order the same to be sold through fair price shops at the price fixed by the Central Government or 
by the State Government as the case may be, for the retail sale of such foodgrains to the public. 
Disposal of Sale Proceeds of Confiscated Goods 
In terms of Section 6A(3), the sale proceeds of the essential commodity sold, after deduction of the 
expenses of any such sale or auction or other incidental expenses relating thereto shall be paid to the owner 
or person from whom it is seized in the following circumstances: (a) where no order of confiscation is 
ultimately passed by the Collector; (b) where an order passed on appeal under Sub-section (1) of Section 6C 
so requires, or (c) where in a prosecution instituted for the contravention of the order in respect of which an 
order of confiscation has been made under this section, the person concerned is acquitted. 
Issue of Show Cause Notice before Confiscation of Essential Commodity 
Before passing an order for confiscation under Section 6A, in terms of Sub-section (1) of Section 6B of the 
Act, the owner of the essential commodity, package, covering, receptacle, animal, vehicle, vessel or other 
conveyance or the person from whom it is seized is required to be given a notice in writing informing him of 
the grounds on which it is proposed to confiscate the above goods to provide him an opportunity of making a 
representation in writing within a reasonable time and give him a reasonable opportunity of being heard in 
the matter. 
It is also provided in Sub-section (2) that no order of confiscation can be made if the owner of the confiscated 
animal, vehicle, vessel or other conveyance proves to the satisfaction of the Collector that the said modes of 
transport owned by him were used in carrying the essential commodity without his knowledge or connivance 
of himself or his agent, if any, and each of them had taken the necessary precautions against such use. 
It is not sufficient for the owner to prove that the vehicle carried the essential commodity without his 
knowledge or concurrence. He must also prove that the vehicle was used without the knowledge, or 
concurrence of the person in charge of the vehicle. In addition, he must prove that not only he but also the 
person incharge of the vehicle had taken all reasonable and necessary precautions against such use [Shai 
Rahhim v. State of Andhra (1976) LT 357]. 
However, once an order confiscating the goods of above description has been passed it shall not be held 
invalid in terms of Sub-section (3) merely by reason of any defect or irregularity in the notice given under 
clause (a) of Sub-section (1) if in giving such notice the provisions of that clause have been substantially 
complied with. 
Appeal against Confiscation Order 
In terms of Sub-section (1) of Section 6C, any person aggrieved by an order of confiscation under Section 6A 
may appeal to the State Government concerned within one month from the date of passing the order. The 
State Government shall give an opportunity to the appellant to be heard and pass such order as it may think 
fit, confirming, modifying or annulling the order appealed against. In terms of Sub-section (2) of Section 6C, if 
the appeal has been decided in favour of appellant, he is entitled to the possession of the confiscated goods 
and if it is not possible for any reason to return the essential commodity seized from him, such person shall 
be paid the price therefor as if the essential commodity had been sold to the Government with reasonable 
interest calculated from the day of seizure of essential commodity and such price shall be determined in 
accordance with: (i) Sub-section (3B) of Section 3 in case of foodgrains, edible oils and oilseeds; (ii) Sub-
section (3C) of Section 3 in case of sugar; and (iii) Sub-section (3) of Section 3 in case of any other essential 
commodity. 
                                                                         Lesson 14         Essential Commodities Act, 1955 327 
Confiscation and punishment 
Section 6D provides that the award of any confiscation under this Act by the Collector shall not prevent the 
infliction of any punishment to which the person affected thereby is liable under this Act. 
Bar of Jurisdiction in Matters of Confiscation 
The 1976 Amendment Act has inserted Section 6-E in the Act which provides that no court, tribunal or 
authority shall have any jurisdiction to make an order with regard to the matters falling within the purview 
of this Act particularly wherever any essential commodity is seized in pursuance of an order made under 
Section 3 when the Collector or the judicial authority appointed under Section 6C shall have the 
jurisdiction. 
OFFENCES AND PENALTIES 
Cognizance of offences 
Section 10A of the Act declares that notwithstanding anything contained in the Criminal Procedure Code, 
1971, every offence punishable under the Act shall be cognizable. 
A cognizable offence is one, where, under the Criminal Procedure Code or any other law in force, a police 
officer may arrest a person without a warrant.  
Section 11 lays down that before a Court can take cognizance of any offence punishable under the Act, the 
following three conditions must be satisfied, viz. (i) there must be a report in writing, (ii) the report must be 
made by a public servant, as defined in Section 21 of Indian Penal Code, or any aggrieved person or any 
recognised consumer association. 
Prosecution of Public Servants (Section 15A) 
If any public servant is accused of any offence alleged to have been committed by him while acting, or 
purporting to act, in the discharge of his duties, in pursuance of any order made under Section 3, no court 
can take cognizance of such an offence except with the previous sanction—(a) of the Central Government in 
the case of a person who is employed in connection with the affairs of the Union; and (b) of the State 
Government in the case of a person who is employed in connection with the affairs of the State. 
Penalties 
Section 7 of the Act deals with penalties. Contravention of an order passed by the Central Government under 
Section 3 with reference to clause (h) or (i) of Sub-section (2) thereof is punishable with imprisonment for a 
term which may extend to one year and also with fine [Section 7(1)(a)(i)]. For the contravention of an order 
with reference to other clauses of Sub-section (2) of Section 3 the punishment is imprisonment for a term 
ranging from three months to seven years and in addition fine is also leviable. 
Further if any person contravenes any order made under Section 3, any property in respect of which the 
order has been contravened shall be forfeited to the Government and any package, covering, receptacle in 
which the property is found and any animal, vehicle, vessel or other conveyance used in carrying the 
property, could also be forfeited if the court so orders. 
If any person to whom a direction is given under Section 3(4) (b) fails to comply with it, he shall be 
punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three months but which may extend to 
seven years and shall also be liable to fine. 
If any person convicted of an offence under Section 7(1)(a)(ii) or 7(2) is again convicted of an offence under 
EP-EBCL 
328 
the same provision he shall be punishable with imprisonment for the second and for every subsequent 
offence for a term which shall not be less than six months but which may extend to seven years besides fine. 
For adequate and sufficient reasons the court can award imprisonment for a term less than six months. 
Where an offence is committed for a second time, besides the above punishment, the Court can also order 
that the person shall not carry on any business of that essential commodity for such period not being less 
than six months as may be specified by the Court. 
 
Mens rea (Sections 6A and 7) 
In Nathulal v. State of Madhya Pradesh (AIR 1966 S.C. 43) it was held by the Supreme 
Court that mens rea or guilty mind is an ingredient of the offence punishable under 
Section 7 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 i.e., an intentional contravention of 
an order made under Section 3, is an essential ingredient of an offence under Section 7. In other words, if 
the dealer did believe bona fide that he could store the foodgrains for instance, without infringing any order 
under Section 3, there could be no contravention under Section 7. 
It was observed by the Supreme Court in this case that mens rea is an essential ingredient of any criminal 
offence. Mens rea by necessary implication may be excluded from a statute only where it is absolutely 
clear that the implementation of the object of the Statute would otherwise be defeated. The nature of mens 
rea that would be implied in a Statute creating an offence depends on the object of the Act and the 
provisions thereof. 
In Hariprasad Rao v. State (AIR 1951 SC 264), it was observed that unless a Statute either clearly or by 
necessary implication rules out mens rea as a constituent part of a crime, an accused cannot be found 
guilty of an offence against the criminal law unless he has got a guilty mind. Therefore, mens rea is an 
essential ingredient of an offence under Section 7 of the Act. 
It is to be noted that the contravention under Section 6A is also of the same character. Section 6A in brief 
provides for seizure and confiscation based on ‘contravention’ of an order under Section 3. Therefore, the 
Collector before exercising his powers under the section would be entitled to take into consideration the 
question whether there was an intentional contravention of the order or whether the conduct of the dealer 
was bona fide under the belief that he was acting legally. But it should be remembered that the orders of the 
Collector are provisional in the sense that the Court is entitled, on appeal by the dealer, to look into whole 
matter to see whether there were reasons to confiscate the goods under Section 6A. It can be concluded that 
the provisions as regard ‘contravention’ under Section 6A or 7 are in pari materia—the contravention which 
details confiscation is of the same kind as that for which a dealer can be punished. 
An interesting question is whether the doctrine of mens rea applies to cases of vicarious liability, as for 
instance, in the case of a master and servant It is well accepted that the legislature cannot introduce the 
principles of vicarious liability and make the master liable for the act of his servants, although the master 
himself had no mens rea. Thus, in one case the charge against the respondents was that they sold some 
cloth in excess of the controlled price, and thus contravened the provisions of the Madhya Bharat Cotton 
Control Order; one of the respondents, Gangaram Saboo was not present in the shop at the time the cloth 
was alleged to have been sold, and it was, therefore, held that he could not be held vicariously liable for the 
act of his munim who had actually sold the cloth (State v. Gangaram AIR 1935 H.B. 244). 
  
                                                                         Lesson 14         Essential Commodities Act, 1955 329 
Culpable Mental State  
Section 10-C provides for a presumption of culpable mental state, which 
includes intention, motive, knowledge of a fact and the belief in a fact. It is now 
provided that in any prosecution for an offence under the Act which requires a 
culpable mental state on the part of the accused, the Court shall presume the 
existence of mental state. Of course, it is open to the accused to prove that he 
had no such mental state with respect of the act committed by him. 
Attempt and Abetment 
Section 8 provides that any person who attempts to contravene or abets a contravention of any order made 
under Section 3 shall be deemed to have contravened that order. 
False Statement 
A person shall be punishable under Section 9 with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years or 
with fine or with both for the following offences: 
 
(i) when required by any order made under Section 3 to make any statement or furnish any information, 
makes any statement or furnishes any information which is false in any material particular which he 
knows or has reasonable cause to believe to be false or does not believe to be true, or 
 
(ii) makes any such statement as aforesaid in any book, account, record, declaration, return or other 
document which he is required by any such order to maintain or furnish. 
Offences by Companies 
Section 10(1) provides that if the person contravening an order under Section 3 is, a company, every person 
who, at the time of the contravention, was in charge of, and was responsible to, the company for the conduct 
of the business of the company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the contravention, and shall be liable to be 
punished accordingly. In such cases, the company itself is also liable to be proceeded against. Any such 
person, can, however, escape liability if he proves that the contravention took place without his knowledge or 
that he exercised all due diligence to prevent it. 
It may be noted that the term ‘company’ as used above, refers to any body corporate, and even includes a firm 
or other association or individuals. In the case of a firm, the term ‘Director’ would mean a partner in the firm. 
Publication of names of convicted companies by Court 
Section 10-B of the Act provides that the Court may cause to be published in newspapers or in other manner 
at the expense of the company the name, place of business and the offence/contravention committed by it 
when a company has been convicted. However, no publication shall be made until the period for preferring 
an appeal against the order of the Court has expired, without any appeal having been preferred or where 
such appeal having been preferred, was disposed of. The expenses of any publication shall be recoverable 
from the company as if it were a fine imposed by Court. 
GRANT OF INJUNCTION BY CIVIL COURTS (SECTION 12B) 
It is expressly provided by Section 12B that no Civil Court can grant any injunction or make any order for any 
other relief against the Central or State Government or any public officer, in respect of any act done, or 
purporting to be done, by such person in his official capacity under the Act, or any Order made thereunder, until 
after notice of the application for such injunction or other report is given to the Government or to such officer.

LESSON ROUND-UP 
• 
Essential Commodities Act, 1955 has been enacted to provide in the interest of the general public for the control of 
the production, supply and distribution of and trade and commerce in, certain commodities. 
• 
Section 2A dealing with Essential commodities declaration, etc. defines the "essential commodity” as to means a 
commodity specified in the Schedule to the Act. 
• 
Central Government has been empowered to administer the provisions of the Act by issuing orders/directions 
notified in the official gazette and by delegating the authority to State Governments and administrators of Union 
Territories.  
• 
An essential commodity which has been seized could be confiscated. Therefore, confiscation is an action posterior 
to the seizure of the essential commodity. A commodity that has not been seized cannot be confiscated. Seizure 
itself does not imply confiscation. 
• 
Mens rea or guilty mind is an essential ingredient of the offence punishable under the Act.  
• 
Culpable mental state, which includes intention, motive, knowledge of a fact and the belief in a fact. 
• 
Where an offence is committed by a company, if it is proved that the offence had been committed with the consent 
or connivance of or is attributable to any neglect on the part of any Director, Manager, Secretary or other officer of 
the company, such a person shall be deemed to be guilty of that offence, and is liable to be proceeded against and 
punished accordingly. 
• 
The Act expressly provides that no Civil Court can grant any injunction or make any order for any other relief against 
the Central or State Government or any public officer, in respect of any act done, or purporting to be done, by such 
person in his official capacity under the Act, or any Order made thereunder, until after notice of the application for 
such injunction or other report is given to the Government or to such officer.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
“Weights and measures may be ranked among the 
necessaries of life to every individual of human 
society. They enter into the economical arrangements 
and daily concerns of every family", said Mr. John 
Quincy Adams, the Sixth US President in his report to 
Congress in 1821.  
The essence of these words show the importance of 
weights and measures. In fact, the influence and impact 
of the system of weights and measures for trade use is 
as pervasive as ever. Weights and measures embrace 
every aspect of modern living. It is therefore critical for 
any country to have an accurate system of weights and 
measures. Such a system is indispensable in facilitating 
trade – as it fosters certainty, trust and confidence in all 
transactions involving weights and measures. It 
underpins fair trade and competition and promotes 
efficiency, and in so doing, helps economy to grow. 
Metrology studies many types of measurements. It 
studies not only length but also such measurements as 
weight and time. Each and every one of these elements 
can be studied in various manners as well. In 
metrology, there are set standards that are set for 
measurement qualities to determine what the typical 
measurement is. In many cases, they also have a well 
thought out plan as to how much of a degree of error 
there is as well in each measurement. There are 
various answers to questions about metrology because, 
in many cases, each theory can be right. Metrology 
goes back thousands of years to early civilization and 
was present well before the aspects of science as well.  
The branch of knowledge concerning weights and 
measures is technically known as legal metrology. In 
basic 
form, 
metrology 
is 
the 
science 
of 
measurement. 
 
  
Legal metrology Act, 2009 intend to establish and enforce standards of weights and measures, regulate trade and 
commerce in weights, measures and other goods which are sold or distributed by weight, measure or number and 
for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL 
332 
INTRODUCTION 
Legal Metrology is the name by which the law relating to weights and measures is known in international 
parlance. Legal Metrology is very vital for scientific, technological and industrial progress of any country. The 
establishment of national standards of weights and measures and their proper enforcement aim at ensuring 
accuracy of measurements and measuring instruments and thus legal metrology strengthens the national 
economy in a broader sense besides being a potential instrument of consumer protection. The scope of legal 
metrology according to international practice extends to three broad fields of human activities, namely, 
commercial transactions, industrial measurements and measurements needed to ensure public health and 
human safety. The coverage of legal metrology varies from country to country. In some, almost all practical 
measurements are brought under the purview of legal metrology, whereas in other countries legal metrology 
finds restricted application in a few quantities like mass, length and volume used in trade and commerce. In 
most of the countries, however, legal metrology encompasses measurements which have a bearing on the 
protection of individuals from the financial and environmental points of view. 
Legal metrology can be defined as that part of metrology which deals with units of measurement, methods of 
measurement and measuring instruments in so far as they concern statutory, technical and legal 
requirements which have the ultimate object of assuring public guarantee from the point of view of security 
and of appropriate accuracy of measurements. 
International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML) 
The International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML) is an intergovernmental treaty organization whose 
membership includes Member States, countries which participate actively in technical activities, and 
Corresponding Members, countries which join the OIML as observers. It was established in 1955 in order to 
promote the global harmonization of legal metrology procedures. Since that time, the OIML has developed a 
worldwide technical structure that provides its Members with metrological guidelines for the elaboration of 
national and regional requirements concerning the manufacture and use of measuring instruments for legal 
metrology applications. 
According to OIML legal Metrology is the entirety of the legislative, administrative and technical procedures 
established by, or by reference to public authorities, and implemented on their behalf in order to specify and 
to ensure, in a regulatory or contractual manner, the appropriate quality and credibility of measurements 
related to official controls, trade, health, safety and the environment. 
The OIML develops model regulations, International Recommendations, which provide Members with an 
internationally agreed-upon basis for the establishment of national legislation on various categories of 
measuring instruments. Given the increasing national implementation of OIML guidelines, more and more 
manufacturers are referring to OIML International Recommendations to ensure that their products meet 
international specifications for metrological performance and testing.  
OIML Certificate System for Measuring Instruments 
The OIML Certificate System for Measuring Instruments was introduced in 1991 to facilitate administrative 
procedures and lower the costs associated with the international trade of measuring instruments subject to 
legal requirements. The System provides the possibility for a manufacturer to obtain an OIML Certificate and 
a Test Report indicating that a given instrument type (pattern) complies with the requirements of the relevant 
OIML International Recommendations. Certificates are delivered by OIML Member States that have 
established one or several Issuing Authorities responsible for processing applications by manufacturers 
wishing to have their instrument types (patterns) certified. 
                                                                         Lesson 15        Legal Metrology Act, 2009 333 
Certificates issued by OIML are accepted by national metrology services on a voluntary basis, and as the 
climate for mutual confidence and recognition of test results develops between OIML Members, the System 
serves to simplify the type (pattern) approval process for manufacturers and metrology authorities by 
eliminating costly duplication of application and test procedures.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Article 17 of Universal Declaration on Human Rights 
provides that everyone has the right to own property 
alone as well as in association with others and no 
one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property. As 
per Article 300A of Constitution of India, persons not 
to be deprived of property save by authority of law. 
Property has, always, been on the fundamental 
elements of socio economic life of an individual. 
Transfer of Property means an act by which a living 
person conveys property in present, or in future, to 
one or more other living persons, or to himself and 
one or more other living persons and "to transfer 
property" is to perform such an act. Consequently, 
the law relating to transfer of property is not only an 
important branch of civil law but also one that 
demands proper elucidation due to its complexity.  
Therefore, students should be well versed in this 
subject so as to understand the intricacies involved in 
the transfer of property. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
The law relating to transfer of property is governed by the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. The very preamble to the Act 
suggests that it simply defines and amends certain parts of the law relating to transfer of property by act of parties.

covered by certain Regulations and Acts, the Courts in India in the absence of any statutory provisions, 
applied rules of English law as the rule of justice, equity and good conscience. 
The Act was enacted with the object to amend the law relating to the transfer of property by act of parties. 
The Act excludes from its purview the transfers by operation of law, i.e. by sale in execution, forfeiture, 
insolvency or intestate succession. The scope of the Act is limited, as it is confined to transfers inter vivos 
and excludes testamentary succession, i.e. transfers by will. 
The very preamble to the Act suggests that it simply defines and amends certain parts of the law relating to 
transfer of property by act of parties, and it does not at all profess to be an exhaustive enactment as is 
revealed by the omission of the word “consolidate”. Therefore, the Act leaves the scope for applying rules of 
justice, equity and good conscience if a particular case is not covered by any of the provisions of the Act. But 
if it is covered, the Act must be applied.

IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS 
However, while explaining the provisions of the Act, the terms used are defined there itself, yet some of the 
important terms used under the Act are as follows: 
Instrument  
"Instrument" means a non-testamentary instrument. 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
347 
Attached to the earth 
Attach to the earth means: 
 
(a) rooted in the earth, as in the case of trees and shrubs; 
 
(b) imbedded in the earth, as in the case of walls or buildings; or 
 
(c) attached to what is so embedded for the permanent beneficial enjoyment of that to which it is 
attached. 
Absolute Interest 
When a person owns property, he has an "absolute interest" in the property. Ownership consists of a bundle 
of rights, the right to possession, right to enjoyment and right to do anything such as selling, mortgaging or 
making gift of the property. If A is the owner of a land, he has an absolute interest in the land. If A sells his 
land to B, then B becomes the owner and he acquires an absolute interest in the land he has purchased from 
A. Likewise if A makes a gift of his property to B, there again B gets an absolute interest in the property 
which is gifted to him. These are instances where persons may have an absolute interest. 
Reversion and Remainder 
Some interests in the property are called in English Law, reversion and remainders. A "reversion" is the 
residue of an original interest which is left after the grantor has granted the lessee a small estate. For 
example, A, the owner of a land may lease it to B for a period of five years. The person who grants the lease 
is the lessor and the person who takes the lease is called the lessee. Here, after the period of 5 years the 
lease will come to an end and the property reverts back to the lessor. The property which reverts back to him 
is called the reversion or the reversionery interest. The grantor has a larger and an absolute interest out of 
which he carves out a smaller estate and gives to the grantee, i.e. the lessee. 
When the owner of the property grants a limited interst in favour of a person or persons and gives the 
remaining to others, it is called a "remainder". For instance, A the owner of a land transfers property to B for 
life and then to C absolutely. Here the interest in favour of B is a limited interest, i.e., it is only for life. So long 
as A is alive he enjoys the property. He has a limited right since he cannot sell away the property. His right is 
only to enjoy the property. If he sells this interest it will be valid so long as he is alive. So after B’s death the 
property will go to C, interest is called a remainder. In the case of a "remainder", the property will not come 
back to the owner, but it goes over to the other person. 
Vested and Contingent Interests 
The word "vested" is used in two different senses. It may mean "vested in possession" or "vested in interest". 
A right is said to be "vested in possession" when it is a right to present possession of property and it is said 
to be "vested in interest" when it is not a right to present possession but a present right to future possession. 
For instance, if a land is given to A for life with a remainder to B, A’s right is vested in possession, B’s right is 
vested in interest. In the above example, the interest of B is not subject to any uncertain condition. It will 
come into his possession after A’s life comes to an end. Therefore, an interest is said to be vested when it is 
not subject to any condition, precedent, i.e., when it is to take effect on the happening of an event which is 
certain, whereas an estate is contingent when the right to enjoyment depends upon the happening of an 
event which may or may not happen. Thus, a gift to A on the death of B creates a vested interest in A even 
during the life time of B for there is nothing more certain than death. But a gift to A on the marriage of B 
creates a contingent interest, for B may never marry at all but that contingent interest becomes vested if and 
when B marries. 
EP-EBCL 
348 
A vested interest is transferable and heritable. If property is given to A for life and afterwards to B, B gets a 
vested interest and if B transfers this interest to C, C will take when the life estate of A comes to an end. B’s 
interest, since it is vested, is also heritable. Therefore, if B dies during the lifetime of A, C will get the property 
after the death of A. 
A contingent interest, as said above, is an interest which takes effect after the condition is satisfied. It is 
subject to a condition precedent, i.e., unless A marries B’s daughter, he will not get the property. The 
following example will illustrate this point. Property is given to A for life and then to B if he marries C. B 
should marry C before A dies. If he does so, his interest is converted into vested interest. Before B marries C 
his interest is contingent. The contingent interest is not heritable although it is transferable. In a vested 
interest the transfer is complete, but when the interest is contingent the transfer depends upon a condition 
precedent. In a condition precedent the estate is not vested in the grantee until the condition is fulfilled. 
Distinction between a vested and a contingent interest:  The following are the principal points of distinction 
between a vested and a contingent interest: 
 
1. When an interest is vested the transfer is complete. It creates an immediate proprietory interest in 
the property though the enjoyment may be postponed to a future date. A contingent interest on the 
other hand is dependant upon the fulfilment of some conditions which may or may not happen. In 
other words, in case of vested interest, the owner’s title is already prefect; in case of a contingent 
interest, the title is as yet imperfect but may become perfect on the fulfilment of a stipulated 
condition. 
 
2. A vested interest takes effect from the date of transfer. A contingent interest in order to become 
vested is conditioned by a contingency which may not occur. 
 
3. A vested interest cannot be defeated by the death of the transferee before he obtains possession. A 
contingent interest may fail in case of the death of transferee before the fulfilment of condition. 
 
4. Since vested interest is not circumscribed by any limitation which derogates from the completeness 
of the grant, it logically follows that a vested interest is transferable as well as heritable. If, therefore, 
a transferee of the vested interest dies before actual enjoyment, it will devolve on his legal heirs. A 
contingent interest, on the other hand, cannot be inherited though it may be transferred coupled with 
limitation regarding fulfilment of a condition. 
 
MOVEABLE AND IMMOVEABLE PROPERTY 
The term “property” signifies the subject matter over which the right of ownership or any less right carved out 
of ownership (e.g. mortgage right) is exercised. The Act deals with (i) various specific transfers relating to 
Immoveable property and (ii) lays down general principles relating to transfer of both moveable and 
immoveable property. Chapter II of the Act is divided into two parts. Parts A deals with the rules pertaining to 
both moveable and immoveable property (Section 5 to 37), Part B embodies the rules relating to immoveable 
property (Section 38 to 53A). The other chapters of the Act deal with transfers such as sales, mortgages, 
leases, gifts, exchanges and actionable claims. The rules relating to these transactions are referred to as 
rules governing special transfers to immoveable property. The fundamental rule relating to all transfers is that 
a transfer cannot be effected in any other way except as prescribed under the Act. Furthermore, the Act 
states that certain kinds of property cannot be transferred at all. 
The first task is to define and distinguish between moveable and immoveable property. 
Moveable property 
The Transfer of Property Act does not defines the term "moveable property". Therefore, it is to be defined 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
349 
with the help of other statutes. For e.g., it has been defined in the General Clauses Act, 1897 as to mean 
“property of every description except immoveable property”. The Registration Act defines "moveable 
property" to include property of every description excluding immoveable property but including standing 
timber, growing crops and grass. 
For the purpose of law, moveable property is sometimes regarded as immoveable property. This may 
happen when a thing of chattel is attached or embedded in earth. For instance, if a machinery or a plant is 
installed on the land, the question arises whether the machinery or the plant is moveable property or 
immoveable property. In order to find out whether such a thing or chattel is an immoveable property or not, it 
is to find out the mode of annexation of the thing and the object or purpose of such annexation. If the 
machinery is fixed on the land permanently then it becomes immoveable property, whereas if the machinery 
or engine or any other thing is fixed on a temporary basis, then it will be regarded as moveable property. 
Thus, where the owner of a piece of land installed a bone mill along with machinery being held by iron bars 
which have been dug to a considerable depth then it is a permanent fixture and this will become immoveable 
property. Similarly, the machinery installed on a cement platform and held in position by being attached to 
iron pillars fixed in the ground was held to be immoveable property as the annexation was made by the 
person who owned the buildings as well as the machinery (Mohamed Ibrahim v. Northern Circars Fibre 
Trading Company, A.I.R. 1944 Mad. 492). 
Immoveable property 
The term “immoveable property” is also not defined under the Act. However, it is defined in the negative 
sense as “the immoveable property does not include standing timber, growing crops, or grass” (S. 3 Para 2). 
Standing timber are trees fit for use for building or repairing houses. This is an exception to the general rule 
that growing trees are immoveable property. 
Growing crops:  It includes all vegetable growths which have no existence apart form their produce such as 
pan leaves, sugar cane etc. 
Grass:  Grass is moveable property, but if it is a right to cut grass it would be an interest in land and hence 
forms immoveable property. 
The General Clauses Act defines the term "immoveable property" but not exhaustively. It states: 
“immoveable property shall include land, benefits to arise out of land and things attached to the earth, or 
permanently fastened to any thing attached to the earth” [Section 3(25)]. The Indian Registration Act 
expressly includes under to immoveable property the benefits to arise out of land, hereditary allowances, 
rights of way, lights, ferries and fisheries. 
If the definitions of "immoveable property" as given in the Transfer of Property Act, the General Clauses Act 
and the Registration Act are viewed together, it is evident that they do not say what immoveable property is. 
They only say what is either included or excluded therein. Still, reading the definition in the Act with one in 
the General Clauses Act, immoveable property will be found to include land, benefit to arise out of land such 
as rent, and things attached to the earth like trees and buildings but not standing timber, growing crops and 
grass. The last three things are regarded as severable from the land on which they stand and, therefore, they 
are not included in the term "immoveable property". 
Thus, the meaning of immoveable property is as under: 
"Immoveable property" means land, benefits to arise out of land, and things attached to the 
earth, or permanently fastened to anything attached to the earth. 
EP-EBCL 
350 
“Attached to the earth” means (a) rooted in the earth, as in the case of trees and shrubs; (b) embedded in the 
earth, as in the case of walls or buildings; or (c) attached to what is so embedded for the permanent 
beneficial enjoyment of that to which it is attached (S. 3 Para 6 of the Act). 
Things rooted in the earth:  Trees and Shrubs are immoveable property according to this definition subject to 
the exception as to standing timber. 
Things embedded in the earth:  A house being embedded in the earth is immoveable property and this is so 
even if it is sold for enjoyment as a house with an option to pull it down. The mode of annexation and object 
of annexation are the two tests to determine whether it is immoveable property or not. 
Attached to what is so...:  The attachment must be as the section says for the permanent beneficial 
enjoyment of that to which it is attached e.g. the doors, windows of a house or moveable parts of fixed 
machinery. But the attachment must be intended to be permanent. 
A orally grants to B for Rs. 700/- the rights to catch and carry away fish from his lake. Is the grant valid? The 
Supreme Court in Ananda Behra v. State of Orissa, (1956) SCJ p. 96, that such a right is a benefit arising 
out of immoveable property namely the lake. So under General Clauses Act it is immoveable property. The 
sale requires a registered instrument for its validity under Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act. 
Therefore, the oral grant is invalid and cannot pass away any title in favour of B. 
Distinction between moveable and immoveable property 
The distinction between moveable and immoveable property was explained 
in the case of Sukry Kurdepa v. Goondakull, (1872) 6 Mad. H.C. 71, by 
Holloway J. as moveability may be defined to be a capacity in a thing of 
suffering alteration. Immoveablity for such alteration e.g., a piece of land in 
all circumstances is immoveable. If a thing cannot change its place without 
injury to the quality it is immoveable. Certain things e.g. trees attached to 
the ground are so long as they are so attached, immoveable when the 
severance has been effected they become moveable. 
The following have been recognised as immoveable property: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property

The following have been held not to be immoveable property: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RULES 
RELATING 
TO 
TRANSFER 
OF 
PROPERTY 
(WHETHER 
MOVEABLE 
OR 
IMMOVEABLE) 
According to Section 5 of the Transfer of Property Act, the term “transfer of property” means an act by which 
a living person conveys property in present, or in future, to one or more other living persons, or to himself, 
and one or more other living persons and "to transfer property" is to perform such an act. In this section, 
"living person" includes a company or association or body of individuals whether incorporated or not. But the 
general provisions of the Act as to transfer do not effect the special provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. 
To effect a transfer, property must be in existence. The word “transfer” is defined with reference to the word 
“convey”. The fundamental rule is that a transfer cannot be affected in any way not prescribed by the Act. 
The first point to note is that transfer inter vivos (i.e., between living persons) alone is contemplated by the 
Act. A transfer by means of a will is not a transfer according to the Act, because it is not a transfer between 
two living persons. Section 5 also says that the transfer may be “in present or in future”. The words in 
present or in future qualify the words ‘conveys’, and not the word ‘property’. A transfer of property not in 
existence operates as a contract to be performed in future which may be specially enforced as soon as the 
property comes into existence (Jugalkishore v. Ram Cotton Company, (1955) I SCR 1369). 
Further Section 6 (h) provides that no transfer can be made in so far as it is opposed to the nature of the 
interest attached thereby or for an unlawful object or consideration or to a person legally disqualified to be a 
transferee. 
WHO CAN TRANSFER THE PROPERTY? 
According to Section 7 of the Transfer of Property Act, every person who is competent to contract and 
entitled to transferable property, or authorised to dispose of property is competent to transfer such property. 
Hence, every person competent to contract and having ownership can trasnfer property. According to Indian 
Contract Act, a person is competent to contract when he is a major and of sound mind and is not disqualified 
from contracting by any law to which he is subject. But a minor can be a transferee as there is nothing in the 
EP-EBCL 
352 
Transfer of Property Act to disqualify a person, who is a minor to be a transferee. Thus, a mortgage can be 
validly executed in favour of a minor who has paid the consideration (Hari Mohan v. Mohini, 22 C.W.C. 130, 
Raghava v. Srinivasa, (1917) 60 Mad. 308). Persons who are authorised to transfer property can also 
transfer property validly. Although a minor is not competent to be a transferor yet a transfer to a minor is 
valid. However, there are exceptions to this: 
If a person holds himself out is the owner with the consent of the owner i.e. doctrine of holding out or if a 
person represents to be the owner i.e. doctrine of feeding the grant by estoppel. 
SUBJECT MATTER OF TRANSFER 
Section 6 of the Transfer of Property Act says that property of any kind may be transferred except as provided 
by this Act or any other law for the time being in force. The words “property of any kind” indicate that 
transferability is the general rule and the right to property includes the right to transfer the property to another 
person. Property of any kind excludes from its purview the future property. A transfer of future property can only 
operate as a contract which may be specifically performed when the property comes into existence. 
Exceptions to the general rule of transferability made by other laws 
Certain restrictions are placed by Hindu law and Mohammedan law on the transfer of property. 
FORMALITIES OF TRANSFER 
Property can be transferred either orally or by writing. Moveable property can be transferred by delivery of 
possession or by registration. Section 54 lays down the mode of transfer of immoveable property. Such 
transfer, in the case of tangible immoveable property of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards, or in 
the case of a reversion or other intangible thing, can be made only by a registered instrument. 
In the case of tangible immoveable property of a value less than one hundred rupees, such transfer may be 
made either by a registered instrument or by delivery of the property. 
The tangible property means a property which can be touched physically and hence, capable of physical 
dealing. 
The intangible property means something in abstract, either capable of being touched or perceived and yet 
standing in relation to a certain thing. 
‘Reversion’ means the bundle of rights remaining with the lessor after the execution of a lease of a certain 
immoveable property. 
When a transfer is effected in writing, the person who signs the document professing to transfer the property 
is called the executant. Execution consists in affixing his signature to the document to the effect that he is 
transferring the property. An illiterate person who cannot write may direct some literate person to sign it on 
his behalf and in his presence and the illiterate person may put his thumb impression. 
(i)  Attestation 
Attestation is an important formality in connection with the execution of transfer. "Attest" means to testify a 
factor, to bear witness to a fact. Attestation, in relation to a document, signifies the fact of authentication of 
the signature of the executant of that document by the attestator by putting down his own signature on the 
document in testimony of the fact of its execution. All transfers do not require attestation. For example, a sale 
or a lease does not require attestation. But a mortgage or a gift requires that a mortgage deed or a gift deed 
must be attested by two or more witnesses. 
Attestation is valid and complete when two witnesses sign the instrument. According to the definition given in 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
353 
the Transfer of Property Act (Section 3), the following essentials are required for a valid attestation: 
 
(a) There must be at least two or more witnesses; 
 
(b) Each witness must see (a) the executant’s sign or affix his mark to the instrument, or (b) some other 
person sign the instrument in the presence and by the direction of the executant, or (c) receive from 
the executant a personal acknowledgement of his signature or mark or of the signature of such 
other person; and 
 
(c) Each witness must sign the instrument, (i.e. document), in the presence of the executant. 
It is not necessary that both attesting witnesses should be present at the same time. The instrument may be 
attested after its execution by each of the attestators at different times. Attestation cannot take place before 
the execution of the deed. The Act does not insist on any particular form of attestation. The attesting witness 
may not be described as such on the face of the document (Yakub v. Kalzurkan, 52 Bombay 203). However, 
the attesting witness must have put his signature antmus attestandi, i.e., with intention to attest. Thus, where 
a Registrar or an identifying witness puts his signature on the document he cannot be regarded as an 
attesting witness unless it is duly proved that he signed with the necessary intention to attest. 
(ii)  Registration 
Registration is an essential legal formality to effect a valid transfer in certain cases. The advantage of 
registering a document is that any person who deals with the property would be bound by the rights that are 
created in earlier registered document. 
Illustration 
A executes a mortgage on property X and gets it registered. Subsequently he sells property X to B, B is 
bound by the right of the mortgagee over the property X. Thus, whether B knows actually or not that there 
was a mortgage the fact that the earlier document was registered is a notice to B and B takes property, 
subject to the rights of the mortgagee. Therefore, if a document of transfer relating to immoveable property is 
required by the law to be and has been effected by registered instrument, the persons who deal with the 
property subsequently are deemed in the eye of law as having knowledge of the such registered instrument 
from the date of its registration. 
(iii)  Notice 
Notice, may be actual or constructive. If a person knows about a fact, he has an actual notice. But, in certain 
circumstances law treats a man who ought to have known a fact even though he did not in fact know it. This 
is called constructive notice. 
The equitable doctrine of notice is recognised in various Sections of this Act. For instance in Section 39 of the 
Act, where a transfer is made of property out of which a person has a right to receive maintenance, the 
transferee takes subject to that right if he had notice of it, but not otherwise. Similarly under Section 40 if A 
conveys to C property, which he had by a previous contract agreed to sell to B, then B can enforce the contract 
against C, if C had notice of it, but not otherwise. If C had notice of the prior contract, he purchases with 
knowledge that it was unconscionable of A to sell to him, and it is therefore, unconscionable of him to buy. 
A person is deemed in the eye of law to have constructive notice of a fact when (i) but for willful absentation 
from an enquiry or search which he ought reasonably to have made; or (ii) gross negligence on his part, he 
would have known it. Constructive notice arises from an irrefutable presumption of notice. In law such a 
presumption will arise when (i) there is a willful absentation on the part of a person to make necessary 
enquiries regarding the existence of certain facts, or (ii) he showed gross negligence in the matter. 
EP-EBCL 
354 
The words “wilful absentation” suggest want of bona fide in respect of particular transaction (Joshua v. 
Alliance Bank, 22 Cal. 185). Thus, a person who refuses to receive a registered letter is, deemed to have 
constructive notice of its contents. 
Similarly, if a person proposes to sell his property to X who, at the same time knows that rents due in respect of 
the property are paid by the tenants to a third person Y, X will be fixed with notice of the rights of Y (Mernt v. 
Luck (1902) 1 Ch. 429). 
In so far as gross negligence is concerned, it does not mean a mere carelessness but means carelessness 
of such an aggravated nature as to indicate mental indifference to obvious risks. For example, if A buys 
property from B and does not care to ask whether any amount by way of municipal tax is due on that 
property and if the municipal corporation asks him to pay the arrears of tax, then B is responsible, and if he 
does not pay, then the arrears of tax may be made a charge on the property. 
Other Illustrations 
 
(a) Where a purchaser was informed that the title deeds were in the possession of a bank for safe 
custody and yet failed to make any enquiry in the bank. It was held that he was guilty of gross 
negligence and must be deemed to have notice of the rights of the bank which has the custody of 
the title needs (Imperial Bank of India v. Rai Gyand, I A 283). 
 
(b) Where a person abstained from making further enquiries about the right of a person and did not 
cause a search, to be made in the office of the Sub-Registrar to ascertain if there was any 
encumbrance over the property, his omission must be held to be wilful or grossly negligent and he 
would be said to have notice of the prior encumbrances (Rangappa Goundan v. Marapa Goundan, 
AIR (1958) Madras 515). 
The three Explanations to the definition of notice in Section 3, further mention certain circumstances wherein 
statutorily presumption of knowledge arises. These circumstances relate to the fact of registration 
(Explanation-I, Explanation-II) actual possession and notice to an agent (Explanation-III). 
 
RESTRAINT ON TRANSFERS OR RULE AGAINST INALIENABILITY 
Section 10 of the Act says that when property is transferred, the transferee should not be restrained 
absolutely from alienating the property. One may give property to another subject to a condition, but the 
condition should not be one which absolutely prevents the transferee from alienating the property. Suppose, 
B gives property to A and his heirs adding a condition that if the property is alienated it should revert to B. 
This condition is invalid and the transferee can ignore such condition. The transfer takes effect and is valid, 
and the condition not to alienate the property is void. 
Examples of absolute restraint 
Suppose, A gives to B property worth only 2,000 rupees and adds a condition that B should sell property for 
`50,000 and not below that amount, this condition will at once become invalid for no one will buy the property 
which is only worth `2,000 for Rs. 50,000. Similarly, A gives to B property worth `50,000 and stipulates that if 
B wants to sell the property he should sell it to C only for Rs. 1,000. This again will operate as an absolute 
restraint. In Rosher v. Rosher, (1884) 26, Ch. D. 801, the testator gave his estate to his son and added a 
condition that if his son wanted to sell the property he should first give an option to the testator’s wife who 
should be able to buy for £ 3,000. The market value of the property when the testator died was £ 15,000. It 
was held by the Court that the condition which compelled the son to sell the property for £ 3,000 was void. In 
Trichinpoly Varthaga Sangum v. Shunmoga Sunderam, (1939) Madras 954, there was a partition between a 
Hindu father and his five sons. The deed of partition provided that if any one of the sons wanted to sell his 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property

share, he should not sell it to a stranger but to one of his brothers who should have the option to buy for a 
sum not exceeding `1,000. It was held by the Court that the condition absolutely prevented the son from 
selling the property to any one for good value. In this case the market value of the property of the son was far 
greater than `1,000. Hence, the condition was declared invalid. 
Partial restraint valid 
Though absolute restraints are bad in law, partial restraints are valid. If there are conditions which restrain 
the transferee not to alienate the property outside the family, it has been held by the Courts that they are 
partial restraints. For example, whenever there are conditions in a family settlement whereby the members 
are not allowed to sell their shares to a stranger, such conditions are valid. 
But it is not permissible to restrict the alienation to a particular time. Such a restriction is not partial but an 
absolute restraint and as such invalid. 
When absolute restraint valid? 
There are two exceptions to the rule that absolute restraints are void. Firstly, in the case of a lease, the 
lessor can impose a condition that the lessee shall not sublet the property or sell his leasehold interest. Such 
conditions are valid. The reason why such an exception is made in the case of a lease is that the lessor may 
have confidence in the lessee but may not have the same confidence in some other person. So, if the lessor 
puts a condition restraining the lessee from transferring the property to someone, the condition is valid. 
The second exception is made in respect of a woman who is not a Hindu, Buddhist or Muslim. In such a 
case, a condition to the effect that she shall not have power during her marriage to transfer the property is 
valid. 
Restraint on enjoyment 
Section 11 of the Act also embodies a rule which is based on the principle that restraint on the enjoyment of 
the property is invalid. The section lays down that where land is transferred by one to another, the transferor 
should not impose conditions as to how and in what manner the transferee should enjoy the property. 
Illustrations 
 
(a) A sells his house to B and adds a condition that B only should reside in that house, the condition is 
invalid. This is subject to the exception that, if a person transfers a plot of land keeping another plot 
for himself, he can impose certain conditions which may interfere with the right of enjoyment of the 
transferee. 
 
(b) A has properties X and Y. He sells property Y to B and puts a condition that B should not construct 
on property Y more than one storey so that A’s property X which he retains should have good light 
and free air. 
Thus, it is clear in the above illustration that the condition which is imposed by A is for the benefit of another 
property which he retains. Such a condition is valid. 
Section 12 also makes the transfer void if a property is transferred to any person adding a condition that if 
such person becomes insolvent he ceases to hold that property. Such a condition is not recognised as valid 
in law. Again, this is subject to the exception that if a landlord leases his property he can impose a condition 
on the lessee that if the lessee becomes insolvent the lease should come to an end. 
TRANSFER FOR BENEFIT OF UNBORN PERSON 
Section 13 of the Transfer of Property Act lays down that where on a transfer of property, an interest therein 
EP-EBCL 
356 
is created for the benefit of a person not in existence at the date of transfer, subject to a prior interest created 
by the same transfer, the interest created for the benefit of such person shall not take effect unless it extends 
to the whole of the remaining interest of the transferor in the property. Thus if a property is given to an 
unborn person, two conditions should be satisfied: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Illustration 
A transfers property of which he is the owner to B in trust for A and his intended wife successively for their 
lives, and after the death of the survivor, for the eldest son of the intended marriage for life, and after his 
death for A’s second son. The interest so created for the benefit of the eldest son does not take effect, 
because it does not extend to the whole of A’s remaining interest in the property. 
CONDITIONAL TRANSFER 
When an interest is created on the transfer of property but is made to depend on the fulfillment of a condition 
by the transferee, the transfer is known as a conditional transfer. Such a transfer may be subject to a 
condition precedent or a condition subsequent. If the interest is made to accrue on the fulfilment of a 
condition, the condition is said to be condition precedent. For instance, A agrees to sell his land to B if B 
marries C. This is a condition precedent. The condition precedent will be allowed to operate only if it is not hit 
by the provisions of Section 25 of the Act. Section 25 in the first place, says that, the condition must not be 
impossible to fulfil. For example, A lets a farm to B on condition that he shall walk a hundred miles in an 
hour. The lease is void. Secondly, the condition must not be forbidden by law. Thirdly, it should not be of 
such a nature that if permitted it would defeat the provisions of any law. For instance, A transfers Rs. 500 to 
B on condition that he shall murder C. The transfer is void. Fourthly, it should not be fraudulent. For example, 
X gives a false receipt to Y on behalf of his principal in consideration of transfer of land. The transfer would 
be void. Fifthly, the condition should not be such as to cause injury to the person or property of another. And 
lastly the condition should not be immoral or opposed to public policy. Thus, an agreement to give a son or 
daughter in adoption for a consideration is opposed to public policy as trafficking in children is forbidden by 
law. 
If the condition is not hit by any of the above provisions, it is valid. Still the law does not insist on its literal 
fulfilment. It is sufficient if it is substantially complied with. Thus, where A transfers, Rs. 5,000 to B on 
condition that he shall marry with the consent of C, D and E. B marries with the consent of C and D only as E 
has died earlier. B is deemed to have fulfilled the condition. 
A transfer may also be made subject to a contingency which may or may not occur. Thus, an interest may be 
created with the condition superadded that it shall cease to exist in case a specified uncertain event shall 
happen, or in case a specified uncertain event shall not happen. 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
357 
This is known as condition subsequent. Condition subsequent is one which destroys or divests the rights 
upon the happening or non-happening of an event. For example, A transfers a farm to B for his life with a 
proviso that in case B cuts down a certain wood, the transfer shall cease to have any effect. B cuts down the 
wood. He loses his life interest in the farm. Similarly, if A transfers a farm to B provided that B shall not go to 
England within three years after the date of transfer, the interest in the farm shall cease. B does not go to 
England within the term prescribed. His interest in the farm ceases. 
Now you will notice the distinction between condition precedent and condition subsequent. In condition 
precedent, the condition comes before the interest; whereas in condition subsequent, the interest is created 
before the condition. The one precedes the vesting of right and the other follows the vesting. In condition 
precedent, the vesting of right is delayed until the happening of an event. In condition subsequent, there is 
no postponement of vesting of right though it is to be destroyed or divested by reason of non-fulfilment of 
condition. There are certain situations where the law says that either the transfer will take effect on the 
fulfillment of a condition or will not take effect at all. 
Again, if a transfer is made to defeat or delay the rights of a creditor, the transfer may be declared invalid by 
the creditor. In some cases, if property is transferred during the period when parties are litigating in a Court 
over a piece of property, then the transfer is not valid, or even if there is a transfer, it is subject to the rights 
that are created in the Court’s decree. All these circumstances are given in the Transfer of Property Act e.g., 
doctrine of election, doctrine of fraudulent transfers and doctrine of Lis pendens. 
DOCTRINE OF ELECTION 
Section 35 of the Transfer of Property Act deals with what is called doctrine of election. Suppose, a property 
is given to you and in the same deed of gift you are asked to transfer something belonging to you to another 
person. If you want to take the property you should transfer your property to someone else, otherwise you 
cannot take the property which is transferred to you by some one. Election may be defined as “the choosing 
between two rights where there is a clear intention that both were not intended to be enjoyed. 
The foundation of doctrine of election is that a person taking the benefit of an instrument must also bear 
the burden, and he must not take under and against the same instrument. It is, therefore, a branch of a 
general rule that no one may approbate and reprobate (Copper v. Copper (1874) H.L. 53). However 
doctrine of election could not be applied to deprive a person of his statutory right to appear invoking 
extraordinary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 136, (PR Deshpande v. MB Haribatti (1995 
(2) Scale 804 SC). 
Illustration 
A transfers to you his paddy field and in the same deed of transfer asks you to transfer your house to C. 
Now, if you want to have the paddy field you must transfer your house to C, because the transferor is 
transferring to you his paddy field on the condition that you give your house to C. 
Thus, either you take the paddy field and part with your house or do not take it at all. This is called the 
doctrine of election. You must elect either to take under the instrument, in which case you will have to fulfil 
the condition and bear the burden imposed upon you or you must elect against the instrument, in which case 
neither the benefit nor the burden will come to you. The doctrine is based on the principle that “a donee shall 
not be allowed to approbate and reprobate and that if he approbates, he shall do all in his power to confirm 
the instrument which he approbates” (Cavendish v. Decre 31 C.D. 466). 
In case, the person upon whom benefit is conferred rejects it, the property which was attempted to be 
transferred to him will revert to the transferor and it is he who will compensate the disappointed person. If the 
EP-EBCL 
358 
transferor dies before the person upon whom the benefit is conferred and he rejects the transfer, then the 
representatives of the transferor will have to satisfy the disappointed person out of the property which was 
the subject of transfer. 
Explanation of the above principle 
A transfers his property worth `1,000 and by the same instrument asks B to transfer his property worth `500 
to C. Here, if B does not accept, he will not take A’s property and the property will revert to A. If A is alive, it 
is for him to give some property to C. But if A dies before B has made his election then the heirs of A have to 
compensate C from A’s property to the extent of `500. (You will note that B’s property worth `500 was 
intended by A to be transferred to C). 
The question of Election arises only when a transfer is made by the same document. If the transferor makes 
a gift of property by one deed and by another asks the donee to part with his own property then there is no 
question of election. 
Illustration 
A transfers his land to B by a document. A by another document transfers B’s property to C. In this case B 
can retain the property given to him and refuse to transfer his property to C as the two transfers do not form 
part of the same document. 
Further, the doctrine of election is applicable if the benefit is given directly. A person taking no benefit directly 
under a transaction but deriving a benefit under it indirectly need not elect. 
Illustration 
A transfers his property to B’s son and by the same instrument transfer B’s property to C. In this case B need 
not to elect and can keep his property. His son can have his gift. 
There is, however, an exception to the doctrine of election. That is, if the transferor gives two benefits to a 
person and one particular benefit is in lieu of an item of property belonging to that person which the 
transferor has asked to transfer to a third-party then if the person elects to retain his property, he can retain 
the other benefit. 
Illustration 
Under A’s marriage settlement, his wife is entitled, if she survives him to the enjoyment of the estate of 
Sultanpur during her life. A by his will bequeaths to his wife an annuity of `200 p.m. during her life, in lieu of 
her interest in the estate of Sultanpur, which estates he bequeaths to his son. A also gives his wife a legacy 
of `1,000. After the death of A, his widow elects to take what she is entitled to take under the marriage 
settlement (i.e., the enjoyment of estate of Sultanpur). In this case, the wife has to forfeit the claim of `200 
which her husband has given to her. But she can claim other benefit i.e., `1,000. 
Election may be express or implied by conduct. 
Illustration 
A transfers to B an estate to which C is entitled, and as part of the same transaction gives C a coal mine. C 
takes possession of the mine and exhausts it. He has thereby confirmed the transfer. 
In case of disability, the condition shall be postponed until the disability ceases, or until the election is made 
by some competent authority. 
TRANSFER BY OSTENSIBLE OWNER OR DOCTRINE OF HOLDING OUT 
Where, with the consent, express or implied, of the persons interested in immoveable property, a person is 
the ostensible owner of such property and transfers the same for consideration, the transfer shall not be 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
359 
voidable on the ground that the transferor was not authorised to make it, provided that the transferee, after 
taking reasonable care to ascertain that the transferor had power to make the transfer, has acted in good 
faith. (Section 41) 
The following conditions are necessary for the application of Section 41: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If any one of these elements is absent, the transferee is not entitled to the protection of this section. 
This Section is a statutory application of the law of estoppel. The section makes an exception to the rule that 
a person cannot confer a better title than he has. An ostensible owner is one who has all the indicia of 
ownership without being the real owner. 
Illustrations 
 
(a) A made a gift of property to B but continued in possession of the gifted property. He purported to 
exercise a power of revocation and then transferred the property to the defendant. The gift, 
however, was not revocable as it was an unconditional gift. B seeks to recover possession from the 
defendant. The defendant invoked protection under Section 41.  
 
 In the given example, the donor is not an ‘ostensible owner’ holding the property with the consent of 
the real owner. The defendant cannot, therefore, invoke the protection of Section 41. 
 
(b) The manager of a joint Hindu family consisting of some minor members alienated the ancestral 
house to P without any necessity and the alienee transferred it to the defendants. The minors 
challenged the alienation. The defendants sought protection under Section 41. 
Here Section 41 has no application for “P was not the ostensible owner of the ancestral family house with the 
consent, express or, implied, of the persons interested in the said ancestral house in as much as the plaintiff, who 
had an interest in the said house, did not and could not by reason of the disability of infancy give their consent”. 
DOCTRINE OF FEEDING THE GRANT BY ESTOPPEL 
Where, a person fraudulently or erroneously represents that he is authorised to transfer certain immoveable 
property and professes to transfer such property for consideration, such transfer shall, at the option of the 
transferee, operate on any interest which the transferor may acquire in such property at any time during 
which the contract of transfer subsists. (Section 43) 
Nothing in this Section shall impair the right of transferees in good faith for consideration without notice of the 
existence of the said option. 
Essentials: In order to invoke this section, the transferee must prove that: 
The transferor is the ostensible owner
He is so by the consent express or implied, of 
the real owner
The transfer is for consideration
The transferee has acted in good faith taking 
reasonable care to ascertain that th e transferor 
had power to transfer
EP-EBCL

Illustration 
A, a Hindu, who has separated from his father B, sells to C three fields, X, Y and Z, representing that A is 
authorised to transfer the same. Of these fields, Z does not belong to A, it having been retained by B on the 
partition, but on B’s dying, A as heir obtains Z. C, not having rescinded the contract of sale may require A to 
deliver Z to him. Thus, where a grantor has purported to grant an interest in land which he did not at that time 
possess, but subsequently acquires, the benefit of his subsequent acquisition goes automatically to the 
earlier grantee or as it usually expressed, feeds the estoppel. 
DOCTRINE OF FRAUDULENT TRANSFER 
Where a person transfers his property so that his creditors shall not have anything out of the property, the 
transfer is called a fraudulent transfer. A debtor in order to defeat or delay the rights of a creditor, may 
transfer his property to some person, who may be his relative or a friend. The law does not allow this. 
Section 53 embodies the principle. It states: 
“Every transfer of immoveable property made with intent to defeat or delay the creditors of the transferor 
shall be voidable at the option of any creditor so defeated or delayed.” 
Thus, where an owner of the property contracts a debt and then transfers his property to someone so that 
the creditor cannot proceed against the property to realise his debt, such a transfer is voidable at the option 
of the creditor. The transfer is valid so long as the creditor does not challenge it in a Court of law and gets a 
declaration that the transfer is invalid. A suit instituted by a creditor to avoid a transfer on the ground that it 
has been made with intent to defeat or delay the creditors of the transfer or shall be instituted on behalf of, or 
for the benefit of all the creditors. Once the creditor sues the debtor and says that the debtor has the 
intention to deceive him, the transfer can be declared invalid by the Court. The creditor has to satisfy the 
Court that there was an intention on the part of the debtor to defeat his rights. If he does not prove this, then 
the creditor will fail and the transfer is valid. The question arises as to when we can say that the transferor 
has the necessary intention to defeat the claim of the creditor. This can be gathered from the surrounding 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
361 
circumstances. Suppose a man takes a loan from the creditor. He does not pay the loan. Then the creditor 
sues him in a Court to get back his debt. On seeing this the debtor transfers his property to a friend of his or 
some other person who simply holds the property on behalf of the transferor. Again, the debtor may make a 
gift of his property to his wife or sell it to a friend who will afterwards retransfer the same to the transferor. 
Under these circumstances, we can easily say that the debtor’s intention was to prevent the creditor from 
taking the property by a suit in the Court and to realise his debt. 
But suppose the debtor has several creditors and he transfers his property to one of his creditors in 
satisfaction of his whole debt to him. Is this also a fraudulent transfer? The answer is No. For a mere 
preference of one creditor over the others is not fraudulent under the Section, even if the whole property is 
so transferred and nothing is left for the other creditors. But the other creditors may file a petition in the Court 
within three months of the transfer praying that the debtor be declared insolvent. If the debtor is adjudicated 
an insolvent, their interest will be protected and the transfer will be declared as fraudulent preference. The 
transfer will be set aside and the property will be distributed among all the creditors. 
However, under Section 53(2) the rights of a transferee in good-faith and for consideration are protected. It 
says nothing shall affect or impair the rights of a transferee in good-faith and for consideration. 
DOCTRINE OF PART-PERFORMANCE 
Lastly, we may also discuss briefly the doctrine of part-performance which is embodied in Section 53A of the 
Transfer of Property Act. 
A contract for the sale of land has been entered into between A and B. The transferee has paid the price 
entering into possession and is willing to carry out his contractual obligations. As registration has not been 
effected A, the transferor, seeks to evict B from the land. Can he do so? No, B will not be allowed to suffer 
simply because the formality of registration has not been through. The legislature grants some relief to such 
a transferee under Section 53A, which embodies the doctrine of part-performance. 
The rule did not exist on the statute book before 1929. Section 53A, was inserted by an 
amendment to the Act in 1929. Followings are the essential conditions for the operation of the 
doctrine of part-performance according to Section 53A. 
 
1. There must be a contract to transfer immoveable property. 
 
2. It must be for consideration. 
 
3. The contract should be in writing and signed by the transferor himself or on his behalf. 
 
4. The terms necessary to constitute the transfer must be ascertainable with reasonable certainty from 
the contract itself. 
 
5. The transferee should have taken the possession of the property in part performance of the 
contract. In case he is already in possession, he must have continued in possession in part 
performance of the contract and must have done something in furtherance of the contract. 
 
6. The transferee must have fulfilled or be ready to fulfill his part of the obligation under the contract. 
If all the abovementioned conditions are satisfied, then, the transferor and the persons claiming under him 
are debarred form exercising any right in relation to the property other than the rights expressly provided by 
the terms of the contract notwithstanding the fact that the instrument of transfer has not been registered or 
complete in the manner prescribed therefor by the law for time being in force. It should be noted that Section 
53A does not confer any positive right on the transferee. It only prohibits exercise of the right of ownership in 
EP-EBCL 
362 
relation to the property in order to evict the transferee from the property because legal requirements have not 
been satisfied. 
However, the doctrine of part-performance will not affect the right of a subsequent transferee for 
consideration without notice of the earlier contract and of its being partly performed. 
The right conferred by this section is a right only available to a defendant to 
protect his possession. This section does not create a title on the defendant. It 
merely operates as a bar to the plaintiff asserting his title. It is limited to cases 
where the transferee had taken possession, and against whom the transferor is 
debarred from enforcing any right other than that expressly provided by the 
contract. The section imposes a bar on the transferor. When the conditions 
mentioned in the sections are fulfilled, it debars him from enforcing against the transferee any right 
or interest expressly provided by the contract. So far as the tranferee is concerned, the section 
confers a right on him to the extent it imposes a bar on the transferor (Delhi Motor Co. v. Basurkas, 
(1968) SCR 720). 
The English rules as to what acts constitute part-performance have been generally followed in India. These 
rules are as follows: 
 
(1) An act of part-performance must be an act done in performance of the contract. An act introductory 
to and previous to the agreement, cannot therefore, be act of part-performance. 
 
(2) The acts relied upon must be unequivocally and referable to no other contract than that alleged. 
 
(3) An act of part-performance must be the act of the party seeking to avail himself of the equity. 
 
PROPERTIES WHICH CANNOT BE TRANSFERRED 
Section 6 of this Act contains some exceptions to the general rule that property of any kind may be 
transferred. Consequently, the following properties cannot be transferred, namely: 
 
(a) the chance of an heir apparent succeeding to an estate, the chance of a relation obtaining a legacy 
on the death of a kinsman or any other mere possibility of a like nature cannot be transferred. 
 
(b) A mere right of re-entry for breach of a condition subsequent cannot be transferred to any one 
except the owner of the property affected thereby. 
 
(c) An easement cannot be transfered apart from the dominant heritage. 
 
(d) An interest is property restricted in its enjoyment to the owner personally cannot be transferred by 
him. 
 
(e) A right to future maintenance in whatsoever manner arising, secured or determined, cannot be 
transferred. 
 
(f) A mere right to sue cannot be transferred. 
 
(g) A public office cannot be transferred nor can the salary of a public officer, whether before or after it 
has become payable. 
 
(h) Stipends allowed to military, naval, air force and civil pensioners of the Government and political 
pensions cannot be transferred. 
(a)  Chance of an heir apparent or ‘Spes Successionis’ 
In this clause possibilities referred are bare or naked possibilities and not coupled with an interest such as 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
363 
contingent remainders or future interest-also known as right of spes successionis which cannot be the 
subject to transfer. 
When a person is the owner of property, the property is in existence and it is in his possession. This he may 
transfer. But if property is neither in existence nor is the person the owner of the property then it cannot be 
transferred. For example, if a person is intending to buy certain property but, he has no interest in that 
property, he cannot transfer it unless the property comes to his hands, i.e., unless he becomes the owner of 
the property after buying it. But if a person obtains certain consideration and agrees to sell the property of 
which he is not the owner, then on becoming the actual owner of the property he has to transfer the property 
as there was a contract between him and the person who has agreed to buy the property. This transfer 
operates on a contract to be performed when the property comes into the hands of the person who has 
agreed to transfer. But where a person wants to make a gift of the property which is to come in his hands in 
future, he cannot transfer it because a gift is voluntary transfer without any consideration. Thus a gift of future 
property is void. Similarly, the chance of a heir apparent succeeding to the estate of a deceased person 
cannot be transferred. Suppose A is the owner of the property and B is his son. B is the heir of A. During the 
life time of his father A, B has only a hope expectancy that he will inherit the property of his father. This type 
of property which B hopes to get after the death of the father cannot be transferred, during the life time of A. 
Illustrations:  
(a) Suppose A, a Hindu who has separate property, dies leaving a widow W and a brother L, L’s succession 
to the property is dependent upon two factors, viz., (i) his surviving the widow, W, and (ii) W leaving the 
property intact. L has only a bare chance of succession to the property left by A. This is spes successionis, 
and therefore, cannot be transferred (Amrit Narayana v. Gyan Singh, (1918) 45 Cal. 690). 
(b) A transfers to B for valuable consideration his reversionary interest in a property. When A succeeds to the 
property, B sues him for possession of the same. B will not succeed as the reversionary interest is a spes 
successionis and non-transferable. So the transfer is void and B’s suit for possession fails. 
(b)  Right of re-entry 
The right which the lessor has against the lessee for breach of an express condition which provides that on 
its breach the lessor may re-enter is called the right of re-entry. For instance, if A leases his property to B 
and adds a condition that if B sub-lets the leased land, A will have the right to re-enter, i.e., the lease will 
terminate if the lessee breaks the condition by subletting to a third person. Thus, right of re-entry being a 
right for the personal benefit of any party cannot exist for the benefit of a person who has no personal 
interest in the land. For example, A grants his land by way of lease to B, a limited liability company on 
condition that the land should revert to A from B if the company goes into liquidation. This is a mere right in 
favour of A and this right A cannot transfer to anyone as this is a personal right which can be exercised by A 
only. But if A transfers the whole of his interest in the land including the right of re-entry to C, there the right 
to re-entry is a legal incident of property and can be validly transferred along with the property. 
(c)  Transfer of easement 
An easement is a right enjoyed by the owner of land over the land of another: such as, right of way, right of 
light, right of support, right to a flow of air or water. Section 4 of the Easements Act defines an easement as a 
right which the owner or occupier of certain land possesses as such for the beneficial enjoyment of the land, 
to do and continue to do something or to prevent and to continue to prevent something being done in or upon 
or in respect of certain other and not his own land. An easement includes a right to enjoy a profit out of the 
land of another. An easement exists for the accommodation and better enjoyment of the land to which it is 
annexed. The land owned by the possessor of the land is known as dominant tenement and the land over 
EP-EBCL 
364 
which the right is enjoyed is known as the servient tenement. As an easement confers no proprietory right on 
its owner, it cannot be transferred apart from the land itself. For example, the right of certain villagers to bath 
in another’s tank cannot be transferred. Similarly if A, the owner of a house X, has a right of way over an 
adjoining plot of land belonging to B, he cannot transfer this right of way to C. But if he transfers the house 
itself to C, the easement is also transferred to C. 
It may be noted, however, that the prohibition is only with regard to transfer of an existing easement. The law 
does not prohibit the grant or creation of new easement (Bhagwan Sahai v. Narsing. (1909) 31 ALL. 612; 
Satyanarayana v. Lakshamaya 5 H.L.J. 56 or the extension of an easement by release in favour of the owner 
of servient tenement). 
(d)  Restricted interest or personal interest 
An interest restricted in enjoyment to the owner personally is by its very nature not transferable unless the 
restriction is void under Section 10. Examples of such restricted interest or property are the following: 
 
(i) The right of pre-emption given under the Mohammedan Law. 
 
(ii) The office of a Shebait of a Temple or mohunt of a mutt or mutuwalli of a wakf. 
 
(iii) Emoluments attached to a priestly office. 
 
(iv) Service tenures. 
(e)  Right to future maintenance 
This again is a personal right in the property which the law says that it cannot be transferred. The right of a 
Hindu widow to maintenance is a personal right which cannot be transferred. Under the law the arrears of 
past maintenance can be transferred, but not the right to future maintenance. 
(f)  Mere right to sue and actionable claim 
A ‘mere right to sue’ apart from the interest from which such right accrues cannot be assigned. The ‘right to 
sue’ is a personal right annexed to the ownership of property and cannot be severed, from it. It is based on 
the principle of public policy to prevent multiplicity of suits; the object is mainly to prevent the abuse resulting 
from trafficking in litigation. 
The use of the word "mere" is significant. The question in every case is whether the subject-matter of transfer 
is property with an incidental remedy for its recovery or is a ‘mere’ right to ‘sue’. Where property is 
transferred along with a right to recover damages or compensation in respect of the property, the assignment 
is not hit by clause (4) of Section 6 of the T.P. Act. 
A mere right to sue cannot be transferred. The right refers to a right to damages arising both out of contracts 
as well as torts. For example, A commits an assault on B, B can file a suit to obtain damages; but B cannot 
assign the right to C and allow him to obtain damages. In contract also, the rule is the same. If A breaks a 
contract which he has entered into with B, B can bring action for damages, but B cannot transfer this right to 
C to recover damages. 
There is clear distinction between an actionable claim and a mere right to sue. An actionable claim is 
property and the assignee has a right to sue to enforce the claim. 
As already noted a right to recover an unascertained amount of damages resulting from breach of contract or 
tort is a mere right to sue. If, however, one has a right to recover an ascertained and definite debt, he may 
transfer it because it is an actionable claim. Thus, suppose A is indebted to B for Rs. 2,000 and B transfers 
the right to recover the debt of C, the transfer is void. A beneficial interest in specific moveable property is 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
365 
also an actionable claim. It has been held that the right to claim the benefit of an executory contract 
constitutes a beneficial interst in moveable property (Jaffer Meher Ali v. Budge Budge Jute Mills, (1900) 33 
Cal. 702). 
After breach of a contract for the sale of goods nothing is left but a right to sue for damages which cannot be 
transferred. But before breach the benefit of an executing contract for the sale of goods may generally be 
transferred and the buyer has the right to sue for the goods. 
(g)  Transfer of public office and salaries, stipends, etc. 
It is against public policy for a public officer to transfer the salary of his office, for the salary is given for the 
purpose of upholding its dignity and the proper performance of its duties. Civil and military pensions are not 
transferable. A pension retains its character as long as it is unpaid and is in the hands of Government, but as 
soon as it is paid to the pensioner or his legal representatives, it can be transferred. Since these allowances, 
pensions and stipends are given on personal basis, the law does not allow these types of property to be 
transferred. 
RULE AGAINST PERPETUITY 
Section 14 of the Act provides that no transfer of property can operate to create an interest which is to take 
effect after the life time of one or more persons living at the date of such transfer, and the minority of some 
person who shall be in existence at the expiration for that period, and to whom, if he attains full age, the 
interest created is to belong. 
The rule against perpetuity is based on the general principle that the liberty of alienation shall not be exercised 
to its own destruction and that all contrivances shall be void which tend to create a perpetuity or place property 
forever out of the reach of the exercise of the power of alienation. Perpetuity has been described as 
“exemptions from intermission or ceasing”. This has been said to be “odious in law, destructive to the 
commonwealth, and an impediment to commence, but preventing the wholesome circulation of property”. 
A perpetuity in the primary sense of the word, “is a disposition which makes property inalienable for an 
indefinite period” (Jarman on Wills, 8th ed., vol. 1, P. 284). Section 14 of the Act adopted with certain 
modifications the English rule against perpetuities which is enunciated by Jarman as “Subject to the 
exceptions to be presently mentioned, no contingent or executory interest in property can be validity created, 
unless it must necessarily vest within the maximum period of one or more lives in being and twenty-one 
years afterwards”. Section 14 of the Act fixes the perpetuity period as: Life (or Lives) living at the time of 
transfer and actual minority of the then unborn ultimate transferee. 
Any number of successive estates can be created between the transferees who are living persons e.g. A 
transfer may be made to A for life and then to B for life and then to C for life and so on, provided that A, B 
and C are all living persons at the date of the transfer. But if the ultimate beneficiary is some one who is not 
in existence at the date of the transfer, the whole residue of the estate should be transferred to him. If he is 
born before the termination of the last prior estate, he takes a vested interest at birth and takes possession 
on the termination of the last prior estate but if he is not born till the termination of the last prior estate, the 
transfer to him fails. 
Further, the rule is not that vested interest is created at the birth of the beneficiary but that vested interest 
cannot be delayed in any case beyond his minority. Therefore, the rule against perpetuity is that the minority 
of the ultimate beneficiary is the latest period at which an estate can be made to vest. 
EP-EBCL 
366 
In India minority terminates at the end of 18 years. 
The rule against perpetuities applies to both moveable and immoveable property. 
Thus, the rule against perpetuity contains two propositions, i.e.: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, Section 18 provides an exception to the above rule of perpetuity, where the transfer of property is 
for the benefit of the public in the advancement of religion, knowledge, commerce, health, safety, or any 
other object beneficial to mankind. 
Effect of a transfer on failure of prior interest 
Further, where by reason of any rules or the rules contained in Sections 13 and 14, interest created for the 
benefit of a person or class of persons fails in regard to such person or the whole of such class, any interest 
created in the same transaction and intended to take effect or upon failure of such prior intersts also fail 
(Section 16). For example, property is transferred to A for life then to his unborn son B for life and then to C, 
who is living at the date of transfer, absolutely. Here B is given only a life interest. So the transfer to B is 
invalid under Section 13. The subsequent transfer to C absolutely is also invalid, because according to 
Section 16, if a prior transfer fails, the subsequent transfer will also fail. 
No transfer of property can operate to create an interest which is to take effect after the life time of one or 
more persons living at date on such transfer, and the minority of some person who shall be in existence on 
the expiration of that period, to whom, if he attains full age, the interest created is to belong. 
The policy of the law has been to prevent property being tied up for ever. The vesting cannot be postponed 
beyond the life time of any person living at the date of transfer. For example, if an estate is given to a living 
person A for life and then to the unborn son of A, the son of A must be in existence on or before the date of 
the expiry of the life estate in favour of A. The vesting of absolute interest in favour of an unborn person may 
be postponed until he attains majority. For example, an estate may be transferred to A, living person, and 
after his death to his unborn son when he attains the age of 18. Such transfer would not be violative of the 
rule against perpetuity. 
ACCUMULATION OF INCOME 
Section 17 does not allow accumulation of income from the land for an unlimited period without the income-
being enjoyed by owner of the property. The law allows accumulation of income for a certain period only. The 
period for which such accumulation is valid is : 
 
(a) the life of the transferor, or 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
367 
 
(b) eighteen years from the date of transfer. 
Any direction to accumulate the income beyond the period mentioned above is void except where it is for: 
 
(i) the payment of the debts of the transferor or any other person taking any interest under the 
transferor, 
 
(ii) portions for children or any other person taking any interest in the property under the transfer, and 
(iii) for the preservation and maintenance of the property transferred. 
DOCTRINE OF LIS PENDENS 
Lis means dispute, Lis pendens means a pending suit, action, petition or the like. Section 52 of the T.P. Act 
incorporates the doctrine of Lis pendens. It states that during the pendency of a suit in a Court of Law, 
property which is subject to a litigation cannot be transferred. When we say that property cannot be 
transferred what we mean in this context is that property may be transferred but this transfer is subject to the 
rights that are created by a Court’s decree. For example, A and B are litigating in a Court of law over 
property X and during the pendency of the suit A transfers the property X to C. The suit ends in B’s favour. 
Here C who obtained the property during the time of litigation cannot claim the property. He is bound by the 
decree of the Court wherein B has been given the property. 
Section 52 lays down the Indian rule of Lis pendens being the legislative expression of the Maxim- “ut lite 
pendente nihil innovetur” ‘During litigation nothing new should be introduced’. 
Essentials 
In order to constitute a Lis pendens, the following elements must be present: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The rule is based on the doctrine of expediency i.e., the necessity for final adjudication. A plea of lis pendens 
will be allowed to be raised even though the point is not taken in the pleadings or raised as an issue. 
When an application to sue in forma pauperis is admitted, the suit is pending from the time of presentation of 
the application to the Court but not if it is rejected. 
A suit in foreign Court cannot operate as lis pendens. The doctrine of lis pendens does not apply to 
EP-EBCL 
368 
moveables. It is the essence of the rule that a right to immoveable property is directly and specifically in 
question in the suit. The doctrine is not applicable in favour of a third-party. 
Effect 
If the parties to the litigation, are completely prevented from transferring the property in litigation, it would 
cause unnecessary delay and hardship, as they would have to wait till the final disposal of the case. So, 
Section 53 creates a limitation over the transfer by making it subject to the result of the litigation. The effect 
of this doctrine is not to invalidate or avoid the transfer, or to prevent the vesting of title in the transfer, but to 
make it subject to the decision of the case, and the rule would operate even if the transferee pendente lite 
had no notice of the pending suit or proceeding at the time of the transfer. 
PROVISIONS RELATING TO SPECIFIC TRANSFERS 
The Act expressly provides for special types of transfers such as sale, exchange, gift, mortgage and lease. 
These are as follows: 
In a sale, exchange and gift, there is a transfer of the ownership of property but mortgage is a transfer of an 
interest in specific immoveable property and lease is a transfer of the right to enjoy immoveable property. 
1.  Sale 
 
Under Section 54 of the T.P. Act, "sale" has been defined as a transfer of ownership in exchange 
for a price paid or promised or part paid and part-promised. 
 
Essentials 
 
(a) The seller must be a person competent to transfer. The buyer must be any person who is not 
disqualified to be the transferee under Section 6(h)(3). 
 
(b) The subject matter is transferable property. 
 
(c) There is a transfer of ownership. This feature distinguishes a sale from mortgage, lease etc., where 
there is no such transfer of ownership. 
 
(d) It must be an exchange for a price paid or promised or part paid and part promised. 
 
(e) There must be present a money consideration. If the consideration is not money but some other 
valuable consideration it may be an exchange or barter but not a sale. 
Mode of transfer by sale 
Sale of an immoveable property can be effected, 
 
(a) Where such property is tangible (i) by a registered instrument if it is of the value of Rs. 100 and 
upwards, and (ii) by a registered instrument or by delivery of property when it is less than Rs. 100 in 
value, and 
 
(b) Where the property is tangible or a reversion, only by a registered instrument. 
Contract for sale 
A contract for the sale of immoveable property differs from a contract for the sale of goods in that the Court 
will grant specific performance of it unless special reasons to the contrary are shown. 
The rights and liabilities of a seller and buyer are dealt with in Section 55 of the Transfer of Property Act. 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
369 
2.  Exchange 
Sections 118 to 121 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deal with "Exchanges". 
When two persons mutually transfer the ownership of one thing for the ownership of another, 
neither thing or both things being money only, the transaction is called an "exchange". 
 
Essentials 
 
(i) The person making the exchange must be competent to contract. 
 
(ii) There must be mutual consent. 
 
(iii) There is a mutual transfer of ownership though things and interests may not be identical. 
 
(iv) Neither party must have paid money only. 
This Section applies to both moveable and immoveable property. 
Mode of exchange 
A transfer of property in completion of an exchange can be made only in the matter provided for the transfer 
of such property by sale. 
3.  Gift 
The provisions relating to "Gifts" have been stipulated under Sections 122 to 128 of the Act. 
Section 122 of the Transfer of Property Act defines "gift" as follows: 
“Gift" is the transfer of certain existing moveable or immoveable property made voluntarily and 
without consideration by one person called the donor, to another called the donee and 
accepted by or on behalf of the donee. 
Such acceptance must be made during the life time of the donor and while he is still capable 
of giving. If the donee dies before acceptance, the gift is void. 
Essentials 
 
1. There must be a transfer of ownership. 
 
2. The subject matter of gift must be a certain existing moveable or immoveable property. 
 
3. The transfer must be made voluntarily. 
 
4. It must be done without consideration. 
 
5. There must be acceptance by or on behalf of the donee, and such acceptance must be made during 
the lifetime of the donor and while he is capable of giving. 
There are two parties to the gift: donor and donee. The donor must be a person competent to transfer; 
whereas the donee may be any person. The gift can be made to any one, to an incompetent person or even 
to a juridicial person. The essence of a gift is that it is a gratuitous transfer. 
According to Section 123, a gift of immoveable property must be made by a registered instrument signed by 
or on behalf of the donor and attested by at least two witnesses. A gift of moveable property may be made by 
a registred instrument or by delivery of property. Where the donee is already in possession of the moveable 
property, as no future delivery is possible, the donor may make a declaration of the gift in his favour. For 
example, where a piece of furniture or a television set belonging to the donor is lying with a friend of his, the 
EP-EBCL 
370 
donor may simply declare that he makes a gift of the furniture or the television set and the gift is complete. 
The declaration must be clear and the donee must accept the gift. 
A gift of immoveable property, as said above, must be effected by registration. Where a gift in favour of 
someone is registered but it is not accepted by the donee, the gift is incomplete. Suppose, a document is 
executed by the donor who makes a gift of immoveable property and the deeds are delivered to donee, and 
the donee accepts the gifts but the document is not registered. Will the gift be valid? It has been held by the 
Courts that the gift is valid. While registration is a necessary formality for the enforcement of a gift of 
immoveable property, it does not suspend the gift until registration actually takes place. The donee in such a 
case can ask the donor to complete the gift by registration. Thus, the most essential thing for the validity of a 
gift is its acceptance. If the gift is accepted but not registred it is a valid gift. The Privy Council in Kalyan 
Sundram v. Kumarappa, A.I.R. 1925 P.C. 42, decided that after acceptance of the deed of gift and before 
registration, the donor cannot revoke the gift. The gift which is accepted by the donee, will take effect from 
the date of the execution of the document by the donor, even though it is registered at a later date. 
If the deed of gift is executed but never communicated to the intended donee and remains in the possession 
of the donor undelivered, it cannot be compulsory registered at the instance of the donee. The reason is that 
the donee did not accept the gift, the donor can at any time before such acceptance revoke the gift. But once 
a gift is accepted by the donee, the donor cannot revoke it. A gift may, however, be revoked if it is brought 
about by a fraud or misrepresentation or undue influence. 
The other essential characteristic of a gift is that it cannot be revoked at the will and pleasure of the grantor. 
A revocable gift is one which may be revoked by the donor at any time. Its revocation would depend upon 
the mere will or pleasure of the donor. Such a gift is void. But on the other hand, if the condition is one which 
does not depend on the will or pleasure of the donor, the gift can be revoked on the happening of such 
condition. 
Illustrations 
 
(a) A gives a field to B, reserving to himself, with B’s assent, the rights to take back the field in case B 
and his descendents die before A, B dies without descendents during A’s lifetime. A may take back 
the field. 
 
(b) A gives a lakh of rupees to B, reserving to himself with B’s assent the right to take back at leisure 
Rs. 10,000 out of one lakh. The gift holds goods as to Rs. 90,000 but is void as to Rs. 10,000 which 
continues to belong to A. 
A gift which comes into existence on the fulfilment of a condition, that is to say, a gift which is subject to a 
condition precedent is also valid. A condition precedent, as already explained in this study dealing with 
vested interest and contingent interest, is one which must be fulfilled before the transfer takes effect. But the 
condition attached to the gift should not be illegal or immoral. For instance, a gift to A on condition that he 
murders B is not valid. 
A gift comprising both of existing property and future property is void as to the latter. For example, A makes a 
gift of his house and also makes a gift of the additions that he is likely to make in future. Here the gift of the 
house is valid but the gift of the additions that are yet to be made is invalid. 
Onerous gift:  Lastly reference may also be made to what is known as an onerous gift. It may be that several 
things are transferred as a gift by single transaction. Whereas some of them are really beneficial the others 
convey burdensome obligations. The result is that the benefit which it confers is more than counter balanced 
by the burden it places. For instance, A makes a gift of shares in the companies X and Y. X is prosperous 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
371 
but heavy calls are expected in respect of shares in Y company. The gift is onerous.The rule as laid down in 
Section 127 is that the donee takes nothing by the gift unless he accepts it fully. Where the gift is in the form 
of two or more independent transfers to the same person of several things, the donee is at liberty to accept 
one of them and refuse the other. 
The rules pertaining to gifts in the Transfer of Property Act do not apply to the gifts by Mohammedans. If a 
gift is made by a Mohammedan, its validity has to be judged according to Muslim law and not according to 
the Transfer of Property Act. 
4.  Leases 
(i)  Meaning and nature of lease:  According to Section 105, a "lease" of immoveable 
property is a transfer of a right to enjoy property. Since it is a transfer to enjoy and 
use the property, possession is always given to the transferee. The lease of 
immoveable property must be made for a certain period. For example, you may give 
a lease of property for a definite number of years, or for life, or even permanently. 
 
Essentials 
The essentials of a lease are: 
 
(1) It is a transfer of a right to enjoy immoveable property; 
 
(2) Such transfer is for a certain time or perpetuity; 
 
(3) It is made for consideration which is either premium or rent or both; 
 
(4) The transfer must be accepted by the transferee. 
The transferor is called the lessor, the transferee is called the lessee, the price is called premium and the 
money, share, service or any other thing of value to be so rendered is called the rent. 
The parties to the lease (i.e. lessor and lessee), must be competent to make and to take the lease 
respectively. 
(ii)  Lease and licence:  A lease should be distinguished from a licence. A licence is a right to do or continue 
to do in or upon the immoveable property of the grantor, something which would, in the absence of such a 
right, be unlawful. 
A licence does not transfer any interest in the property and the licencee has no right to possession. A licence 
can be revoked by the grantor at any time, whereas a lease cannot be revoked. If, I sell the fruits of my 
garden to you, you are given permission or licence to enter my garden and take away the fruits. A lease 
involves a transfer of interest followed by possession of the property for a specified period. The real test is 
the intention of the parties.  
If the document creates an interest in the property, it is a lease but if it only permits another to make use of 
the property of which the legal possession continues with the owner, it is a licence because it does not create 
any interest in that property (Associated Hotel of India v. R.N. Kapoor, A.I.R. (1956) S.C. 1962).  
The question is not of words but of substance and the label which the parties choose to put upon the 
transaction though relevant is not decisive. 
(iii)  Formalities:  According to Section 107, a lease from year to year or for any term exceeding one year can 
be made only by a registered document. If a lease is  for a term below one year, it can be made by an oral 
agreement. If a lease is created by oral agreement, it must be accompanied by delivery of possession. If the 
EP-EBCL 
372 
lease is for a year or more, it must be effected by a registered document. If after the registration, the lessor 
does not give possession, the lessee can sue for possession. 
(iv)  Types of tenancies:  Following are the various types of tenancies: 
 
(a) Tenancy from year to year:  A tenancy from year to year may be made by a grant of land from year 
to year. If the tenancy is for a year to start with but after the expiration of one year the lessee 
continues to be in possession and pays the rent to the landlord, the tenancy is regarded as a year-
to-year tenancy. If, in case of a tenancy for a period more than a year the landlord wants to 
terminate or end the lease, he has to give a six-month’s notice to the lessee to quit. In case of a 
tenancy from month to month, a fifteen days notice to quit is necessary. The monthly tenancy may 
be created either by contract or may be presumed from the nature of the tenancy to be one, from 
month to month. 
 
(b) Tenancy-at-will:  Tenancy-at-will is a tenancy recognised by law. This comes into existence where a 
tenant holds over with the consent is let into occupation. We have stated above that if the tenant 
continues to be in possession after the expiration of tenancy and pays the rent to the landlord, the 
tenancy may be one from year to year or from month to month. During a period when the tenant is 
in possession after expiry of the period, if the tenant stays with the consent of the landlord till such 
time as further period is fixed or a fresh contract is made, the tenant is called a tenant-at-will. The 
landlord will decide for what further period shall the tenancy be given. ‘A tenancy-at-will is implied 
when a person is in possession by the consent of the owner and is not held in view of any tenancy 
for a certain time. The tenancy-at-will does not mean that the landlord has to give a proper notice to 
quit. The tenant-at-will cannot sublet during that period because no valid contract for further 
extension in his favour has been made. The death of the landlord or tenant determines the tenancy, 
i.e., the tenancy comes to an end. 
 
(c) A tenancy by sufferance:  This is a tenancy which is created by fiction of law. If a tenant continues 
to be in possession after the determination of the period of the lease without the consent of the 
landlord, he becomes a tenant by sufferance. A tenant-at-will is in possession with the consent of 
the landlord, whereas a tenant by sufferance is in possession without his permission after the term 
of the lease comes to an end. This type of tenant is not regarded as a trespasser because the 
tenant had in his favour a valid lease to start with. No notice is necessary to such a tenant for 
eviction. This tenant is not responsible for rent. He is liable to pay compensation for use and 
occupation of the land. 
(v) Requirements of a valid notice:  In order that a notice to quit is valid it must be a proper notice. The notice 
must convey the intention to terminate the tenancy as a whole and must specify the date on which the 
tenancy would expire. As mentioned earlier, if the lease is a lease from month to month, 15 days, notice is 
required. If it is from year to year 6 months’ notice is required. A lease of the moveable property for 
agricultural or manufacturing purposes shall be deemed to be a lease from year to year. The notice should 
expire with the end of the period of the tenancy. If it is a lease from month to month and the notice is given 
by the landlord, the tenant should be asked to quit at the end of the month of the tenancy. The landlord 
cannot ask his tenant to quit at any time before the expiry of a month or a year of the tenancy. 
 (vi)  Determination of leases:  Section 111 of the Transfer of Property Act spells out the various 
contingencies in which a lease comes to an end. A lease is determined, i.e., comes to an end in the following 
ways: 
 
(1) By efflux of time or lapse of time:  A lease for a definite period, such as a lease for a year, or for a 
term of years, expires on the last day of the term and the lessor or any person entitled to get back 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
373 
the property may enter without notice or any other formality. Since a lease is a transfer of interest in 
the property, if during the period for which a lease is valid, the lessee dies, the heirs of the lessee 
can continue the lease till the expiry of the period. 
 
(2) By the happening of a special event:  When a lease is granted subject to the happening of an event, 
it comes to an end when the event takes place. Thus, if B grants lease to A for life, it comes to an 
end on the death of A. Similarly, if a lease is granted for the duration of the war, it comes to an end 
when the war ends. Where the interest of the lessor is limited, the lease comes, to an end when he 
loses the interest or where he does not have any power to grant a lease. For example, a tenant for 
life can grant a lease only to last during his life time. It comes to an end on his death. 
 
(3) Merger:  A lease comes to an end when the lessee buys the property of the lessor or when the 
lessee takes the lessor’s interest by succession. Here the right of the lessee merges in that of the 
lessor. Naturally, the lessee becomes the owner of the property after he acquires it. So there will be 
no more a lease. 
 
(4) By surrender:  A lease may come to an end by surrender. Surrender may be either express or 
implied. Express surrender arises when the lessee yields up his interst under a lease by mutual 
consent. Implied surrender occurs, as follows :- if during the subsistence of the lease, a new lease 
is granted to the tenant to commence at once in substitution for the existing lease, it operates as a 
surrender of the old lease. For example, a lessee, accepts to take effect during the continuance of 
the existing lease. This is an implied surrender of the former lease and such lease comes to an end. 
Similarly, when the landlord reserves possession without any objection on the tenant’s part, there is 
a surrender by implication. Mere non-payment of rent does not amount to surrender. 
 
(5) By forfeiture:  A lease also comes to an end by forfeiture. A forfeiture occurs when there is breach of 
a condition in a lease contract by the lessee. Under the Transfer of Property Act, forfeiture occurs in 
the following circumstances—the first case in which forfeiture occurs is the case when the lessee 
breaks an express condition which may be of various types such as, if the lessee does not pay the 
rent regularly, or if the lessee becomes insolvent, or where the lessee sublets the property to 
another person. In all such cases there will be a forfeiture. But the condition that the lessee breaks 
must be an express condition which must have been incorporated in the contract of lease. Then 
only the lessor can re-enter the leased property and claim that the lease shall be forfeited. 
In the case of a forfeiture due to default in payment of the rent, if the lessor sues the lessee to quit, the Court 
can direct the lessee to pay the rent or arrears of rent and continue the lease. But in a breach of any other 
condition, such as the breach of a condition preventing the lessee from subletting the property, the Court will 
not help the lessee if he breaks the condition. He will incur forfeiture. A breach of condition by the lessee 
gives an option to the lessor to bring the lease to an end. But if he does not exercise the option the lease will 
continue validly. The lessee, however, cannot on breaking the condition, take advantage of his wrong and 
terminate the lease. 
The second case of forfeiture occurs when the tenant denies the title of the landlord and claims that 
somebody else or he himself is the owner of the property. In order that a denial of the landlord’s title should 
work as a forfeiture of the lease, three things are necessary: 
 
(a) the tenant must set up title either in himself or in a third-party; 
 
(b) the denial must be direct and not casual; 
 
(c) it must be made known to the landlord. 
 (vii)  Duties of the Lessor:  Following are some of the duties of the lessor: 
EP-EBCL 
374 
 
(a) The lessor is bound to disclose to the lessee any material defect in the property with reference to its 
intended use of which the lessor is and the lessee is not aware. This rule applies only to physical 
defects of the property such as the condition and the nature of the property leased. You will note 
that the lessor is not bound to disclose whether or not he has title to the property. 
 
(b) The next duty of the lessor is to put the lessee in possession of the property. A lease is a transfer of 
possession the consideration being rent and, therefore, it follows that the landlord cannot recover 
the rent unless he has delivered possession to the tenant. If a contract of lease has been executed 
and the lessor does not give possession of the property to the lessee, the lessee can sue the lessor 
for possession. 
 
(c) The next duty that is cast on the lessor is what is usually called convenant for quiet enjoyment. The 
covenant, that is the right to undisturbed possession, so long as the lessee pays the rent, 
presupposes possession and, therefore, no action can be brought on this convenant unless the 
lessee has first obtained possession. The covenant for possession gives the lessee the right to 
obtain possession; the covenant for quiet enjoyment gives the lessee a right to continue in such 
possession. If the lessee’s possession is disturbed, he can sue for damages or, in case a part of the 
leased property is taken possession of either by the lessor or by any third-party; the lessee can hold 
a part of the leased property and pay a proportionate rent. 
(viii)  Duties of the lessee:  The lessee has the following duties: 
 
(a) The lessee is bound to disclose to the lessor any fact as to nature or extent of the interest that the 
lessee is about to take, of which the lessee is, and the lessor is not aware and which materially 
increases the value of such interest. 
 
(b) The lessee is bound to pay or tender at the proper time and place, the premium or rent to the lessor 
or his agent in this behalf. We have already seen that in case the lessee does not pay the rent, he 
may incur forfeiture of the tenancy. The liability to pay the rent commences from the date the tenant 
is put into possession. 
 
(c) The next duty of the lessee is that he uses the property as a person of ordinary prudence would 
make use of. But he shall not permit another person to use the property for purposes other than that 
for which it was leased. 
 
(d) He should not do any act which is destructive of or permanently injurious to the property. 
 
(e)  The lessee must not, without the lessor’s consent, erect on the property any permanent structure 
except for agricultural purpose. If he wants to erect certain fixtures or chattel on the leased property, 
it must be done without causing any damage to the property. Before the termination of the lease, he 
can remove all the things attached to the earth. If permanent fixtures are to be made, the lessee 
must obtain the consent of the landlord. 
 
(f) If the lessee comes to know of any proceedings by way of suit to recover the property of the lessor, 
the lessee should immediately inform the lessor. Since, the tenant is in possession of the property 
he is the person who is not likely to know of any encroachment on the landlord’s property and he 
should therefore inform the landlord. 
 
(g) The lessee should hand over the property at the end of the lease. 
(ix)  Rights of the lessee:  The lessee enjoys the following rights: 
 
(a) If during the continuance of the lease any accession is made to the property, such accession is 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
375 
deemed to be comprised in the lease, the lessee has a right to enjoy the accretions of the leased 
property. 
 
(b) Where, under the contract, the landlord has agreed to repair the property, the lessee can carry out 
the repairs and deduct the expenses from the rent if the landlord fails to do so. 
 
(c) If the lessee has made payment which the lessor is bound by law to pay such as payment of 
Government revenues or municipal taxes on the property, the lessee can deduct the amount from 
the rent and pay the balance to the lessor. He can even take interest on the amount he has paid. 
 
(d) The lessee has a right to remove the fixtures he has erected-during the term of the lease. 
 
(e) If, due to no fault of his, the lease comes to an end (i.e., when the lease is of uncertain duration), 
the lessee or his legal representatives are entitled to all the crops planted or grown by the lessee. 
The lessee or his representatives have got a right to come and carry away the crops, etc., which are 
growing on the land. If the lease is of a definite period, such a right cannot be claimed, particularly, 
when lessee has committed a fault, e.g., where he has committed a breach of a condition entailing 
forfeiture. 
 
(f) The lessee may avoid the lease, if property is wholly or partly destroyed by tempest, flood, or fire so 
as to make it impossible to continue the lease for the purpose for which it was let. 
 
(g) The lessee has right to transfer absolutely or by way of mortgage or sub-lease, the whole or any 
part of his interest in the property. We have also noticed that the lessee’s rights are transferable. 
 
5.  Actionable Claims 
"Actionable claim" has been dealt with under Sections 130 to 137 of the Act. 
 
(i) Definition: "Actionable claim" is defined in Section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act as follows: 
 
 A claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immoveable property or by 
hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in moveable property not 
in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the Civil courts recognize as 
affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing, 
conditional or contingent. 
Actionable claims are claims, to unsecured debts. If a debt is secured by the mortgage of immoveable 
property it is not an actionable claim, because the Section clearly excludes such a debt. A debt is a 
liquidated money obligation which is usually recoverable by a suit. To create a debt, first of all, there must be 
a liquidated or definite sum which is actually due. For example, arrears of rent due. The term debt may also 
include a sum of money which is due in the sense that it exists, but is not actually payable until a later date. 
For example, A borrows money from B on the 1st of January and promises to repay on March 15, the 
amount is not payable till the 15th of March, but certainly it is a debt and it is an accruing debt. Another 
essential of an actionable claim is that it is not in possession of a person and the person can claim such a 
debt by bringing an action in a Court of law. 
The Section also says that it must be a claim to any debt which the Civil Courts recognise as affording 
grounds for relief to the person who claims it. 
Illustrations of actionable claims: 
 
(i) Arrears of rent accrual constitute a ‘debt’ so it is an actionable claim (Sheu Gobind Singh v. Gauri 
Prasad, AIR 1925 Pat. 310). 
EP-EBCL 
376 
 
(ii) Provident Fund that is standing to the credit of a member of the Provident Fund. 
 
(iii) Money due under the Insurance Policy. 
 
(iv) A partner’s right to sue for accounts of dissolved partnership is an actionable claim being a 
beneficial interest in moveable property not in possession (Thakardas v. Vishindas). 
Non-actionable claims 
 
(i) Debentures are secured debts and therefore not regarded as actionable claims. 
 
(ii) Copy right though a beneficial interest in immoveable property is not an actionable claim 
since the owner has actual or constructive possession of the same (Savitri Devi v. Dwarka 
Bhatya, (1939) All 305). 
Again, an actionable claim includes a beneficial interest in the moveable property not in possession. Now, a 
benefit of a contract for the purchase of goods is a beneficial interest in moveable property. 
6.  Mortgages  
Sections 58 to 104 of the Act deal with "Mortgages". 
Definition and nature of mortgage:   
According to Section 58 of the Transfer of Property Act, a "mortgage" is the transfer of an interest in specific 
immoveable property for the purpose of securing the payment of money advanced or to be advanced by way 
of loan, an existing or future debt or the performance of an engagement which may give rise to pecuniary 
liability. 
The transferor is called a mortgagor, the transferee a mortgagee. The principal money and interest the 
payment of which is secured for the time being are called the mortgage money and the instrument by which 
the transfer is effected is called a mortgage deed. 
Essentials of a mortgage: 
 
(1) Transfer of interest:  The first thing to note is that a mortgage is a transfer of interest in the specific 
immoveable property. The mortgagor as an owner of the property is possessed of all the interests in 
it, and when he mortgages the property to secure a loan, he only parts with an interest in that 
property in favour of the mortgagor. After mortgage, the interest of the mortgagor is reduced by the 
interest which has been transferred to the mortgagee. His ownership has become less for the time 
being by the interest which he has parted with in favour of the mortgagee. If the mortgagor transfers 
this property, the transferee gets it subject to the right of the mortgagor to recover from it what is 
due to him, i.e., the principal plus interest. 
 
(2) Specific immoveable property:  The second point is that the property must be specifically mentioned 
in the mortgage deed. Where, for instance, the mortgagor stated “all of my property” in the 
mortgage deed, it was held by the Court that this was not a mortgage. The reason why the 
immoveable property must be distinctly and specifically mentioned in the mortgage deed is that, in 
case the mortgagor fails to repay the loan the Court is in a position to grant a decree for the sale of 
any particular property in a suit by the mortgagee. 
 
(3) To secure the payment of a loan:  Another characteristic of a mortgage is that the transaction is for 
the purpose of securing the payment of a loan for the performance of an obligation which may give 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
377 
rise to pecuniary liability. It may be for the purpose of obtaining a loan, or if a loan has already been 
granted to secure the repayment of such loan. There is thus a debt and the relationship between the 
mortgagor and the mortgagee is that of debtor and creditor. When A borrows 100 bags of paddy 
and further quantity by way of interest, it is mortgage transaction for the performance of an 
obligation. 
Where, however, a person borrows money and agrees with the creditor that till the debt is repaid he will not 
alienate his property, the transaction does not amount to a mortgage. Here the person merely says that he 
will not transfer his property till he has repaid the debt; he does not transfer any interest in the property to the 
creditor. In sale as distinguished from a mortgage, all the interest or rights of ownership are transferred to the 
purchaser. In a mortgage, as stated earlier, only part of the interests are transferred to the mortgagee, some 
of them remaining vested in the mortgagor. 
  
To sum up, it may be stated that there are three outstanding characteristics of a mortgage: 
(a) the mortgagee’s interest in the property mortgaged terminates upon the performance of 
the obligation secured by the Mortgage. 
 
(b) the mortgagor has a right of foreclosure upon the mortgagor’s failure to perform. 
 
(c) the mortgagor has a right to redeem or regain the property on repayment of the debt or performance 
of the obligation. 
 
Form of a mortgage contract:   
According to Section 59, where the principal money secured is Rs. 100 or upwards, a mortgage, other than a 
mortgage by deposit of title-deeds, can be effected only by a registered instrument or by delivery of property. 
It should be noted that a mortgage is not a mere contract but it is the Conveyance of Interest in the 
mortgaged property and as soon as the mortgage deed is registered an interest in the property vests in the 
mortgagee. 
Kinds of mortgages:  
 There are in all six kinds of mortgages in immoveable property, namely 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Simple mortgage 
Anomalous 
mortgage 
Mortgage by 
deposit of title 
deeds or equitable 
mortgage 
Mortgage 
by 
conditional sale 
Usufractuary 
mortgage 
English mortgage 
EP-EBCL 
378 
(a)  Simple mortgage 
In a simple mortgage, the mortgagor binds himself personally to pay the debt and agrees in the event of his 
failure to pay the mortgage money, the mortgagee shall have the right to cause the property to be applied so 
far as may be necessary by means of a decree for the sale of property. If the mortgaged property is not 
sufficient to discharge the debt, the mortgagee can bring a personal action against the mortgagor and obtain 
a decree which, like any other money decree, can be executed against other properties of the mortgagor. In 
simple mortgage, no right of possession or foreclosure is available to the mortgagee. 
(b)  Mortgage by conditional sale 
In this type of mortgage, the property is mortgaged with a condition super added that in the event of a failure 
by the debtor to repay the debt at the stipulated time, the transaction should be regarded a sale, and in case 
the loan is repaid at the stipulated time, the sale shall be invalid, or on condition that on such payment being 
made the buyer shall transfer the property to the seller. 
Thus, for all practical purposes, this type of mortgage is ostensible sale of the mortgaged property with a 
condition for re-purchase by the mortgagor by repaying the loan. It will be noted that the mortgagor transfers 
the property with the following three conditions: 
 
(a) If the loan is repaid, the sale becomes void. 
 
(b) If the loan is not repaid at the stipulated time, the sale will become absolute and binding. 
 
(c) When the debt has been repaid at the stipulated time, the mortgagee shall re-transfer the property 
to the mortgagor. 
 
 In case of mortgage by conditional sale, there is no personal covenant. That is unlike in the case of 
a simple mortgage, the mortgagor in this case does not bind himself personally to repay the debt. 
The mortgagee is not given the possession of the property in this type of mortgage. This is also the 
position in the case of a simple mortgage. Again, in a mortgage by conditional sale, the mortgagee’s 
remedy is ‘foreclosure’, that is he becomes the owner of the property in default of payment of the 
debt by the mortgagor, he has to institute a regular suit in a Court of law to "foreclose" the 
mortgage. To "foreclose" means to debar the mortgagor from redeeming the property forever. 
(c)  Usufructuary mortgage 
Section 58(d) defines a "usufructuary mortgage" as “where the mortgagor delivers possession or expressly 
or by implication binds himself to deliver possession of the mortgaged property to the mortgagee, and 
authorises him to retain such possession until payment of the mortgage money, and to receive the rents and 
profits accruing from the property or any part of such rents and profits and to appropriate the same in lieu of 
interest, or in payment of the mortgage money, or partly in lieu of interest or partly in payment of the 
mortgage money, the transaction is called an usufractuary mortgage. It is also called a mortgage with 
possession. 
Thus is this type of mortgage the mortgagor has to deliver possession of the property to the mortgagee. If the 
possession is not given, the mortgagee can sue for possession. The mere fact that possession has not been 
delivered will not alter the nature of the transaction. In Pratap Bahadur v. Gajadhar, 24 All 521, it was agreed 
that the mortgagee will put the mortgagor in possession of a village on a certain date and to pay interest till 
possession was delivered. It was held that mortgage was an usufructuary mortgage. The mortgagee is 
authorised to retain possession and receive rents, etc., until he recovers the whole debt and the interest. The 
usufructuary mortgagee has to look only to the profits that arise out of the property for realising his debt; 
there is no personal liability on the part of the mortgagor. Similarly, the mortgagee has no right to foreclose 
the mortgage or to sue for sale. 
A mortgage may be regarded as usufructuary even though the entire debt is not to be paid out of the profits 
of the property. Therefore, a usufructuary mortgage may be either (i) where the entire mortgage money is to 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
379 
be paid from the profit of the land; or (ii) where only part of the mortgage money is principal or interest 
amount is to be paid from the profit of the land. 
If in a usufructuary mortgage a time is mentioned during which the mortgagee should recover the debt, etc., 
then after the time is over, the mortgagee should deliver back the property to the mortgagor. He cannot 
refuse to give back the property, if he has not been able to recover the debt and the interest, etc. A 
usufructuary mortgagee is supposed to remain in possession of the mortgaged property and manage the 
same as a person of ordinary prudence would manage subject to the conditions of mortgage agreement. Any 
loss due to failure on his part would be debited to his account (Panchanan Sharma v. B.P. Jagnani, SCALE 
1995 (2) 641). 
Thus, a usufructuary mortgage has the following characteristics: 
 
1. Possession of property must be delivered to the mortgagee; 
 
2. There is no personal liability on the part of the mortgagor to pay; 
 
3. The mortgagee is entitled to rents and profits in lieu of interest or principal or both; and 
 
4. The mortgagee however is not entitled to foreclose the mortgagee or to sue for sale. 
(d)  English mortgage 
Section 58(e) states that: “where the mortgagor binds himself to repay the mortgage money on a certain 
date, and transfers the mortgaged property absolutely to the mortgagee but subject to a proviso that he will 
retransfer it to the mortgagor upon payment of the money as agreed, the transaction is called an English 
mortgage”. 
Here the mortgagor transfers the ownership of the property as security and the mortgagee promises to re-
transfer the ownership, if the money is paid within a definite time. There is also a personal covenant as the 
mortgagor promises to repay within a certain date. In this type of mortgage, there is proviso that if money is 
repaid the property would be reconveyed. The remedy of the mortgagee is sale of the property to recover the 
debt. Thus, the essential features of an English mortgage are as under: 
 
1. The mortgagor binds himself to repay the mortgage money on a certain day. In other words, there 
should be a personal undertaking to pay. 
 
2. The mortgaged property is absolutely transferred to the mortgagee. 
 
3. Such absolute transfer is subject to a proviso that the mortgagee will reconvey the property to the 
mortgagor upon payment by him of the mortgage money on the fixed day. 
Distinction between English mortgage and mortgage by conditional sale 
An English mortgage looks like a mortgage by conditional sale but there are obvious differences between the 
two: 
 
1. In English mortgage there is a personal liability undertaken by the mortgagor to pay the debt. In a 
mortgage by conditional sale there is no personal covenant (agreement for payment of the 
mortgage money and mortgagee has his remedy against the mortgaged property only; 
 
2. In English mortgage the ownership in the mortgaged property is absolutely transferred to the creditor 
(i.e. mortgagee) which however, may be divested on repayment of the loan on the fixed day. 
In a mortgage by conditional sale, the mortgagee gets only a qualified ownership which may, however, ripen 
into an absolute ownership in default of payment of the mortgage money. 
 (e)  Mortgage by deposit of title deeds 
This type of mortgage is called equitable mortgage in English law. In this transaction, a person delivers to the 
EP-EBCL 
380 
creditor or his agent documents of title of his immoveable property with an intention to create a security, and 
obtains a loan. The requisites of such a mortgage are (i) a debt, (ii) deposit of title deeds, and (iii) an 
intention that the deeds shall be security for the debt. 
In order that a valid mortgage on an immoveable property should be effected, it must be in writing and 
attested by two witnesses and the document must be registered. But in case of a mortgage by deposit of title 
deeds, it need not be registered and an oral agreement between the person and the creditor followed by the 
delivery of the documents of title to the property is enough. The creditor will have the possession of the 
documents and he will advance the money at the stipulated rate of interest. In case the mortgagor does not 
repay the loan, the creditor on the basis of having the title deeds in his possession can sue the debtor to 
recover the money. This type of mortgage has been recognized due to expediency. Many persons, specially 
the business people, may need money urgently and they cannot wait till a formal document is written, signed, 
attested and then registered. So they will simply approach the creditor and hand over the title deeds of their 
property and borrow money. This avoids delay and other formalities for effecting a valid mortgage. 
There must be a clear intention on the part of the person who hands over the title deeds to effect a valid 
mortgage. In the absence of any intention, the mere holding in possession of the title deeds will not create a 
valid mortgage. 
The term ‘documents of title’ or title deeds means such documents as will show prima facie or apparent title 
to the property of the person who is borrowing money. Accordingly, in one case it was held that tax receipt 
was not a document of title to the property on which the tax was paid. What is necessary to deposit is a 
document which gives him his right to the property and the creditor should insist on the production of this 
document before he gives money on a pledge of documents. 
It should be noted that this type of mortgage can be created only in certain towns and not everywhere in 
India. The facility to create a valid mortgage is available in the following towns in India: Calcutta, Madras, 
Bombay, Adoni, Ajmer, Allahabad, Alwar, Bangalore, Bellary, Cochin, Coimbatore, Delhi, Jaipur, Jodhpur, 
Kanpur, Rajahmundry, Udaipur, Vellor, Ellora, Pali, Bhilwara, Bikaner, Kakinada, Narayanganj, Mysore, and 
Madurai. Though this type of mortgage is limited to specific cities it is at par with any other legal mortgage 
(K.J. Nathan v. S.V. Maruthi Rao, A.I.R. 1965 S.C. 443). 
Title deeds should be delivered in these areas, the property of the person may be situated elsewhere. If the 
deposit of title deeds has taken place in any other town, it will not be a valid mortgage. Similarly, if the 
property is situated in any one of the towns mentioned above, but the deposit of title deeds is made in other 
towns or areas then again it will not be a valid mortgage. 
(f)  Anomalous mortgage 
Section 58(g) of the Transfer of Property Act provides that “a mortgage which is not a simple mortgage, a 
mortgage by conditional sale, usufructuary mortgage, an English mortgage, or a mortgage by deposit of title 
deeds within the meaning of this section is called an anomalous mortgage”. 
Thus, an anomalous mortgage is a combination of various other mortgages, for example, a usufructuary 
mortgage may be created and the mortgagee shall have the right of sale. You have already noticed that in a 
usufructuary mortgage only possession is given to the mortgagee and there is no right of sale. But in an 
anomalous mortgage the right of sale along with the possession of the property may be given. You have also 
seen that in the case of usufructuary mortgage, there is no personal liability on the part of a mortgagor but if 
the mortgagor assumes personal liability to pay the mortgage money, it will be an anomalous mortgage. 
Again, a mortgagee may be given possession of the property for a fixed period with a condition that in case 
the debt is not discharged at the expiry of the period mentioned, the mortgage shall be regarded as a 
mortgage by conditional sale. In this case, the mortgage has got a right of "foreclosure" and after the expiry 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
381 
of the period if the debt is not paid, the mortgagee will become the owner of the property. 
Two other terms in common use in connection with mortgage may be considered here. These terms are (i) 
Sub-mortgage; and (ii) Puisne mortgage. 
Sub-mortgage:  
Where the mortgagee transfers by mortgage his interest in the mortgaged property, or creates a mortgage of 
a mortgage the transaction is known as a sub-mortgage. For example, where A mortgages his house to B for 
Rs. 10,000 and B mortgage his mortgagee right to C for Rs. 8,000. B creates a sub-mortgage. 
Puisne mortgage:  
Where the mortgagor, having mortgaged his property, mortgages it to another person to secure another loan, 
the second mortgage is called a puisne mortgage. For example, where A mortgages his house worth ` one 
lakh to B for `40,000 and mortgages the same house to C for a further sum of `30,000, the mortgage to B is 
first mortgage and that to C the second or puisne mortgage. C is the puisne mortgagee, and can recover the 
debt subject to the right of B, the first mortgagee, to recover his debt of `40,000 plus interest. 
Rights of mortgagor:   
By mortgaging the property the mortgagor does not cease to be its owner, he only transfers an interest in it. 
The law, therefore, grants him the following rights: 
 
(a) Right of redemption:  The first and the most important right of the mortgagor is the right to redeem 
i.e., take back the mortgaged property by paying the mortgage money at any time after the 
stipulated date for repayment. Section 60 of the Act provides that any time after the principal 
amount has become due, the mortgagor has a right to redeem the property. Although the Act gives 
him the right to redeem “any time” after their debt has become due, it enjoins upon the mortgagor 
the obligation to exercise this right (i) before the right is extinguished by the Act of parties or by a 
decree of Court, or (ii) before it is barred by the Limitation Act. According to the Law of Limitation 
the, mortgagor can redeem the property within 60 years after the money has become due. This right 
to redeem the property even after the time of payment has elapsed is called the Right of Equity or 
Redemption. But the mortgagor is not entitled to redeem before the mortgage money becomes due 
on the date fixed for repayment of the loan. His right to redeem arises only when mortgage money 
becomes due and not before. 
 
(b) Right against clog on equity of redemption: Right of redemption or equity of redemption is the essence 
of a mortgage, and any provision inserted in the mortgage deed to prevent, evade or hamper 
redemption is void. Any condition which prevents the mortgagor from redeeming the property is called 
a “clog” on the equity or right of redemption and is void. The rule of equity that once a mortgage 
always a mortgage prohibits a clog on the right of redemption. In other words, once a transaction is 
found to be a mortgage, the Court would not permit any condition in a mortgage deed which would 
prevent or impede redemption or repayment of the loan for which the security was given.  
 
(c) Right of partial redemption: A mortgage, as a rule, being one and indivisible for the debt and every 
part of it, the mortgagor cannot redeem piecemeal; he must redeem the whole property. But Section 
61 of the Act gives a right of partial redemption stating that “a mortgagor who has executed two or 
more mortgages in favour of the same mortgagee shall, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, 
when the principal money of any two or more of the mortgages has become due, be entitled to 
redeem any one such mortgage separately or any two or more of such mortgages together.” 
Implied contract by mortgagor: 
The parties are free to enter into any terms they like. Where, however, the contract does not contain all the 
EP-EBCL

terms, Section 65 provides for implied terms as follows: 
In the absence of a contract to the contrary, the mortgagor shall be deemed to have contracted with the 
mortgagee that the: 
 
(a) mortgagor is entitled to transfer the interest (covenant for title); 
 
(b) mortgagor will assist the mortgagee to enjoy quiet possession; 
 
(c) mortgagor will pay public charges in respect of the mortgaged property; 
 
(d) mortgagor covenants as to payment of the rent due on lease where, the mortgaged property is 
leased; 
 
(e) mortgagor covenants as to payment of interest and principal on prior encumbrances, where the 
mortgage is a second or subsequent encumbrance on the property. 
Rights of mortgagee and his remedies:   
If the mortgagor does not pay the mortgage money, the mortgagee may proceed to recover (i) from the 
mortgaged property, or (ii) sue for recovery from the mortgagor personally. Thus the mortgagor has two 
remedies: one against the property and the other against the mortgagor personally. 
7.  Charges 
Meaning of charge:  "Charge" has been defined under Section 100 as follows:  “Where immoveable property 
of one person is by the act of parties or operation of law made security for the payment of money to another, 
and the transaction does not amount to a mortgage, the latter person is said to have a charge on the 
property”. 
As is evident from the above definition, a charge comes into existence either by the act of parties or by 
operation of law. 
Charge by act of parties:  When in a transaction for value, both the parties (debtor and creditor) intend that 
the property existing or future shall be made available as security for the payment of a debt and that the 
creditor shall have a present right to have it made available, there is a charge. 
Charge by Operation of Law: Charges created by law are those which arise on account of some statutory 
provisions. They are not created by the voluntary action of parties but arise as a result of some legal 
obligation. 
Floating charge: A charge may be floating as well as fixed. A fixed charge is a charge on specific property 
but a floating charge is an equitable charge on the assets for time being of a going concern. It is peculiar to 
companies which are able to borrow money without any interference with their assets so long as they are 
going concern. In other words, it is a charge on a class of the assets of the company, present as well as 
future. The assets of the company are constantly undergoing a change but the creditors will not normally 
interfere with the assets of the company unless there is breach of some condition. As Professor Gower says, 
the assets are liquid and the charge is floating. It is ambulatory and shifting in its nature hovering over and so 
to speak floating with the property which it is intended to effect. As it does not attach to any specific property, 
it remains document until it crystallises. 
A floating charge has the following characteristics: 
 
1. It is a charge on class of assets both present and future. 
 
2. The class of assets charged is one which in the ordinary course of business would be changing 
from time to time. 
 
3. It is contemplated by the charge that until some future step is taken by those who are interested in 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
383 
the charge the company may carry on its business in the ordinary way, i.e., it may use its assets 
charged in the ordinary course of its business. (Per Roman L.J. in Reyork Shive Wool Combers 
Associated Limited, (1903) 2 Ch. 284) A floating charge is created by debentures on the company’s 
undertaking or its estate, property and effects. It is not necessary that the charge should be on all 
company’s assets. Thus a mortgage of a cinema and of the chattels used in the cinema premises 
was held to be a floating charge as to the chattles (National Provisional Bank of England Limited v. 
Charteb Electric Theatres Limited, (1916) Ch. 132). Similarly, a floating charge was created by a 
mortgage of book and other debts which shall become due during the continuance of this security 
(Reyork Shive Wool Combers Association, Supra). 
Crystallisation of floating charge 
A floating charge becomes fixed or crystallises in the following cases: 
 
1. When the money becomes payable under a condition in the debenture and the debenture holder, 
(i.e., the creditor) takes some steps to enforce the security; 
 
2. When the company ceases to carry on business; and 
 
3. When the company is being wound-up. 
  
8.  Distinction between Mortgage and Charge 
Although in a charge, the property is made a security for the payment of the loan, yet the transaction does 
not amount to mortgage. It is important, therefore to distinguish between a charge and mortgage. 
 
(a) A mortgage is transfer of an interest in the property made by the mortgagor as a security for the 
loan, while the charge is not the transfer of any interest in the property though it is security for the 
payment of an amount. 
 
(b) A charge may be created by act of parties or by operation of law. A mortgage can only be created 
by act of parties. 
 
(c) A mortgage deed must be registered and attested by two witnesses, while a charge need not be 
made in writing, and if reduced to writing, it need not be attested or registered. 
 
(d) In certain types of mortgage (viz., mortgage by conditional sale and anomalous mortgage) the 
mortgagor can foreclose the mortgaged property but in charge, the charge-holder cannot foreclose 
though he can get the property sold as in a simple mortgage. 
 
(e) From the very nature of it, a charge as a general rule, cannot be enforced against a transferee for 
consideration without notice. But in a mortgage, the transferee of mortgaged property from the mortgagor, 
can only acquire the remaining interest of the mortgagor, and is therefore, only bound by the mortgage. 
 
(f) In a charge created by act of parties the specification of the particular fund or property negatives a 
personal liability and the remedy of the charge-holder is against the property only. In a mortgage, 
there can be security as well as personal liability. In fact, the absence of a personal liability is the 
principal test that distinguishes a charge from a simple mortgage. 
 
LESSON ROUND-UP 
• The law relating to transfer of property is governed by the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. ‘Transfer of 
Property’ means an act by which a living person conveys property, in present or future, to one or more 
EP-EBCL 
384 
other living persons, or to himself, and one or more other living persons. ‘living person’ includes a company 
or association or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not. 
• Every person who is competent to contract and entitled to transferable property, or authorized to dispose of 
property is competent to transfer such property. Property can be transferred either orally or by writing. 
Moveable property can be transferred by delivery of possession or by registration. In the case of tangible 
immoveable property of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards, or in the case of a reversion or 
other intangible thing, transfer can be made only by a registered instrument. In the case of tangible 
immoveable property of a value less than one hundred rupees, such transfer may be made either by a 
registered instrument or by delivery of the property. 
• When property is transferred, the transferee should not be restrained absolutely from alienating the 
property. One may give property to another subject to a condition, but the condition should not be one 
which absolutely prevents the transferee from alienating the property. A transfer may also be made subject 
to a contingency which may or may not occur. This is known as condition subsequent. Condition 
subsequent is one which destroys or divests the rights upon the happening or non-happening of an event.  
• Section 35 of the Transfer of Property Act deals with what is called doctrine of election. Election may be 
defined as “the choosing between two rights where there is a clear intention that both were not intended to 
be enjoyed”. The foundation of doctrine of election is that a person taking the benefit of an instrument must 
also bear the burden, and he must not take under and against the same instrument. 
• Where, with the consent, express of implied, of the persons interested in immoveable property, a person is 
the ostensible owner of such property and transfers the same for consideration, the transfer shall not be 
voidable on the ground that the transferor was not authorized to make it, provided that the transferee, after 
taking reasonable care to ascertain that the transferor had power to make the transfer, has acted in good 
faith. This is called doctrine of Holding Out. 
• Doctrine of Feeding the Grant by Estoppel means where, a person fraudulently or erroneously represents 
that he is authorized to transfer certain immoveable property and professes to transfer such property for 
consideration, such transfer shall, at the option of the transferee, operate on any interest which the 
transferor may acquire in such property at any time during which the contract of transfer subsists. 
• Where a person transfers his property so that his creditors shall not have anything out of the property, the 
transfer is called a fraudulent transfer. A debtor in order to defeat or delay the rights of a creditor, may 
transfer his property to some person, who may be his relative or a friend. The law does not allow this. 
• The Act does not allow accumulation of income from the land for an unlimited period without the income-
being enjoyed by owner of the property. The law allows accumulation of income for a certain period only. 
The period for which such accumulation is valid is : (a) the life of the transferor, or (b) eighteen years from 
the date of transfer. Any direction to accumulate the income beyond the period mentioned above is void. 
However, this is subject to certain exceptions. 
• Lis pendens means a pending suit, action, petition or the like. Section 52 of the T.P. Act incorporates the 
doctrine of Lis pendens. It states that during the pendency of a suit in a court of law, property which is 
subject to a litigation cannot be transferred. 
• The Act expressly provides for special types of transfers such as sale, exchange, gift, mortgage and lease. 
In a sale, exchange and gift, there is a transfer of the ownership of property but mortgage is a transfer of an 
interest in specific immovable property and lease is a transfer of the right to enjoy immoveable property. 
• Actionable claims are claims, to unsecured debts. If a debt is secured by the mortgage of immoveable 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
385 
property it is not an actionable claim, because the section clearly excludes such a debt. 
• Charge under the Act has been defined as “where immoveable property of one person is by the act of 
parties or operation of law made security for the payment of money to another, and the transaction does not 
amount to a mortgage, the latter person is said to have a charge on the property”. 
• As is evident from the above definition, a charge comes into existence either by the act of parties or by 
operation of law. A charge may be floating as well as fixed. A fixed charge is a charge on specific property 
but a floating charge is an equitable charge on the assets for time being of a going concern. It is peculiar to 
companies which are able to borrow money without any interference with their assets so long as they are 
going concerns.

INTRODUCTION 
Real estate sector plays a catalytic role in fulfilling the needs and demand for housing and infrastructure in 
the country and is an important pillar of the economy. While this sector has grown significantly in recent 
years, it has been largely unregulated, with absence of professionalism and standardisation and lack of 
adequate consumer protection. It has no sectoral regulator like there are for other specific sectors like 
insurance, telecom, stock markets etc. History is witness to the fact that whenever sectoral regulators like 
SEBI, IRDAI, TRAI etc have been formed, they have helped in deepening the market and made it more 
robust. Though the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is available as a forum to the buyers in the real estate 
market, the recourse is only curative and is not adequate to address all the concerns of buyers and 
promoters in that sector. The lack of standardisation has been a constraint to the healthy and orderly growth 
of industry. Therefore, since more than a decade the need for regulating the sector was being emphasised in 
various forums. 
In view of the above, Parliament enacted the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 which 
aims at protecting the rights and interests of consumers and promotion of uniformity and standardization of 
business practices and transactions in the real estate sector. It attempts to balance the interests of 
consumers and promoters by imposing certain responsibilities on both. It seeks to establish symmetry of 
information between the promoter and purchaser, transparency of contractual conditions, set minimum 
standards of accountability and a fast-track dispute resolution mechanism. 
This Act will be put in operation just like the Motor Vehicles Act passed by the Central Government, pursuant 
to which respective State Governments (“SG”) and Union Territories (‘UT”) are required to notify their own 
Rules, which would be in the lines of the Central Act and accordingly administer their own State Rules. 
Accordingly, every SG and UT are to required to promulgate their own Real Estate Rules which would be 
based on the lines of the central Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act 2016, and establish a Real 
Estate Regulatory Authority (“RERA”) pursuant to the Rules, which will administer the respective Real Estate 
Rules of the State or UT. State Governements and UTs were required to notify and enforce RERA by 1st 
May 2017, which was the deadline set by the the Central Government. But a few State Governements have 
missed the deadline of 1st May 2017. It is expected that most of the State Governments would meet the 
second deadline of 31st July 2017, by which the ongoing projects are to be registered with RERA. 
The objects and reasons for which the Act has been framed are:

REGISTRATION OF REAL ESTATE PROJECT AND REGISTRATION OF REAL ESTATE 
AGENTS 
Many developers across India follow a common practice of pre-lauching a project without securing requisite 
approvals for the project from the local authorities, which is termed as “soft launch”, “pre-launch” etc. Buyers 
also lap into this opportunity as they get discounted prices during the pre-launches period. But if it is from a 
developer who is unscrupulous or a fly by night operator, then it carries a great risk. Hence, to plug this gap, 
registration of every project with the regulatory authority has been mandatory before it is launched for sale 
and for registration the basic pre-requisite is that the developer must have all the requisite approvals. Thus 
the buyer is protected as the project is ring-fenced from the vagaries of non-approvals or delays in approvals 
which are one of the major causes of delay for the project. The gist of relevant provisions for registration as 
ascribed in sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Act are stated below: 
Prior Registration of Real Estate project with Real Estate Regulatory Authority 
A promoter shall not advertise, market, book, sell or offer for sale, or invite persons to purchase in any 
EP-EBCL 
396 
manner any plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, in any real estate project or part of it, in any 
planning area, without registering the real estate project with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority 
established. 
The projects that are ongoing on the date of commencement of this Act and for which the completion 
certificate has not been issued, the promoter shall make an application to the Authority for registration of the 
said project within a period of three months from the date of commencement of this Act. 
Authority in the interest of allottees, for projects which are developed beyond the planning area but with the 
requisite permission of the local authority, it may, by order, direct the promoter of such project to register with 
the Authority, and the provisions of this Act or the rules and regulations made there under, shall apply to 
such projects from that stage of registration where the real estate project is to be developed in phases, every 
such phase shall be considered a stand alone real estate project, and the promoter shall obtain registration 
under this Act for each phase separately. 
Projects exempt from the ambit of the Act 
The following projects do not require to be registered under the Act: 
 
1. Area of land does not exceed 500 Sq. Meters

commencement of this Act;

concerned with the development of the proposed project; 
 
(l) a declaration, supported by an affidavit, which shall be signed by the promoter or any person 
authorised by the promoter, stating:— 
 
(A) that he has a legal title to the land on which the development is proposed along with legally 
valid documents with authentication of such title, if such land is owned by another person; 
 
(B) that the land is free from all encumbrances, or as the case may be details of the encumbrances

The promoter shall withdraw the amounts from the separate account, to cover the cost of the project, in 
proportion to the percentage of completion of the project. The amounts from the separate account shall be 
withdrawn by the promoter after it is certified by an engineer, an architect and a chartered accountant in

such other documents as may be prescribed by the rules or regulations made under. 
The Authority shall operationalise a web based online system for submitting applications for registration of 
projects within a period of one year from the date of its establishment. 
Granting of Registration by the Authority 
On receipt of the application, the Authority shall within a period of thirty days- 
 
(a) grant registration subject to the provisions of the Act and the rules and regulations made 
thereunder. A registration number, including a Login Id and password to the applicant for accessing 
the website of the Authority and to create his web page and to fill therein the details of the proposed 
project; or 
 
(b) reject the application for reasons to be recorded in writing, if such application does not conform to 
the provisions of this Act or the rules or regulations made thereunder.Application shall not be 
rejected unless the applicant has been given an opportunity of being heard in the matter. 
If the Authority fails to grant the registration or reject the application, as the case may be, the project shall be 
deemed to have been registered, and the Authority shall within a period of seven days of the expiry of the 
said period of thirty days specified. 
The registration granted shall be valid for a period declared by the promoter for completion of the project or 
phase thereof, as the case may be. 
Extension of registration 
Delay in handing over of projects by the developer within the stipulated time frame has been a major woe of 
the buyers and hence has been a major trigger for promulgation of this Act. Hence, at the time of registration, 
a developer has to specify a time line during which he will complete and handover the project to the buyer. 
The timeline is very sacrosanct because if he fails to do so within the stated time, then there are rigorous 
provisions in the Act as prescribed in section 7 & 8 whereby his registration would be revoked and his project 
would be usurped by the Regulator. Though as per section 6, an extension of registration may be granted at 
the sole discretion of the regulator due to Force Majeure conditions or if there are reasonable circumstances 
which merit extension. 
The registration granted may be extended by the Authority on an application made by the promoter due to 
force majeure, in such form and on payment of such fee as may be specified by regulations made by the 
Authority. 
"Force majeure" shall mean a case of war, flood, drought, fire, cyclone, earthquake or any other calamity 
caused by nature affecting the regular development of the real estate project. 
The Authority may in reasonable circumstances, without default on the part of the promoter, based on the 
facts of each case, and for reasons to be recorded in writing, extend the registration granted to a project for 
such time as it considers necessary, which shall, in aggregate, not exceed a period of one year. 
Application for extension of registration shall not be rejected unless the applicant has been given an 
opportunity of being heard in the matter. 
                                                                 Lesson 17        Real Estate (Regulation & Development) Act, 2016 
399 
Revocation of registration 
The Authority may, on receipt of a complaint or suomotu in this behalf or on the recommendation of the 
competent authority, revoke the registration granted, after being satisfied that— 
 
(a) the promoter makes default in doing anything required by or under this Act or the rules or the 
regulations made there under; 
 
(b) the promoter violates any of the terms or conditions of the approval given by the competent 
authority; 
 
(c) the promoter is involved in any kind of unfair practice or irregularities. 
The term "unfair practice means" a practice which, for the purpose of promoting the sale or development of 
any real estate project adopts any unfair method or unfair or deceptive practice including any of the following 
practices, namely:— 
 
A. the practice of making any statement, whether in writing or by visible representation which,— 
 
(i) falsely represents that the services are of a particular standard or grade; 
 
(ii) represents that the promoter has approval or affiliation which such promoter does not have; 
 
(iii) makes a false or misleading representation concerning the services;

or otherwise of services that are not intended to be offered;

the proposed revocation. 
The Authority may, instead of revoking the registration, permit it to remain in force subject to such further 
terms and conditions as it thinks fit to impose in the interest of the allottees, and any such terms and 
conditions so imposed shall be binding upon the promoter. 
The Authority, upon the revocation of the registration-

list of defaulters and display his photograph on its website and also inform the other Real Estate 
Regulatory Authority in other States and Union territories about such revocation or registration;

provided under the provisions of the Act: 
In case of revocation of registration of a project under the Act, the association of allottees shall have the first 
right of refusal for carrying out of the remaining development works. 
Registration of real estate agents 
Real estate broking is one of the easiest business in India as there are no specific qualification or experience 
requirements and also there is no code of practice which sets accountability, transparency and professional 
benchmarks. Hence, there are thousands of non-professional agents/ brokers in every city operating without 
any accountability. Hence, to bring in transparency and accountability, agents have also been covered under 
the ambit of RERA and registration requirement has been mandatory for them as per section 9 of the Act. 
Without obtaining registration, real estate agent shall not facilitate the sale or purchase of or act on behalf of 
any person to facilitate the sale or purchase of any plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, in a real 
estate project or part of it, being the part of the real estate project registered, being sold by the promoter in 
any planning area. 
Every real estate agent shall make an application to the Authority for registration in such form, manner, 
within such time and accompanied by such fee and documents as may be prescribed. 
The Authority shall, within such period, in such manner and upon satisfying itself of the fulfilment of such 
conditions, as may be prescribed— 
 
(a) grant a single registration to the real estate agent for the entire State of Union territory, as the case 
may be; 
 
(b) reject the application for reasons to be recorded in writing, if such application does not conform to 
the provisions of the Act or the rules or regulations made there under: 
Application shall not be rejected unless the applicant has been given an opportunity of being heard in the 
matter. 
Whereon the completion of the period prescribed under the act, if the applicant does not receive any 
communication about the deficiencies in his application or the rejection of his application, he shall be 
deemed to have been registered. 
Every real estate agent who is registered as per the provisions of this Act or the rules and regulations made 
there under, shall be granted a registration number by the Authority, which shall be quoted by the real estate 
agent in every sale facilitated by him under this Act. 
Every registration shall be valid for such period as may be prescribed, and shall be renewable for a period in 
such manner and on payment of such fee as may be prescribed. 
Where any real estate agent who has been granted registration under this Act commits breach of any of the 
conditions thereof or any other terms and conditions specified under this Act or any rules or regulations 
made there under, or where the Authority is satisfied that such registration has been secured by the real 
estate agent through misrepresentation or fraud, the Authority may, without prejudice to any other provisions 
                                                                 Lesson 17        Real Estate (Regulation & Development) Act, 2016 
401 
under this Act, revoke the registration or suspend the same for such period as it thinks fit: 
Provided that no such revocation or suspension shall be made by the Authority unless an opportunity of 
being heard has been given to the real estate agent. 
Functions of real estate agents 
Every real estate agent which is not registered with the Authority shall not facilitate the sale or purchase of 
any plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, in a real estate project or part of it, being sold by the 
promoter in any planning area. So, firstly they require to register themselves with the authority.

prescribed. 
Every real estate agent not to involve himself in any unfair trade practices, namely:— 
 
(i) the practice of making any statement, whether orally or in writing or by visible representation

▪ represents that the promoter or himself has approval or affiliation which such promoter or 
himself does not have; 
 
▪ makes a false or misleading representation concerning the services; 
 
(ii) permitting the publication of any advertisement whether in any newspaper or otherwise of services 
that are not intended to be offered. 
Every real estate agent shall facilitate the possession of all the information and documents, as the allottee, is

other functions as may be prescribed.

THE REAL ESTATE REGULATORY AUTHORITY 
As stated earlier, though this sector has seen unprecedented growth since Independence, it has remained 
unregulated till know. We have witnessed that whenever a regulator is appointed for a sector, like SEBI, 
IRDAI, TRAI etc, it widens the sectors. Accordingly, this act mandates that RERA would be established by 
each of the State and UT for administering the real estate sector in the respective State/UT. A state can have 
more than one RERA or two states can have the same authority. All States and UTs were to appoint RERA 
by 1st May 2017 but few States have missed the deadline but it is expected that they will appoint RERA in 
their respective states by 31st July 2017 as it is the last date by which the ongoing projects have to 
registered by the developer with RERA.

India is witnessing a phenomenal growth and expansion in the corporate sector. The growing demand for 
specialists in almost every sphere of the corporate functions has led to emergence of professionals who can 
perform specialized skills with near perfection in their respective fields. A company secretary is one such 
professional who is responsible for efficient management of the corporate sector. He ensures compliance of 
various company legislations and advises directors on statutory requirements of the company. Apart from 
carrying out these functions, he also looks after finance, accounts, legal, secretarial, personnel and 
administrative functions in private as well as public sectors. 
The Companies Act, 2013 confers a special status to Company Secretary as the key managerial personnel 
and has bracketed him along with Managing Director (MD) or Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or Manager, 
Whole-time director(s) or Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Every listed company and every other public 
company having a paid up share capital of ten crore rupees or more has to appoint a whole time Key 
Managerial Personnel. Whole time Company Secretary is also required to be appointed in other companies 
which have a paid up share capital of five crore rupees or more. 
Almost every kind of organization whose affairs are conducted by boards, councils or other corporate 
structures, be it a company, trust, association, federation, authority, commission or the like find it useful to 
appoint a person who holds the qualification of Company Secretaryship in key administrative position. 
Practising Company Secretaries have been authorized to issue Certificate regarding compliance of 
conditions of Corporate Governance. Practising Company Secretaries have also been recognized to appear 
before various Tribunals such as NCLT, NCLAT, Securities Appellate Tribunal, Competition Commission of 
India, Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal, Consumer Forums, Tax Tribunals etc. Reserve 
Bank of India has also recognized the Practising Company Secretaries to undertake Diligence Report for 
Banks. 
The rapid Change in Indian Legislative has brought about a sea change in the role and profile of a company 
secretary. They are now being seen as corporate development planners. Besides embarking upon traditional 
areas of practice, Company Secretaries in Practice are increasingly required to advise and guide on legal 
aspects of business which intimately concern areas such as registration under RERA, production, drafting of 
various documents, sales, marketing and administration for identifying expansion opportunities, issuing due 
diligence or comfort certificate, arranging foreign collaborations, amalgamations, mergers, acquisition, 
EP-EBCL

takeovers, setting up of subsidiaries and joint ventures within and outside India etc. The new opportunities 
offered by the growing capital markets and financial services have greatly contributed to the development of 
the practice side of the profession.

LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL 
446 
INTRODUCTION 
The Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 was enacted to prohibit benami transactions and the right 
to recover property held benami. The said Act, inter alia, provides that—(a) all the properties held benami 
shall be subject to acquisition by such authority in such manner and after following such procedure as may 
be prescribed; (b) no amount shall be payable for the acquisition of any property held benami; (c) the 
purchase of property by any person in the name of his wife or unmarried daughter for their benefit would not 
be benami transaction; (d) the securities held by a depository as registered owner under the provisions of the 
Depositories Act, 1996 or participant as an agent of a depository would not be benami transactions.  
During the administration of the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988, it was found that the provisions 
of the aforesaid Act are inadequate to deal with benami transactions as the Act does not—(i) contain any 
specific provision for vesting of confiscated property with Central Government; (ii) have any provision for an 
appellate mechanism against an action taken by the authorities under the Act, while barring the jurisdiction of 
a civil court; (iii) confer the powers of the civil court upon the authorities for its implementation; and (iv) 
provide for adequate enabling rule making powers.  
In view of the circumstances stated above, comprehensive amendments to the Benami Transactions 
(Prohibition) Act, 1988 has become necessary in order to prohibit holding property in benami and restrict 
right to recover or transfer property held benami and also to provide a mechanism and procedure for 
confiscation of property held benami. It is, therefore, felt necessary to bring comprehensive amendments to 
the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 to deal with benami transactions.  
With a view to providing effective regime for prohibition of benami transactions, the Benami Transactions 
(Prohibition) Act, 1988 was amended through the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amended Act, 2016. 
The amended law empowers the specified authorities to provisionally attach benami properties which can 
eventually be confiscated. Besides, if a person is found guilty of offence of benami transaction by the 
competent court, he shall be punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than one year but 
which may extend to 7 years and shall also be liable to fine which may extend to 25% of the fair market value 
of the property.  
The legislation is also intended to effectively prohibit benami transactions and consequently prevent 
circumvention of law through unfair practices. It empowers the Government to confiscate benami property by 
following due procedure. It therefore promotes equity across all citizens. However, those who declare their 
benami properties under income declaration scheme will get immunity under the Benami Act.  
The Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016 received the assent of the President on 
the10th August, 2016and came into effect from1st November, 2016. 
The Salient Features of the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 are as under: 
It defines a benami transaction and benami property and also provides for exclusions and 
transactions which shall not be construed benami 
It provides the consequences of entering into a prohibited benami transactions 
It lays down the procedure for determination and related penal consequences in the case of 
a prohibited benami transaction 
It also provides that the powers of civil court shall be available to authorities under the said 
Act 
                                                                       Lesson 18        The Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 447 
Miscellaneous Provisions have been provided for service of notice, protection of action taken 
in good faith, etc. 
Central Government empowers to make rules for the implementation of the provisions of the 
Bill 
It enables the Central Government in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court to 
designate one or more Courts of Session as Special Court or Special Courts for the purpose 
of the Bill 
It provides penalty for entering into benami transactions and for furnishing any false 
documents in any proceeding under the Bill

LESSON ROUND-UP 
• The Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 prohibits benami transactions and consequently prevent 
circumvention of law through unfair practices. It empowers the Government to confiscate benami property 
by following due procedure. It therefore promotes equity across all citizens. However, those who declare 
their benami properties under income declaration scheme will get immunity under the Benami Act.  
• The Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016received the assent of the President on the 
10th August, 2016 and came into effect from1st November, 2016. 
• Where any person enters into any benami transaction on and after the date of commencement of the 
Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016, shall be punishable in accordance with the 
provisions contained in Chapter VII. 
• Any property, which is subject matter of benami transaction, shall be liable to be confiscated by the Central 
Government.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
The globalization process driven by advancements in 
communications and information technology, have 
made the international system more interactive, 
integrated, interrelated, and interconnected. This 
dynamic 
has 
unleashed 
the 
floodgates 
of 
opportunities for criminals to expand, widen and 
deepen their reach, become more sophisticated in 
their operations, and intensify their level and pace of 
transactions.  
Because of the opportunities and needs created by 
the global dimension of business, crimes such as 
fraud, counterfeiting, corruption and embezzlement 
have opportunities to shift from individual or family 
ambit to more organized and competitive global 
structures. 
The problem of money-laundering is no longer 
restricted to the geo political boundaries of any 
country. It is a global menace that cannot be 
contained by any nation alone. In view of this, India 
has become a member of the Financial Action Task 
Force and Asia Pacific Group on money-laundering, 
which are committed to the effective implementation 
and 
enforcement 
of 
internationally 
accepted 
standards 
against 
money-laundering 
and 
the 
financing of terrorism. 
The Prevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002 
addresses the international obligations under the 
Political Declaration and Global Programme of Action 
adopted by the General Assembly of the United 
Nations to prevent money laundering. The Act was 
amended in the year 2005, 2009 and 2012 to remove 
the difficulties arisen in implementation of the Act. 
Therefore, it is essential for the students to be 
familiar with the law relating to Prevention of Money-
laundering Act, 2002. 
  
The Prevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002 enacted to prevent money laundering and to provide for confiscation of 
property derived from, or involved in, money laundering and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL 
458 
INTRODUCTION 
Money laundering is the processing of criminal proceeds to disguise its illegal origin. Terrorism, illegal arms 
sales, financial crimes, smuggling, and the activities of organised crime, including drug trafficking and 
prostitution rings, generate huge sums. Embezzlement, insider trading, bribery and computer fraud also 
produce large profits and create an incentive to legitimise the ill-gotten gains through money laundering. 
When a criminal activity generates substantial profits, the individual or group involved in such activities route 
the funds to safe heavens by disguising the sources, changing the form, or moving the funds to a place 
where they are less likely to attract attention. 
Most fundamentally, money laundering is inextricably linked to the underlying criminal activity that generates 
it. In essence, the laundering enables criminal activity to continue. 
Process of Money Laundering 
The process of money laundering can be classified into three stages, namely, placement, layering and 
integration. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the initial or placement stage of money laundering, the launderer introduces his illegal profits into the 
financial system, by breaking up large amounts of cash into less conspicuous smaller sums that are then 
deposited directly into a bank account, or by purchasing a series of monetary instruments that are later 
collected and deposited into accounts at another location. 
After the funds are entered into the financial system, the layering takes place. In this stage, the launderer 
engages in a series of conversions or movements of the funds to distance them from their source. The funds 
might be channeled through the purchase and sale of investment instruments, or the launderer might simply 
wire the funds through a series of accounts at various banks across the globe. 
After successful processing of criminal profits through the first two phases of the money laundering process, 
the launderer moves them to integration. In this stage the funds re-enter the legitimate economy. The 
launderer might choose to invest the funds into real estate, luxury assets, or business ventures. 
Impact of Money Laundering on Development 
Economies with growing or developing financial centers, but inadequate controls are particularly vulnerable 
to money laundering, as against the established financial center countries, which implement comprehensive 
anti-money laundering regimes. The gaps in a national anti-money laundering system are exploited by 
launderers, who tend to move their networks to countries and financial systems with weak or ineffective 
countermeasures. As with the damaged integrity of an individual financial institution, there is a damping 
effect on foreign direct investment when a country’s commercial and financial sectors are perceived to be 
subject to the control and influence of organised crime.

In times of decelerating growth, an infusion of hard currency can bolster a country’s foreign reserves; ease 
the hardship associated with budget tightening policies and moderate foreign indebtedness. While these are 
short-term benefits associated with an inflow of criminal monies, the long-term effects are mostly negative. 
One difference between official borrowing and laundered funds is that the former can be controlled by 
Government, whereas the funds owned by criminals escape the governments ability to control and regulate 
the economy. 
The possible social, economic and political effects of money laundering, if left unchecked or dealt with 
ineffectively, are serious. Through the process of money laundering, organised crime can infiltrate financial 
institutions, acquire control of large sectors of the economy through investment, or offer bribes to public 
officials and indeed governments. Thus, the economic and political influence of criminal organisations can 
weaken the social fabric, ethical standards and ultimately the democratic institutions of society. 
What is the connection of money laundering with society at large? 
The possible social and political costs of money laundering, if left unchecked or dealt 
with ineffectively, are serious. Organised crime can infiltrate financial institutions, 
acquire control of large sectors of the economy through investment, or offer bribes to 
public officials and indeed governments.  
The economic and political influence of criminal organisations can weaken the social 
fabric, collective ethical standards, and ultimately the democratic institutions of 
society. In countries transitioning to democratic systems, this criminal influence can 
undermine the transition. Most fundamentally, money laundering is inextricably 
linked to the underlying criminal activity that generated it. Laundering enables 
criminal activity to continue. 
 
Prevention of Money Laundering – Global Initiatives 
Since money laundering is an international phenomenon, transnational co-operation is of critical importance 
in the fight against this menace. A number of initiatives have been taken to deal with the problem at 
international level. In this context, the United Nations or the Bank for International Settlements, took some 
initiatives in 1980s to address the problem of money laundering. However, with the creation of the Financial 
Action Task Force (FATF) in 1989, regional groupings, such as the European Union, Council of Europe, and 
organisation of American States also established anti- money laundering standards for their member 
countries. 
The major international agreements addressing money laundering include the United Nations Convention 
against Illicit Trafficking in Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (the Vienna Convention) and Council of 
Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds of Crime. The role of 
financial institutions in preventing and detecting money laundering has also been the subject of 
pronouncements by the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation Supervisory Practices, the European Union 
and the International Organization of Securities Commissions. 
The Vienna Convention 
The first major initiative in the prevention of money laundering was the United Nations Convention against 
Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances in December 1988 (popularly known as Vienna 
Convention). This convention laid the groundwork for efforts to combat money laundering by obliging the 
member states to criminalize the laundering of money from drug trafficking. It promotes international 
cooperation in investigations and makes extradition between member states applicable to money laundering. 
EP-EBCL 
460 
The convention also establishes the principle that domestic bank secrecy provisions should not interfere with 
international criminal investigations. 
Council of Europe Convention 
The Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime, 
1990 establishes a common policy on money laundering. It sets out a common definition of money 
laundering and common measures for dealing with it. The Convention lays down the principles for 
international cooperation among the member states, which may also include states outside the Council of 
Europe. This convention came into force in September 1993. One of the purposes of the convention is to 
facilitate international cooperation as regards investigative assistance, search, seizure and confiscation of 
the proceeds of all types of criminality, particularly serious crimes, such as, drug offences, arms dealing, 
terrorist offences etc. and other offences which generate large profits. 
European Union Money Laundering Directive 
In response to the new opportunities for money laundering opened up by the liberalization of capital 
movements and cross-border financial services in the European Union, the Council of the European 
Communities in June, 1991 issued a directive on the Prevention of Use of the Financial System for the 
Purpose of Money Laundering. The directive requires member states to outlaw money laundering. The 
member states have been put under obligation to require financial institutions to establish and maintain 
internal systems to prevent laundering, to obtain the identification of customers with whom they enter into 
transaction of more than a particular amount and to keep proper records for at least five years. The financial 
institutions are also required to report suspicious transactions and ensure that such reporting does not result 
in liability for the institution or its employees. 
Basle Committee’s Statement of Principles 
In December 1988 the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation Supervisory Practices issued a statement of 
principles to be complied by the international banks of member states. These principles include identifying 
customers, avoiding suspicious transactions, and cooperating with law enforcement agencies. The statement 
aims at encouraging the banking sector to adopt common position in order to ensure that banks are not used 
to hide or launder funds acquired through criminal activities. 
Resolution of the International Organization of Securities Commissions 
The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) adopted, in October 1992, a resolution 
encouraging its members to take necessary steps to combat money laundering in securities and futures 
markets. 
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF)  
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 by the Ministers 
of its Member jurisdictions. The objectives of the FATF are to set standards and promote effective 
implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist 
financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system. The FATF is therefore 
a “policy-making body” which works to generate the necessary political will to bring about national legislative 
and regulatory reforms in these areas. 
The FATF has developed a series of Recommendations that are recognised as the international standard for 
combating of money laundering and the financing of terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction. They form the basis for a co-ordinated response to these threats to the integrity of the financial 
                                                                       Lesson 19        Prevention of Money Laundering

system and help ensure a level playing field. First issued in 1990, the FATF Recommendations were revised 
in 1996, 2001, 2003 and in 2012 to ensure that they remain up to date and relevant, and they are intended to 
be of universal application. 
The FATF monitors the progress of its members in implementing necessary measures, reviews money 
laundering and terrorist financing techniques and counter-measures, and promotes the adoption and 
implementation of appropriate measures globally. In collaboration with other international stakeholders, the 
FATF works to identify national-level vulnerabilities with the aim of protecting the international financial 
system from misuse. 
History of the FATF 
In response to mounting concern over money laundering, the Financial Action Task Force on Money 
Laundering (FATF) was established by the G-7 Summit that was held in Paris in 1989. Recognising the 
threat posed to the banking system and to financial institutions, the G-7 Heads of State or Government and 
President of the European Commission convened the Task Force from the G-7 member States, the 
European Commission and eight other countries. 
FATF Recommendations 
The Task Force was given the responsibility of examining money laundering techniques and trends, 
reviewing the action which had already been taken at a national or international level, and setting out the 
measures that still needed to be taken to combat money laundering. In April 1990, less than one year after 
its creation, the FATF issued a report containing a set of Forty Recommendations, which were intended to 
provide a comprehensive plan of action needed to fight against money laundering.  
In 2001, the development of standards in the fight against terrorist financing was added to the mission of the 
FATF. In October 2001 the FATF issued the Eight Special Recommendations to deal with the issue of 
terrorist financing. The continued evolution of money laundering techniques led the FATF to revise the FATF 
standards comprehensively in June 2003. In October 2004 the FATF published a Ninth Special 
Recommendations, further strengthening the agreed international standards for combating money laundering 
and terrorist financing - the 40+9 Recommendations. 
In February 2012, the FATF completed a thorough review of its standards and published the revised FATF 
Recommendations,. This revision is intended to strengthen global safeguards and further protect the integrity 
of the financial system by providing governments with stronger tools to take action against financial crime. 
They have been expanded to deal with new threats such as the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction, and to be clearer on transparency and tougher on corruption. The 9 Special Recommendations 
on terrorist financing have been fully integrated with the measures against money laundering. This has 
resulted in a stronger and clearer set of standards. 
United Nations Global Programme Against Money Laundering 
Office of the Drug Control and Crime Prevention implement this programme against Money Laundering with 
a view to increase the effectiveness of international action against money laundering through comprehensive 
technical cooperation services offered to Governments. The programme encompasses following three areas 
of activities, providing various means to states and institutions in their efforts to effectively combat money 
laundering: 
 
(i) Technical cooperation is the main task of the Programme. It encompasses activities of creating 
awareness, institution building and training. 
 
EP-EBCL 
462 
 
(ii) The research and analysis aims at offering States Key Information to better understand the 
phenomenon of money laundering and to enable the international community to devise more 
efficient and effective countermeasure strategies. 
 
(iii) The commitment to support the establishment of financial investigation services for raising the 
overall effectiveness of law enforcement measures. 
The implementation of the Global Programme against Money Laundering is carried out in the spirit of 
cooperation with other international, regional and national organizations and institutions. 
 
What influence does money laundering have on economic development? 
Launderers are continuously looking for new routes for laundering their 
funds. Economies with growing or developing financial centres, but 
inadequate controls are particularly vulnerable as established financial 
centre countries implement comprehensive anti-money laundering regimes. 
Differences between national anti-money laundering systems will be 
exploited by launderers, who tend to move their networks to countries and 
financial systems with weak or ineffective countermeasures. 
Some might argue that developing economies cannot afford to be too 
selective about the sources of capital they attract. But postponing action is 
dangerous. The more it is deferred, the more entrenched organised crime 
can become. 
As with the damaged integrity of an individual financial institution, there is a damping effect on foreign direct 
investment when a country’s commercial and financial sectors are perceived to be subject to the control and 
influence of organised crime. Fighting money laundering and terrorist financing is therefore a part of creating 
a business friendly environment which is a precondition for lasting economic development.

(KYC) Norms/ (AML) Measures/ (CFT) Guidelines – Anti Money Laundering Standards 
RBI issued Master Circular on Know Your Customer (KYC) norms/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) 
standards/Combating of Financing of Terrorism (CFT)/Obligation of banks under Prevention of Money 
Laundering Act, (PMLA), 2002 and Banks were advised to follow certain customer identification procedure 
for opening of accounts and monitoring transactions of a suspicious nature for the purpose of reporting it to 
appropriate authority. These ‘Know Your Customer’ guidelines have been revisited in the context of the 
Recommendations made by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Anti Money Laundering (AML) 
standards and on Combating Financing of Terrorism (CFT). Banks have been advised to ensure that a 
proper policy framework on ‘Know Your Customer’ and Anti-Money Laundering measures with the approval 
of the Board is formulated and put in place. 
The objective of KYC Norms/ AML Measures/ CFT Guidelines  
The objective of Know Your Customer (KYC) Norms/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Measures/Combating of 
Financing of Terrorism (CFT) guidelines is to prevent banks from being used, intentionally or unintentionally, 
by criminal elements for money laundering or terrorist financing activities. KYC procedures also enable 
banks to know/understand their customers and their financial dealings better which in turn help them manage 
their risks prudently. 
Obligation of Banks 
• Banks should keep in mind that the information collected from the customer for the purpose of opening 
of account is to be treated as confidential and details thereof are not to be divulged for cross selling or 
any other like purposes. Banks should, therefore, ensure that information sought from the customer is 
relevant to the perceived risk, is not intrusive, and is in conformity with the guidelines issued in this 
regard. Any other information from the customer should be sought separately with his/her consent and 
after opening the account. 
• Banks should ensure that any remittance of funds by way of demand draft, mail/telegraphic transfer or 
any other mode and issue of travellers’cheques for value of Rupees fifty thousand and above is 
effected by debit to the customer’s account or against cheques and not against cash payment.  
• Banks should ensure that the provisions of Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 1976 as amended 
from time to time, wherever applicable are strictly adhered to. 
KYC Policy 
Banks should frame their KYC policies incorporating the following four key elements: 
 
 
 
 
 
EP-EBCL 
470 
For the purpose of KYC policy, a ‘Customer’ is defined as: 
• a person or entity that maintains an account and/or has a business relationship with the bank; 
• one on whose behalf the account is maintained (i.e. the beneficial owner); 
• beneficiaries of transactions conducted by professional intermediaries, such as Stock Brokers, 
Chartered Accountants, Solicitors etc. as permitted under the law, and 
• any person or entity connected with a financial transaction which can pose significant reputational or 
other risks to the bank, say, a wire transfer or issue of a high value demand draft as a single 
transaction. 
Introduction of New Technologies – Credit cards/debit cards/ smart cards/gift cards 
Banks should pay special attention to any money laundering threats that may arise from new or developing 
technologies including internet banking that might favour anonymity, and take measures, if needed, to 
prevent their use in money laundering schemes. Many banks are engaged in the business of issuing a 
variety of Electronic Cards that are used by customers for buying goods and services, drawing cash from 
ATMs, and can be used for electronic transfer of funds. Banks are required to ensure full compliance with all 
KYC/AML/CFT guidelines issued from time to time, in respect of add-on/ supplementary cardholders also. 
Further, marketing of credit cards is generally done through the services of agents. Banks should ensure that 
appropriate KYC procedures are duly applied before issuing the cards to the customers. It is also desirable 
that agents are also subjected to KYC measures. 
Information to be preserved 
Banks are required to maintain all necessary information in respect of transactions to permit reconstruction of 
individual transaction, including the following information: 
 
(a) the nature of the transactions; 
 
(b) the amount of the transaction and the currency in which it was denominated; 
 
(c) the date on which the transaction was conducted; and 
 
(d) the parties to the transaction 
Maintenance and Preservation of record 
 
(a) Banks are required to maintain the records containing information of all transactions. Banks should 
take appropriate steps to evolve a system for proper maintenance and preservation of account 
information in a manner that allows data to be retrieved easily and quickly whenever required or 
when requested by the competent authorities.  
 
(b) Banks should ensure that records pertaining to the identification of the customer and his address 
(e.g. copies of documents like passports, identity cards, driving licenses, PAN card, utility bills etc.) 
obtained while opening the account and during the course of business relationship, are properly 
preserved. The identification records and transaction data should be made available to the 
competent authorities upon request. 
 
(c) Banks have been advised to pay special attention to all complex, unusual large transactions and all 
unusual patterns of transactions, which have no apparent economic or visible lawful purpose. It is 
further clarified that the background including all documents/office records/memorandums 
pertaining to such transactions and purpose thereof should, as far as possible, be examined and the 
                                                                       Lesson 19        Prevention of Money Laundering 
471 
findings at branch as well as Principal Officer level should be properly recorded. Such records and 
related documents should be made available to help auditors in their day-to-day work relating to 
scrutiny of transactions and also to Reserve Bank/other relevant authorities.  
Reporting to Financial Intelligence Unit – India 
In terms of the PMLA Rules, banks are required to report information relating to cash and suspicious 
transactions and all transactions involving receipts by non-profit organisations of value more than rupees ten 
lakh or its equivalent in foreign currency to the Director, Financial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND) in respect 
of transactions.

LESSON ROUND-UP 
• 
Money laundering is the processing of criminal proceeds to disguise its illegal origin. 
• 
The process of money laundering can be classified into three stages, namely, placement, layering and integration. 
• 
The Prevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002 was enacted to prevent money laundering and to provide for 
confiscation of property derived from, or involved in, money laundering and for matters connected therewith or 
incidental thereto.  
• 
The Act also addresses the international obligations under the Political Declaration and Global Programme of Action 
adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations to prevent money laundering. 
• 
The Act contains provisions pertaining to offences and punishment for money laundering, attachment, adjudication 
and confiscation, obligations of banking companies, financial institutions and intermediaries, Summons, Searches 
and Seizures etc.  
• 
The Act states that whoever, acquires, owns, possesses, or transfers any proceeds of crime or knowingly enters into 
any transaction which is related to proceeds of crime directly or indirectly or conceals or aids in the concealment of 
the proceeds of crime, shall be guilty of offence of money laundering. 
• 
Every banking company, financial institution and intermediary is required to maintain a record of all transactions, the 
nature and value of which may be prescribed, whether such transactions comprise of a single transaction or a series 
of transactions legally connected to each other, and when such series of transactions take place within a month. 
• 
The objective of Know Your Customer (KYC) Norms/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Measures/Combating of 
Financing of Terrorism (CFT) guidelines is to prevent banks from being used, intentionally or unintentionally, by 
criminal elements for money laundering or terrorist financing activities. KYC procedures also enable banks to 
know/understand their customers and their financial dealings better which in turn help them manage their risks 
prudently.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
A contract is an agreement enforceable at law, 
made between two or more persons, by which 
rights are acquired by one or more to acts or 
forbearances on the part of the other or others. A 
contract is an agreement creating and defining 
obligations between the parties. 
The Indian Contract Act, 1872 regulates all the 
transactions of a company. It lays down the general 
principles 
relating 
to 
the 
formation 
and 
enforceability of contracts; rules governing the 
provisions of an agreement and offer; the various 
types of contracts including those of indemnity and 
guarantee, bailment and pledge and agency. It also 
contains provisions pertaining to breach of a 
contract.  
The Law of Contract constitutes the most important 
branch of Mercantile or Commercial Law. It affects 
everybody, more so, trade, commerce and industry. 
It may be said that the contract is the foundation of 
the civilized world. Therefore, it is essential for the 
students to be familiar with the law relating to 
Contract.

LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL 
474 
Meaning and Nature of Contract 
The law relating to contract is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872. The Act came into force on the first 
day of September, 1872. The preamble to the Act says that it is an Act “to define and amend certain parts of 
the law relating to contract”. It extends to the whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir. The Act 
is by no means exhaustive on the law of contract. It does not deal with all the branches of the law of contract. 
Thus, contracts relating to partnership, sale of goods, negotiable instruments, insurance etc. are dealt with 
by separate Acts. 
The Indian Contract Act mostly deals with the general principles and rules governing contracts. The Act is divisible 
into two parts. The first part (Section 1-75) deals with the general principles of the law of contract, and therefore 
applies to all contracts irrespective of their nature. The second part (Sections 124-238) deals with certain special 
kinds of contracts, namely contracts of Indemnity and Guarantee, Bailment, Pledge, and Agency. 
The Indian Contract Act has defined contract in Section 2(h) as “an agreement enforceable by law”. 
These definitions indicate that a contract essentially consists of two distinct parts. First, there must be an 
agreement. Secondly, such an agreement must be enforceable by law. To be enforceable, an agreement 
must be coupled with an obligation. 
A contract therefore, is a combination of the two elements: (1) an agreement and (2) an obligation. 
Agreement 
An agreement gives birth to a contract. As per Section 2(e) of the Indian Contract Act “every promise and 
every set of promises, forming the consideration for each other, is an agreement. It is evident from the 
definition given above that an agreement is based on a promise. What is a promise? According to Section 
2(b) of the Indian Contract Act “when the person to whom the proposal is made signifies his assent thereto, 
the proposal is said to be accepted. A proposal, when accepted, becomes a promise. An agreement, 
therefore, comes into existence when one party makes a proposal or offer to the other party and that other 
party signifies his assent thereto. In nutshell, an agreement is the sum total of offer and acceptance.” 
An analysis of the definition given above reveals the following characteristics of an agreement: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
475 
Obligation 
An obligation is the legal duty to do or abstain from doing what one has promised to do or abstain from 
doing. A contractual obligation arises from a bargain between the parties to the agreement who are called 
the promisor and the promisee. Section 2(b) says that when the person to whom the proposal is made 
signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted; and a proposal when accepted becomes a 
promise. In broad sense, therefore, a contract is an exchange of promises by two or more persons, resulting 
in an obligation to do or abstain from doing a particular act, where such obligation is recognised and 
enforced by law. 
Rights and Obligations 
Where parties have made a binding contract, they have created rights and obligations between themselves. 
The contractual rights and obligations are correlative, e.g., A agrees with B to sell his car for Rs. 10,000 to 
him. In this example, the following rights and obligations have been created: 
 
(i) A is under an obligation to deliver the car to B. 
 
 B has a corresponding right to receive the car. 
 
(ii) B is under an obligation to pay `10,00,000 to A. 
 
 A has a correlative right to receive `10,00,000. 
Agreements which are not Contracts 
Agreements in which the idea of bargain is absent and there is no intention to create legal relations are not 
contracts. These are: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a) Agreements relating to social matters: An agreement between two persons to go together to the 
cinema, or for a walk, does not create a legal obligation on their part to abide by it. Similarly, if I 
promise to take you for a dinner and break that promise, I do not expect to be liable to legal 
penalties. There cannot be any offer and acceptance to hospitality. 
 
(b) Domestic arrangements between husband and wife: In Balfour v. Balfour (1919) 2 KB 571, a 
husband working in Ceylone, had agreed in writing to pay a housekeeping allowance to his wife 
living in England. On receiving information that she was unfaithful to him, he stopped the allowance. 
Held, he was entitled to do so. This was a mere domestic arrangement with no intention to create 
legally binding relations. Therefore, there was no contract. 
Three consequences follow from the above discussion: 
Agreement relating to social matters 
Domestic arrangements between husband 
and wife 
EP-EBCL 
476 
 
(i) To constitute a contract, the parties must intend to create legal relationship. 
 
(ii) The law of contract is the law of those agreements which create obligations, and those obligations 
which have their source in agreement. 
 
(iii) Agreement is the genus of which contract is the specie and, therefore, all contracts are agreements 
but all agreements are not contracts. 
ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF A VALID CONTRACT 
Section 10 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 provides that “all agreements are contracts if they are made by 
the free consent of parties competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object, and are 
not hereby expressly declared to be void”. 
The essential elements of a valid contract are: 
 
(i) An offer or proposal by one party and acceptance of that offer by another party resulting in an 
agreement—consensus-ad-idem. 
 
(ii) An intention to create legal relations or an intent to have legal consequences. 
 
(iii)  The agreement is supported by a lawful consideration. 
 
(iv) The parties to the contract are legally capable of contracting. 
 
(v) Genuine consent between the parties. 
 
(vi) The object and consideration of the contract is legal and is not opposed to public policy. 
 (vii) The terms of the contract are certain. 
 (viii) The agreement is capable of being performed i.e., it is not impossible of being performed. 
Therefore, to form a valid contract there must be (1) an agreement, (2) based on the genuine consent of the 
parties, (3) supported by a lawful consideration, (4) made for a lawful object, and (iv) between the competent 
parties. 
(a) Offer or Proposal and Acceptance 
One of the early steps in the formation of a contract lies in arriving at an agreement between the contracting 
parties by means of an offer and acceptance. Thus, when one party (the offeror) makes a definite proposal to 
another party (the offeree) and the offeree accepts it in its entirety and without any qualification, there is a 
meeting of the minds of the parties and a contract comes into being, assuming that all other elements are 
also present. 
What is an Offer or a Proposal? 
A proposal is also termed as an offer. The word ‘proposal’ is synonymous with the English word “offer”. An 
offer is a proposal by one person, whereby he expresses his willingness to enter into a contractual obligation 
in return for a promise, act or forbearance. Section 2(a) of the Indian Contract Act defines proposal or offer 
as “when one person signifies to another his willingness to do or abstain from doing anything with a view to 
obtaining the assent of that other to such act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal”. The person 
making the proposal or offer is called the proposer or offeror and the person to whom the proposal is made is 
called the offeree. 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
477 
Rules Governing Offers 
A valid offer must comply with the following rules: 
 
(a) An offer must be clear, definite, complete and final. It must not be vague. For example, a promise to 
pay an increased price for a horse if it proves lucky to promisor, is too vague and is not binding. 
 
(b) An offer must be communicated to the offeree. An offer becomes effective only when it has been 
communicated to the offeree so as to give him an opportunity to accept or reject the same. 
 
(c) The communication of an offer may be made by express words-oral or written-or it may be implied 
by conduct. A offers his car to B for `10,000. It is an express offer. A bus plying on a definite route 
goes along the street. This is an implied offer on the part of the owners of the bus to carry 
passengers at the scheduled fares for the various stages. 
 
(d) The communication of the offer may be general or specific. Where an offer is made to a specific 
person it is called specific offer and it can be accepted only by that person. But when an offer is 
addressed to an uncertain body of individuals i.e. the world at large, it is a general offer and can be 
accepted by any member of the general public by fulfilling the condition laid down in the offer. The 
leading case on the subject is Carlillv. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. The company offered by 
advertisement, a reward of `100 to anyone who contacted influenza after using their smoke ball in 
the specified manner. Mrs. Carlill did use smoke ball in the specified manner, but was attacked by 
influenza. She claimed the reward and it was held that she could recover the reward as general 
offer can be accepted by anybody. Since this offer is of a continuing nature, more than one person 
can accept it and can even claim the reward. But if the offer of reward is for seeking some 
information or seeking the restoration of missing thing, then the offer can be accepted by one 
individual who does it first of all. The condition is that the claimant must have prior knowledge of the 
reward before doing that act or providing that information. 
Example: A advertises in the newspapers that he will pay rupees one thousand to anyone who brings to him 
his lost son. B without knowing of this reward finds A’s lost son and restore him to A. In this case since B did 
not know of the reward, he cannot claim it from A even though he finds A’s lost son and brings him to A. 
In India also, in the case of HarbhajanLal  v. HarcharanLal (AIR 1925 All. 539), the same rule was applied. In 
this case, a young boy ran away from his fathers home. The father issued a pamphlet offering a reward of 
`500 to anybody who would bring the boy home. The plaintiff saw the boy at a railway station and sent a 
telegram to the boys father. It was held that the handbill was an offer open to the world at large and was 
capable to acceptance by any person who fulfilled the conditions contained in the offer. The plaintiff 
substantially performed the conditions and was entitled to the reward offered. 
An Offer must be Distinguished from 
(a) An invitation to treat or an invitation to make an offer: e.g., an auctioneers request for bids (which are 
offered by the bidders), the display of goods in a shop window with prices marked upon them, or the display 
of priced goods in a self- service store or a shopkeepers catalogue of prices are invitations to an offer. 
(b) A mere statement of intention: e.g., an announcement of a coming auction sale. Thus, a person who 
attended the advertised place of auction could not sue for breach of contract if the auction was cancelled 
(Harris v. Nickerson (1873) L.R. 8 QB 286). 
(c) A mere communication of information in the course of negotiation: e.g., a statement of the price at which 
one is prepared to consider negotiating the sale of piece of land (Harvey v. Facey (1893) A.C. 552). 
EP-EBCL 
478 
An offer that has been communicated properly continues as such until it lapses, or until it is revoked by the 
offeror, or rejected or accepted by the offeree. 
Lapse of Offer 
Section 6 deals with various modes of lapse of an offer. It states that an offer lapses if— 
 
(a) it is not accepted within the specified time (if any) or after a reasonable time, if none is specified. 
 
(b) it is not accepted in the mode prescribed or if no mode is prescribed in some usual and reasonable 
manner, e.g., by sending a letter by mail when early reply was requested; 
 
(c) the offeree rejects it by distinct refusal to accept it; 
 
(d) either the offeror or the offeree dies before acceptance; 
 
(e) the acceptor fails to fulfill a condition precedent to an acceptance. 
 
(f) the offeree makes a counter offer, it amounts to rejection of the offer and an offer by the offeree 
may be accepted or rejected by the offeror. 
Revocation of Offer by the Offeror 
An offer may be revoked by the offeror at any time before acceptance. 
Like any offer, revocation must be communicated to the offeree, as it does not take effect until it is actually 
communicated to the offeree. Before its actual communication, the offeree, may accept the offer and create a 
binding contract. The revocation must reach the offeree before he sends out the acceptance. 
An offer to keep open for a specified time (option) is not binding unless it is supported by consideration. 
Acceptance 
A contract emerges from the acceptance of an offer. Acceptance is the act of assenting by the offeree to an 
offer. Under Section 2(b) of the Contract Act when a person to whom the proposal is made signifies his 
assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted. A proposal, when accepted becomes a promise.. 
Rules Governing Acceptance 
 
(a) Acceptance may be express i.e. by words spoken or written or implied from the conduct of the 
parties. 
 
(b) If a particular method of acceptance is prescribed, the offer must be accepted in the prescribed 
manner. 
 
(c) Acceptance must be unqualified and absolute and must correspond with all the terms of the offer. 
 
(d) A counter offer or conditional acceptance operates as a rejection of the offer and causes it to lapse, 
e.g., where a horse is offered for Rs. 1,000 and the offeree counter-offers Rs. 990, the offer lapses 
by rejection. 
 
(e) Acceptance must be communicated to the offeror, for acceptance is complete the moment it is 
communicated. Where the offeree merely intended to accept but does not communicate his 
intention to the offeror, there is no contract. Mere mental acceptance is not enough. 
 
(f) Mere silence on the part of the offeree does not amount to acceptance. 
 
 Ordinarily, the offeror cannot frame his offer in such a way as to make the silence or inaction of the 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
479 
offeree as an acceptance. In other words, the offeror can prescribe the mode of acceptance but not 
the mode of rejection. 
 
(g) If the offer is one which is to be accepted by being acted upon, no communication of acceptance to 
the offeror is necessary, unless communication is stipulated for in the offer itself. 
 
 Thus, if a reward is offered for finding a lost dog, the offer is accepted by finding the dog after 
reading about the offer, and it is unnecessary before beginning to search for the dog to give notice 
of acceptance to the offeror. 
 
(h) Acceptance must be given within a reasonable time and before the offer lapses or is revoked. An 
offer becomes irrevocable by acceptance. 
 
 An acceptance never precedes an offer. There can be no acceptance of an offer which is not 
communicated. Similarly, performance of conditions of an offer without the knowledge of the specific 
offer, is no acceptance. Thus in Lalman Shukla v.GauriDutt(1913), where a servant brought the boy 
without knowing of the reward, he was held not entitled to reward because he did not know about 
the offer. 
Standing Offers 
Where a person offers to another to supply specific goods, up to a stated quantity or in any quantity which 
may be required, at a certain rate, during a fixed period, he makes a standing offer. Thus, a tender to supply 
goods as and when required, amounts to a standing offer. 
A standing offer or a tender is of the nature of a continuing offer. An acceptance of such an offer merely 
amounts to intimation that the offer will be considered to remain open during the period specified and that it 
will be accepted from time to time by placing order for specified quantities. Each successive order given, 
while the offer remains in force, is an acceptance of the standing offer as to the quantity ordered, and creates 
a separate contract. It does not bind either party unless and until such orders are given. 
Where P tendered to supply goods to L upto a certain amount and over a certain period, L’s order did not 
come up to the amount expected and P sued for breach of contract Held: Each order made was a separate 
contract and P was bound to fulfill orders made, but there was no obligation on L to make any order to all 
(Percival Ltd. v. L.C.C. (1918). 
Tickets 
Tickets purchased for entrance into places of amusement, or tickets issued by railways or bus companies, 
clock-room tickets, and many other contracts set out in printed documents contain numerous terms, of many 
of which the party receiving the ticket or document is ignorant. If a passenger on a railway train receives a 
ticket on the face of which is printed “this ticket is issued subject to the notices, regulations and conditions 
contained in the current time-tables of the railway”, the regulations and conditions referred to are deemed to 
be communicated to him and he is bound by them whether or not he has read them. He is bound even if he 
is illiterate and unable to read them. But it is important that the notice of the conditions is contemporaneous 
with the making of the contract and not after the contract has been made. 
Contracts by Post 
Contracts by post are subject to the same rules as others, but because of their importance, these are stated 
below separately: 
 
(a) An offer by post may be accepted by post, unless the offeror indicates anything to the contrary. 
EP-EBCL 
480 
 
(b) An offer is made only when it actually reaches the offeree and not before, i.e., when the letter 
containing the offer is delivered to the offeree. 
 
(c) An acceptance is made as far as the offeror is concerned, as soon as the letter containing the 
acceptance is posted, to offerors correct address; it binds the offeror, but not the acceptor. 
 
 An acceptance binds the acceptor only when the letter containing the acceptance reaches the 
offeror. The result is that the acceptor can revoke his acceptance before it reaches the offeror. 
 
(d) An offer may be revoked before the letter containing the acceptance is posted. An acceptance can 
be revoked before it reaches the offeror. 
Contracts over the Telephone 
Contracts over the telephone are regarded the same in principle as those negotiated by the parties in the 
actual presence of each other. In both cases an oral offer is made and an oral acceptance is expected. It is 
important that the acceptance must be audible, heard and understood by the offeror. If during the 
conversation the telephone lines go “dead” and the offeror does not hear the offerees word of acceptance, 
there is no contract at the moment. If the whole conversation is repeated and the offeror hears and 
understands the words of acceptance, the contract is complete (Kanhaiyalal v. Dineshwarchandra (1959) 
AIR, M.P. 234). 
(b) Intention to Create Legal Relations 
The second essential element of a valid contract is that there must be an intention among the parties that the 
agreement should be attached by legal consequences and create legal obligations. If there is no such 
intention on the part of the parties, there is no contract between them. Agreements of a social or domestic 
nature do not contemplate legal relationship. As such they are not contracts. 
A proposal or an offer is made with a view to obtain the assent to the other party and when that other party 
expresses his willingness to the act or abstinence proposed, he accepts the offer and a contract is made 
between the two. But both offer and acceptance must be made with the intention of creating legal relations 
between the parties. The test of intention is objective. The Courts seek to give effect to the presumed 
intention of the parties. Where necessary, the Court would look into the conduct of the parties, for much can 
be inferred from the conduct. The Court is not concerned with the mental intention of the parties, but rather 
with what a reasonable man would say, was the intention of the parties, having regard to all the 
circumstances of the case. 
For example, if two persons agree to assist each other by rendering advice, in the pursuit of virtue, science 
or art, it cannot be regarded as a contract. In commercial and business agreements, the presumption is 
usually that the parties intended to create legal relations. But this presumption is rebuttable which means that 
it must be shown that the parties did not intend to be legally bound. 
(c) Consideration 
 
Need for Consideration 
Consideration is one of the essential elements of a valid contract. The requirement of consideration stems 
from the policy of extending the arm of the law to the enforcement of mutual promises of parties. A mere 
promise is not enforceable at law. For example, if A promises to make a gift of `500 to B, and subsequently 
changes his mind, B cannot succeed against A for breach of promise, as B has not given anything in return. 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
481 
It is only when a promise is made for something in return from the promisee, that such promise can be 
enforced by law against the promisor. This something in return is the consideration for the promise. 
Definition of Consideration 
Sir Fredrick Pollock has defined consideration “as an act or forbearance of one party, or the promise thereof 
is the price for which the promise of the other is bought”. 
It is “some right, interest, profit, or benefit accruing to one party or some forbearance, detriment, loss or 
responsibility, given, suffered or undertaken by the other” (Currie v. Misa (1875) L.R. 10 Ex. 153). 
Section 2(d) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 defines consideration thus: “when at the desire of the promisor, 
the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains from doing, or 
promises to do or to abstain from doing something, such act or abstinence or promise is called a 
consideration for the promise”. 
The fundamental principle that consideration is essential in every contract, is laid down by both the 
definitions but there are some important points of difference in respect of the nature and extent of 
consideration and parties to it under the two systems: 
 
(a) Consideration at the desire of the promisor: Section 2(d) of the Act begins with the statement that 
consideration must move at the desire or request of the promisor. This means that whatever is done 
must have been done at the desire of the promisor and not voluntarily or not at the desire of a third 
party. If A rushes to B’s help whose house is on fire, there is no consideration but a voluntary act. 
But if A goes to B’s help at B’s request, there is good consideration as B did not wish to do the act 
gratuitously. 
 
(b) Consideration may move from the promisee or any other person: In English law, consideration must 
move from the promisee, so that a stranger to the consideration cannot sue on the contract. A 
person seeking to enforce a simple contract must prove in court that he himself has given the 
consideration in return for the promise he is seeking to enforce. 
In Indian law, however, consideration may move from the promisee or any other person, so that a stranger to 
the consideration may maintain a suit. In Chinnaya v. Ramaya, (1882) 4 Mad. 137, a lady by a deed of gift 
made over certain property to her daughter directing her to pay an annuity to the donors brother as had been 
done by the donor herself before she gifted the property. On the same day, her daughter executed in writing 
in favour of the donors brother agreeing to pay the annuity. Afterwards the donee (the daughter) declined to 
fulfil her promise to pay her uncle saying that no consideration had moved from him. The Court, however, 
held that the uncle could sue even though no part of the consideration received by his niece moved from 
him. The consideration from her mother was sufficient consideration. 
Privity of Contract 
A stranger to a contract cannot sue both under the English and Indian law for want of privity of contract. The 
following illustration explains this point. 
In Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. v. Selfridge Ltd. (1915) A.C. 847, D supplied tyres to a wholesaler X, on 
condition that any retailer to whom X re-supplied the tyres should promise X, not to sell them to the public 
below Ds list price. X supplied tyres to S upon this condition, but nevertheless S sold the tyres below the list 
price. Held: There was a contract between D and X and a contract between X and S. Therefore, D could not 
obtain damages from S, as D had not given any consideration for Ss promise to X nor was he party to the 
contract between D and X. 
EP-EBCL 
482 
Thus, a person who is not a party to a contract cannot sue upon it even though the contract is for his benefit. 
A, who is indebted to B, sells his property to C, and C the purchaser of the property, promises to pay off the 
debt to B. In case C fails to pay B, B has no right to sue C for there is no privity of contract between B and C. 
The leading English case on the point is Tweddle v. Atkinson (1861) 1B and Section 393. In this case, the 
father of a boy and the father of a girl who was to be married to the boy, agreed that each of them shall pay a 
sum of money to the boy who was to take up the new responsibilities of married life. After the demise of both 
the contracting parties, the boy (the husband) sued the executors of his father-in-law upon the agreement 
between his father-in-law and his father. Held: the suit was not maintainable as the boy was not a party to 
the contract. 
Exception to the doctrine of privity of contract: Both the Indian law and the English law recognize certain 
exceptions to the rule that a stranger to a contract cannot sue on the contract. In the following cases, a 
person who is not a party to a contract can enforce the contract: 
 
(i) A beneficiary under an agreement to create a trust can sue upon the agreement, though not a party 
to it, for the enforcement of the trust so as to get the trust executed for his benefit. In Khawaja 
Muhammad v. Hussaini Begum, (1910) 32 All. 410, it was held that where a Mohammedan lady 
sued her father-in- law to recover arrears of allowance payable to her by him under an agreement 
between him and her own father in consideration of her marriage, she could enforce the promise in 
her favour in so far as she was a beneficiary under the agreement to make a settlement in her 
favour, and she was claiming as beneficiary under such settlement. 
 
(ii) An assignee under an assignment made by the parties, or by the operation of law (e.g. in case of 
death or insolvency), can sue upon the contract for the enforcement of his rights, tittle and interest. 
But a mere nominee (i.e., the person for whose benefit another has insured his own life) cannot sue 
on the policy because the nominee is not an assignee. 
 
(iii) In cases of family arrangements or settlements between male members of a Hindu family which 
provide for the maintenance or expenses for marriages of female members, the latter though not 
parties to the contract, possess an actual beneficial right which place them in the position of 
beneficiaries under the contract, and can therefore, sue. 
 
(iv) In case of acknowledgement of liability, e.g., where A receives money from B for paying to C, and 
admits to C the receipt of that amount, then A constitutes himself as the agent of C. 
 
(v) Whenever the promisor is by his own conduct estopped from denying his liability to perform the 
promise, the person who is not a party to the contract can sue upon it to make the promisor liable. 
 
(vi) In cases where a person makes a promise to an individual for the benefit of third party and creates 
a charge on certain immovable property for the purpose, the third party can enforce the promise 
though, he is stranger to the contract. 
Kinds of Consideration 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Kind of Consideration 
Executory or future 
Executed or  present 
Past which means a 
past act or forbearance 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
483 
 
Consideration may be: 
 
(a) Executory or future which means that it makes the form of promise to be performed in the future, 
e.g., an engagement to marry someone; or 
 
(b) Executed or present in which it is an act or forbearance made or suffered for a promise. In other 
words, the act constituting consideration is wholly or completely performed, e.g., if A pays today Rs. 
100 to a shopkeeper for goods which are promised to be supplied the next day, A has executed his 
consideration but the shopkeeper is giving executory consideration—a promise to be executed the 
following day. If the price is paid by the buyer and the goods are delivered by the seller at the same 
time, consideration is executed by both the parties. 
 
(c) Past which means a past act or forbearance, that is to say, an act constituting consideration which 
took place and is complete (wholly executed) before the promise is made. 
According to English law, a consideration may be executory or executed but never past. The English law is 
that past consideration is no consideration. The Indian law recognizes all the above three kinds of 
consideration. 
Rules Governing Consideration 
 
(a) Every simple contact must be supported by valuable consideration otherwise it is formally void 
subject to some exceptions. 
 
(b) Consideration may be an act of abstinence or promise. 
 
(c) There must be mutuality i.e., each party must do or agree to do something. A gratuitous promise as 
in the case of subscription for charity, is not enforceable. For example, where A promises to 
subscribe `5,000 for the repair of a temple, and then refuses to pay, no action can be taken against 
him. 
 
(d) Consideration must be real, and not vague, indefinite, or illusory, e.g., a son’s promise to “stop 
being a nuisance” to his father, being vague, is no consideration. 
 
(e) Although consideration must have some value, it need not be adequate i.e., a full return for the 
promise. Section 25 (Exp. II) clearly provides that “an agreement to which the consent of the 
promisor is freely given is not void merely because the consideration is inadequate”. It is upon the 
parties to fix their own prices. For example, where A voluntarily agreed to sell his motor car for `500 
to B, it became a valid contract despite the inadequancy of the consideration. 
 
(f) Consideration must be lawful, e.g., it must not be some illegal act such as paying someone to 
commit a crime. If the consideration is unlawful, the agreement is void. 
 
(g) Consideration must be something more than the promisee is already bound to do for the promisor. 
Thus, an agreement to perform an existing obligation made with the person to whom the obligation 
is already owed, is not made for consideration. For example, if a seaman deserts his ship so 
breaking his contract of service and is induced to return to his duty by the promise for extra wages, 
he cannot later sue for the extra wages since he has only done what he had already contracted for: 
Stilk  v. Myrick (1809). 
When Consideration not Necessary 
The general rule is that an agreement made without consideration is void. But Section 25 of the Indian 
EP-EBCL 
484 
Contract Act lays down certain exceptions which make a promise without consideration valid and binding. 
Thus, an agreement without consideration is valid: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The requirements in the above exceptions are noteworthy. The first one requires written and registered 
promise. The second may be oral or in writing and the third must be in writing. 
Illustrations 
A, for natural love and affection, promises to give his son B `10,000. A put his promise to B into writing and 
registered it. This is a contract. 
A registered agreement between a husband and his wife to pay his earnings to her is a valid contract, as it is 
in writing, is registered, is between parties standing in near relation, and is for love and affection (Poonoo 
Bibi v. FyazBuksh, (1874) 15 Bom L.R. 57). 
But where a husband by a registered document, after referring to quarrels and disagreement between 
himself and his wife, promised to pay his wife a sum of money for her maintenance and separate residence, 
it was held that the promise was unenforceable, as it was not made for love and affection (Rajluckhy Deb 
v.Bhootnath(1900) 4 C.W.N. 488). 
Whether Gratuitous Promise can be Enforced 
A gratuitous promise to subscribe to a charitable cause cannot be enforced, but if the promisee is put to 
some detriment as a result of his acting on the faith of the promise and the promisor knew the purpose and 
also knew that on the faith of the subscription an obligation might be incurred, the promisor would be bound 
by promise (KedarNath v. Gorie Mohan 64). 
It may be noted that it is not necessary that the promisor should benefit by the consideration, it is sufficient if 
the promisee does some act from which a third person is benefited and he would not have done that act but 
for the promise of the promisor. 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
485 
For example, Y requests X for loan, who agrees to give loan to Y if S gives guarantee of repayment of the 
loan. S gives such a guarantee of repayment by Y. Thereupon X gives loan to Y. Here S will be promisor and 
X the promisee, but from X’s action, benefit is derived by Y and not by S. X would not have given the loan to 
Y had S not given the guarantee of repayment of loan. Thus, the benefit conferred on Y by X at the request 
of S is a sufficient consideration on the part of X as against the promise of S to repay the loan. Alternatively, 
it may be said that the detriment which X suffered by giving loan to Y at the request of S is sufficient 
consideration on the part of X in respect of the promise of S to repay the loan. 
Consideration therefore, is some detriment to the promisee or some benefit to the promisor. Detriment to one 
person and benefit to the other are the same things looked from two angles. Ordinarily a promisor is not 
bound by his promise, unless some consideration is offered by the promisee. 
Terms Must be Certain 
It follows from what has been explained in relation to offer, acceptance and consideration that to be binding, 
an agreement must result in a contract. That is to say, the parties must agree on the terms of their contract. 
They must make their intentions clear in their contract. The Court will not enforce a contract the terms of 
which are uncertain. Thus, an agreement to agree in the future (a contract to make a contract) will not 
constitute a binding contract e.g., a promise to pay an actress a salary to be “mutually agreed between us” is 
not a contract since the salary is not yet agreed: Loftus v. Roberts (1902). 
Similarly, where the terms of a final agreement are too vague, the contract will fail for uncertainty. Hence, the 
terms must be definite or capable of being made definite without further agreement of the parties. 
The legal maxim, therefore, is “a contract to contract is not a contract”. If you agree “subject to contract” or 
“subject to agreement”, the contract does not come into existence, for there is no definite or unqualified 
acceptance. 
Resume 
Thus, a contract is always based upon: 
 
(i) Agreement (consensus ad idem) an unqualified acceptance of a definite offer; 
 
(ii) An intent to create legal obligations; and 
 
(iii) Consideration. 
FLAWS IN CONTRACT 
There may be the circumstances under which a contract made under these rules may still be bad, because 
there is a flaw, vice or error somewhere. As a result of such a flaw, the apparent agreement is not a real 
agreement. 
Where there is no real agreement, the law has three remedies: 
Firstly: The agreement may be treated as of no effect and it will then be known as void agreement. 
Secondly: The law may give the party aggrieved the option of getting out of his bargain, and the contract is 
then known as voidable. 
Thirdly: The party at fault may be compelled to pay damages to the other party. 
(a) Void Agreement  
A void agreement is one which is destitute of all legal effects. It cannot be enforced and confers no rights on 
EP-EBCL 
486 
either party. It is really not a contract at all, it is non-existent. Technically the words ‘void contract’ are a 
contradiction in terms. But the expression provides a useful label for describing the situation that arises when 
a ‘contract’ is claimed but in fact does not exist. For example, a minors contract is void. 
(b) Voidable Contract  
A voidable contract is one which a party can put to an end. He can exercise his option, if his consent was not 
free. The contract will, however be binding, if he does not exercise his option to avoid it within a reasonable 
time. The consent of a party is not free and so he is entitled to avoid the contract, if he has given his cosent 
due to misrepresentation, fraud, coercion or undue influence. 
(c) Illegal Agreement 
An illegal agreement is one which, like the void agreement has no legal effects as between the immediate 
parties. Further, transactions collateral to it also become tainted with illegality and are, therefore, not 
enforceable. Parties to an unlawful agreement cannot get any help from a Court of law, for no polluted hands 
shall touch the pure fountain of justice. On the other hand, a collateral transaction can be supported by a 
void agreement. 
For example, one party may have deceived the other party, or in some other way there may be no genuine 
consent. The parties may be labouring under a mistake, or one or both the parties may be incapable of 
making a contract. Again, the agreement may be illegal or physically impossible. All these are called “the 
FLAWS in contract or the VICES of contract”. 
The chief flaws in contract are: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(i) Flaw in Capacity Capacity and Persons 
In law, persons are either natural or artificial. Natural persons are human beings and artificial persons are 
corporations. Contractual capacity or incapacity is an incident of personality. 
The general rule is that all natural persons have full capacity to make binding contracts. But the Indian 
Contract Act, 1872 admits an exception in the case of: 
 
(i) minors, 
 
(ii) lunatics, and 
 
(iii) persons disqualified from contracting by any law to which they are subject. 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
487 
These persons are not competent to contract. Section 11 provides that every “person is competent to contract 
who is of the age of majority according to the law to which he is subject, and who is of sound mind, and is not 
disqualified from contracting by any law to which he is subject”. A valid agreement requires that both the parties 
should understand the legal implications of their conduct. Thus, both must have a mature mind. The legal 
yardstick to measure maturity according to the law of contract is, that both should be major and of sound mind 
and if not, the law would presume that the maturity of their mind has not reached to the extent of visualising the 
pros and cons of their acts, hence, a bar on minors and lunatics competency to contract. 
The contractual capacity of a corporation depends on the manner in which it was created. 
Minor’s Contract 
According to the Indian Majority Act, 1875, a minor is a person, male or female, who has not completed the 
age of 18 years. In case a guardian has been appointed to the minor or where the minor is under the 
guardianship of the Court of Wards, the person continues to be a minor until he completes his age of 21 
years. According to the Indian Contract Act, no person is competent to enter into a contract who is not of the 
age of majority. It was finally laid down by the Privy Council in the leading case of Mohori Bibi v. 
DharmodasGhose, (1903) 30 Cal. 539, that a minor has no capacity to contract and minors contract is 
absolutely void. In this case, X, a minor borrowed Rs. 20,000 from Y, a money lender. As a security for the 
money advanced, X executed a mortgage in Y’s favour. When sued by Y, the Court held that the contract by 
X was void and he cannot be compelled to repay the amount advanced by him. 
Indian Courts have applied this decision to those cases where the minor has incurred any liability or where 
the liabilities on both sides are outstanding. In such cases, the minor is not liable. But if the minor has carried 
out his part of the contract, then, the Courts have held, that he can proceed against the other party. The 
rationale is to protect minors interest. According to the Transfer of Property Act, a minor cannot transfer 
property but he can be a transferee (person accepting a transfer). This statutory provision is an illustration of 
the above principle. 
The following points must be kept in mind with respect to minors contract: 
 
(a) A minor’s contract is altogether void in law, and a minor cannot bind himself by a contract. If the 
minor has obtained any benefit, such as money on a mortgage, he cannot be asked to repay, nor 
can his mortgaged property be made liable to pay. 
 
(b) Since the contract is void ab initio, it cannot be ratified by the minor on attaining the age of majority. 
 
(c) Estoppel is an important principle of the law of evidence. To explain, suppose X makes a statement 
to Y and intends that the latter should believe and act upon it. Later on, X cannot resile from this 
statement and make a new one. 
 
 In otherwords, X will be estopped from denying his previous statement. But a minor can always 
plead minority and is not estopped from doing so even where he had produced a loan or entered 
into some other contract by falsely representing that he was of full age, when in reality he was a 
minor. 
 
 But where the loan was obtained by fraudulent representation by the minor or some property was 
sold by him and the transactions are set aside as being void, the Court may direct the minor to 
restore the property to the other party. 
 
 For example, a minor fraudulently overstates his age and takes delivery of a motor car after 
executing a promissory note in favour of the trader for its price. The minor cannot be compelled to 
pay the amount to the promissory note, but the Court on equitable grounds may order the minor to 
EP-EBCL 
488 
return the car to the trader, if it is still with the minor. 
 
 Thus, according to Section 33 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 the Court may, if the minor has 
received any benefit under the agreement from the other party require him to restore, so far as may 
be such benefit to the other party, to the extent to which he or his estate has been benefited 
thereby. 
 
(d) A minors estate is liable to pay a reasonable price for necessaries supplied to him or to anyone 
whom the minor is bound to support (Section 68 of the Act). 
 
 The necessaries supplied must be according to the position and status in life of the minor and must 
be things which the minor actually needs. The following have also been held as necessaries in 
India. 
 
 Costs incurred in successfully defending a suit on behalf of a minor in which his property was in 
jeopardy; costs incurred in defending him in a prosecution; and money advanced to a Hindu minor 
to meet his marriage expenses have been held to be necessaries. 
 
(e) An agreement by a minor being void, the Court will never direct specific performance of the 
contract. 
 
(f) A minor can be an agent, but he cannot be a principal nor can he be a partner. He can, however, be 
admitted to the benefits of a partnership. 
 
(g) Since a minor is never personally liable, he cannot be adjudicated as an insolvent. 
 
(h) An agreement by a parent or guardian entered into on behalf of the minor is binding on him 
provided it is for his benefit or is for legal necessity. For, the guardian of a minor, may enter into 
contract for marriage on behalf of the minor, and such a contract would be good in law and an 
action for its breach would lie, if the contract is for the benefit of the minor (Rose Fernandez v. 
Joseph Gonsalves, 48 Bom. L. R. 673) e.g., if the parties are of the community among whom it is 
customary for parents to contract marriage for their children. The contract of apprenticeship is also 
binding. 
 
 However, it has been held that an agreement for service, entered into by a father on behalf of his 
daughter who is a minor, is not enforceable at law (Raj Rani v. PremAdib, (1948) 51 Bom. L.R. 
256). 
Lunatics Agreement (Section 2) 
A person of unsound mind is a lunatic. That is to say for the purposes of making contract, a person is of 
unsound mind if at the time when he makes the contract, he is incapable of understanding it and of forming 
rational judgment as to its effect upon his interests. 
A person of unsound mind cannot enter into a contract. A lunatics agreement is therefore void. But if he 
makes a contract when he is of sound mind, i.e., during lucid intervals, he will be bound by it. 
A sane man who is delirious from fever, or who is so drunk that he cannot understand the terms of a 
contract, or form a rational judgement as to its effect on his interests cannot contract whilst such delirium or 
state of drunkenness lasts. A person under the influence of hypnotism is temporarily of unsound mind. 
Mental decay brought by old age or disease also comes within the definition. 
Agreement by persons of unsound mind are void. But for necessaries supplied to a lunatic or to any member 
of his family, the lunatics estate, if any, will be liable. There is no personal liability incurred by the lunatic. 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
489 
If a contract entered into by a lunatic or person of unsound mind is for his benefit, it can be enforced (for the 
benefit) against the other party but not vice-versa (Jugal Kishore v. Cheddu, (1903) l All. L.J 43). 
Persons Disqualified from Entering into Contract 
Some statues disqualify certain persons governed by them, to enter into a contract. For example, Oudh Land 
Revenue Act provides that where a person in Oudh is declared as a ‘disqualified proprietor under the Act, he 
is incompetent to alienate his property. 
Alien Enemies 
A person who is not an Indian citizen is an alien. An alien may be either an alien friend or a foreigner whose 
sovereign or State is at peace with India, has usually contractual capacity of an Indian citizen. On the 
declaration of war between his country and India he becomes an alien enemy. A contract with an alien 
enemy becomes unenforceable on the outbreak of war. 
For the purposes of civil rights, an Indian citizen of the subject of a neutral state who is voluntarily resident in 
hostile territory or is carrying on business there is an alien enemy. Trading with an alien enemy is considered 
illegal, being against public policy. 
Foreign Sovereigns and Ambassadors 
Foreign sovereigns and accredited representatives of foreign states, i.e., Ambassadors, High 
Commissioners, enjoy a special privilege in that they cannot be sued in Indian Courts, unless they voluntarily 
submit to the jurisdiction of the Indian Courts. Foreign Sovereign Governments can enter into contracts 
through agents residing in India. In such cases the agent becomes personally responsible for the 
performance of the contracts. 
Professional Persons 
In England, barristers-at law are prohibited by the etiquette of their profession from suing for their fees. So 
also are the Fellow and Members of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons. But they can sue and be 
sued for all claims other than their professional fees. In India, there is no such disability and a barrister, who 
is in the position of an advocate with liberty both to act and plead, has a right to contract and to sue for his 
fees (Nihal Chand v. Dilawar Khan, 1933 All. L.R. 417). 
Corporations 
A corporation is an artificial person created by law, e.g., a company registered under the Companies Act, 
public bodies created by statute, such as Municipal Corporation of Delhi. A corporation exists only in 
contemplation of law and has no physical shape or form. 
The Indian Contract Act does not speak about the capacity of a corporation to enter into a contract. But if 
properly incorporated, it has a right to enter into a contract. It can sue and can be sued in its own name. 
There are some contracts into which a corporation cannot enter without its seal, and others not at all. A 
company, for instance, cannot contract to marry. Further, its capacity and powers to contract are limited by 
its charter or memorandum of association. Any contract beyond such power in ultra vires and void. 
Married Women 
In India there is no difference between a man and a woman regarding contractual capacity. A woman 
married or single can enter into contracts in the same ways as a man. She can deal with her property in any 
manner she likes, provided, of course, she is a major and is of sound mind. 
EP-EBCL 
490 
Under the English law, before the passing of the Law Reform (Married Women and Tortfeasors) Act, 1935, a 
husband was responsible for his wifes contracts but since 1935 this liability no longer arises unless the wife 
is acting as the husbands agent. Now, therefore, even in England a married woman has full contractual 
capacity, and can sue and be sued in her own name. 
Flaw in Consent 
The basis of a contract is agreement, i.e., mutual consent. In other words, the parties should mean the 
something in the same sense and agree voluntarily. It is when there is consent, that the parties are said to be 
consensus ad idem i.e. their minds have met. Not only consent is required but it must be a free consent. 
Consent is not free when it has been caused by coercion, undue influence, misrepresentation, fraud or 
mistake. These elements if present, may vitiate the contract. 
When this consent is wanting, the contract may turn out to be void or voidable according to the nature of the flaw 
in consent. Where there is no consent, there can be no contract as in the case of mutual mistake. Where there is 
consent, but it is not free, a contract is generally voidable at the option of the party whose consent is not free. In 
the case of misrepresentation, fraud, coercion, undue influence, the consent of one of the parties is induced or 
caused by the supposed existence of a fact which did not exist. 
(ii) Mistake (Sections 20 and 21) 
The law believes that contracts are made to be performed. The whole structure of business depends on this 
as the businessmen depend on the validity of contracts. Accordingly, the law says that it will not aid any one 
to evade consequences on the plea that he was mistaken. 
On the other hand, the law also realises that mistakes do occur, and that these mistakes are so fundamental 
that there may be no contract at all. If the law recognises mistake in contract, the mistake will render the 
contract void. 
Effect of Mistake 
A mistake in the nature of miscalculation or error of judgement by one or both the parties has no effect on the 
validity of the contract. For example, if A pays an excessive price for goods under a mistake as to their true 
value, the contract is binding on him (Leaf v. International Galleries (1950) 1 All E.R. 693). 
Therefore, mistake must be a “vital operative mistake”, i.e. it must be a mistake of fact which is fundamental 
to contract. 
To be operative so as to render the contract void, the mistake must be: 
 
(a) of fact, and not of law or opinion; 
 
(b) the fact must be essential to agreement, i.e., so fundamental as to negative the agreement; and 
 
(c) must be on the part of both the parties. 
Thus, where both the parties to an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to 
agreement, the agreement is void (Section 20). Such a mistake prevents the formation of any contract at all 
and the Court will declare it void. For example, A agrees to buy from B a certain horse. It turns out that the 
horse was dead at the time of bargain though neither party was aware of the fact. The agreement is void. 
Mistake of Law and Mistake of Fact 
Mistakes are of two kinds: (i) mistake of law, and (ii) mistake of fact. If there is a mistake of law of the land, 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
491 
the contract is binding because everyone is deemed to have knowledge of law of the land and ignorance of 
law is no excuse (ignorantia juris non-excusat). 
But mistake of foreign law and mistake of private rights are treated as mistakes of fact and are execusable. 
The law of a foreign country is to be proved in Indian Courts as ordinary facts. So mistake of foreign law 
makes the contract void. Similarly, if a contract is made in ignorance of private right of a party, it would be 
void, e.g., where A buys property which already belongs to him. 
Mutual or Unilateral Mistake 
Mistake must be mutual or bilateral, i.e., it must be on the part of both parties. A unilateral mistake, i.e., 
mistake on the part of only one party, is generally of no effect unless (i) it concerns some fundamental fact 
and (ii) the other party is aware of the mistake. For this reason, error of judgement on the part of one of the 
parties has no effect and the contract will be valid. 
Mutual or Common Mistake as to Subject-matter 
A contract is void when the parties to it assume that a certain state of things exist which does not actually 
exist or in their ignorance the contract means one thing to one and another thing to the other, and they 
contract subject to that assumption or under that ignorance. There is a mistake on the part of both the 
parties. Such a mistake may relate to the existence of the subject matter, its identity, quantity or quality. 
 
(a) Mistake as to existence of the subject matter: Where both parties believe the subject matter of the 
contract to be in existence but in fact, it is not in existence at the time of making the contract, there 
is mistake and the contract is void. 
 
 In Couturier v. Hastie (1856), there was a contact to buy cargo described as shipped from port A to 
port B and believed to be at sea which in fact got lost earlier unknown to the parties and hence not 
in existence at the time of the contract. Held, the contract was void due to the parties mistake. 
 
(b) Mistake as to identity of the subject matter: Where the parties are not in agreement to the identity of 
the subject matter, i.e., one means one thing and the other means another thing, the contract is 
void; there is no consensus ad idem. 
 
 In Raffles v. Wichelhhaks (1864), A agreed to buy from B a cargo of cotton to arrive “ex Peerless 
from Bombay”. There were two ships called “Peerless” sailing from Bombay, one arriving in October 
and the other in December. A meant the earlier ship and B the latter. Held, the contract was void for 
mistake. 
 
(c) Mistake as to quantity of the subject matter: There may be a mistake as to quantity or extent of the 
subject matter which will render the contract void even if the mistake was caused by the negligence 
of a third-party. 
 
 In Henkel v. Pape (1870), P wrote to H inquiring the price of rifles and suggested that he might buy 
as many as fifty. On receipt of a reply he wired send three rifles. Due to the mistake of the telegraph 
clerk the message transmitted to H was send the rifles. H despatched 50 rifles. Held, there was no 
contract between the parties. 
 
(d) Mistake as to quality of the subject-matter or promise: Mistake as to quality raises difficult questions. 
If the mistake is on the part of both the parties the contract is void. But if the mistake is only on the 
part of one party difficulty arises. 
The general rule is that a party to a contract does not owe any duty to the other party to discloses all the 
facts in his possession during negotiations. Even if he knows that the other party is ignorant of or under 
EP-EBCL 
492 
some misapprehension as to an important fact, he is under no obligation to enlighten him. Each party must 
protect his own interests unaided. In contract of sale of goods, this rule is summed up in the maxim caveat 
emptor (Let the buyer beware.) The seller is under no duty to reveal the defects of his goods to the buyer, 
subject to certain conditions. 
Unilateral Mistake as to Nature of the Contract 
The general rule is that a person who signs an instrument is bound by its terms even if he has not read it. But 
a person who signs a document under a fundamental mistake as to its nature (not merely as to its contents) 
may have it avoided provided the mistake was due to either- 
 
(a) the blindness, illiteracy, or senility of the person signing, or 
 
(b) a trick or fraudulent misrepresentation as to the nature of the document. 
Unilateral Mistake as to the Identity of the Person Contracted With 
It is a rule of law that if a person intends to contract with A, B cannot give himself any right under it. Hence, 
when a contract is made in which personalities of the contracting parties are or may be of importance, no 
other person can interpose and adopt the contract. For example, where M intends to contract only with A but 
enters into contract with B believing him to be A, the contract is vitiated by mistake as there is no consensus 
ad idem.  
Mistake as to the identity of the person with whom the contract is made will operate to nullify the contract 
only if: 
 
(i) the identity is for material importance to the contracts; and 
 
(ii) the mistake is known to the other person, i.e., he knows that it is not intended that he should 
become a party to the contract. 
In Cundy  v. Lindsay [(1878) 3 A.C. 459, one Blenkarn posing as a reputed trader Blankiron, placed an order for 
some goods with M/s Lindsay and Co. The company, thought that it is dealing with Blankiron and supplied the 
goods. Blenkarn sold the goods to Cundy and did not pay to Lindsay. The latter sued Cundy. The Court held 
that there was no contract between Lindsay and Blenkarn and therefore Cundy has no title to the goods. 
(iii) Misrepresentation(Section 18) 
The term “misrepresentation” is ordinarily used to connote both “innocent misrepresentation” and “dishonest 
misrepresentation”. Misrepresentation may, therefore, be either (i) Innocent misrepresentation, or (ii) Wilful 
misrepresentation with intent to deceive and is called fraud. 
Innocent Misrepresentation 
If a person makes a representation believing what he says is true he commits innocent misrepresentation. 
Thus, any false representation, which is made with an honest belief in its truth is innocent. The effect of 
innocent misrepresentation is that the party misled by it can avoid the contract, but cannot sue for damages 
in the normal circumstances. 
But in order to avoid a contract on the ground of misrepresentation, it is necessary to prove that: 
 
(i) there was a representation or assertion, 
 
(ii) such assertion induced the party aggrieved to enter into the contract. 
 
(iii) the assertion related to a matter of fact ( and not of law as ignorance of law is no excuse). 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
493 
 
(iv) the statement was not a mere opinion or hearsay, or commendation (i.e., reasonable praise). For 
example an advertisement saying, “washes whiter than the whitest". 
 
(v) the statement which has become or turned out to be untrue, was made with an honest belief in its 
truth. 
Damages for Innocent Misrepresentation 
Generally the injured party can only avoid the contract and cannot get damages for innocent 
misrepresentation. But in the following cases, damages are obtainable: 
 
(i) From a promoter or director who makes innocent misrepresentation in a company prospectus 
inviting the public to subscribe for the shares in the company; 
 
(ii) Against an agent who commits a breach of warranty of authority: 
 
(iii) From a person who (at the Courts discretion) is estopped from denying a statement he has made 
where he made a positive statement intending that it should be relied upon and the innocent party 
did rely upon it and thereby suffered damages; 
 
(iv) Negligent representation made by one person to another between whom a confidential relationship, 
like that of a solicitor and client exists.  
(iv) Wilful Misrepresentation or Fraud(Section 17) 
Fraud is an untrue statement made knowingly or without belief in its truth or recklessly, carelessly, whether it 
be true or false with the intent to deceive. The chief ingredients of a fraud are: 
 
(i) a false representation or assertion; 
 
(ii) of fact (and not a mere opinion), 
 
(iii) made with the intention that it should be acted upon, 
 
(iv) the representation must have actually induced the other party to enter into the contract and so 
deceived him, 
 
(v) the party deceived must thereby be damnified, for there is no fraud without damages, and 
 
(vi) the statement must have been made either with the knowledge that it was false or without belief in 
its truth or recklessly without caring whether it was true or false. 
It is immaterial whether the representation takes effect by false statement or with concealment. The party 
defrauded can avoid the contract and also claim damages. 
Mere silence as to facts likely to affect the willingness of a person to enter into a contract is not fraud, unless 
silence is in itself equivalent to speech, or where it is the duty of the person keeping silent to speak as in the 
cases of contracts uberrimaefidei- (contracts requiring utmost good faith). 
Contracts Uberrimae Fidei 
There are contracts in which the law imposes a special duty to act with the utmost good faith i.e., to disclose 
all material information. Failure to disclose such information will render the contract voidable at the option of 
the other party. 
Contracts uberrimaefidei are: 
 
(a) Contract of insurance of all kinds: The assured must disclose to the insurer all material facts and 
EP-EBCL 
494 
whatever he states must be correct and truthful. 
 
(b) Company prospectus: When a company invites the public to subscribe for its shares, it is under 
statutory obligation to disclose truthfully the various matters set out in the Companies Act. Any 
person responsible for non-disclosure of any of these matters is liable to damages. Also, the 
contract to buy shares is voidable where there is a material false statement or non- disclosure in the 
prospectus. 
 
(c) Contract for the sale of land: The vendor is under a duty to the purchaser to show good title to the 
land he has contracted to sell. 
 
(d) Contracts of family arrangements: When the members of a family make agreements or 
arrangements for the settlement of family property, each member of the family must make full 
disclosure of every material fact within his knowledge. 
Difference between Fraud and Innocent Misrepresentation 
 
1. Fraud implies an intent to deceive, which is lacking if it is innocent misrepresentation. 
 
2. In case of misrepresentation and fraudulent silence, the defendant can take a good plea that the 
plaintiff had the means of discovering the truth with ordinary diligence. This argument is not 
available if there is fraud (Section 19- exception). 
 
3. In misrepresentation the plaintiff can avoid or rescind the contract. In fraud, the plaintiff can claim 
damages as well. 
 
4. If there is fraud, it may lead to prosecution for an offence of cheating under the Indian Penal Code. 
(v) Coercion  
Coercion as defined in Section 15 means “the committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the 
Indian Penal Code, or unlawful detaining or threatening to detain, any property to the prejudice of any person 
whatever with the intention of causing any person to enter into an agreement”. Simply stated, the doing of 
any act forbidden by the Indian Penal Code is coercion even though such an act is done in a place where the 
Indian Penal Code is not in force. If A at the point of a pistol asks B to execute a promissory note in his 
favour and B to save his life does so he can avoid this agreement as his consent was not free. Even a threat 
to third-party, e.g., where A compels B to sign a document threatening to harm C, in case B does not sign 
would also amount to coercion. 
It has been held that mere threat by one person to another to prosecute him does not amount to coercion. 
There must be a contract made under the threat and that contract should be one sought to be avoided 
because of coercion (Ramchandra v. Bank of Kohlapur, 1952 Bom. 715). It may be pointed out that coercion 
may proceed from any person and may be directed against any person, even a stranger and also against 
goods, e.g., by unlawful detention of goods. 
(vi) Undue Influence 
Under Section 16 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, a contract is said to be produced by undue influence 
“where the relations subsisting between the parties are such that one of the parties is in a position to 
dominate the will of the other and uses that position to obtain an unfair advantage over the other”. 
The elements of undue influence are (i) a dominant position, and (ii) the use of it to obtain an unfair 
advantage. The words “unfair advantage” do not limit the jurisdiction to cases where the transaction would be 
obviously unfair as between persons dealing on an equal footing. In the words of Lord Kingston, “the 
principle applies to every case where influence is acquired and abused where confidence is reposed and 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
495 
betrayed”. 
Sub-section (2) of Section 16 provides that a person is deemed to be in a position to dominate the will of 
another— 
 
(a) Where he holds a real or apparent authority over the other or where he stands in a fiduciary relation 
to the other, e.g., minor and guardian; trustee and beneficiary; solicitor and client. There is, 
however, no presumption of undue influence in the relation of creditor and debtor, husband and wife 
(unless the wife is a parda-nishin woman) and landlord and tenant. In these cases the party has to 
prove that undue influence has been exercised on him, there being no presumption as to existence 
of undue influence. 
 
(b) Where he makes a contract with a person whose mental capacity is temporarily or permanently 
affected by reason of age, illness or mental or bodily distress e.g., doctor and patient. 
Illustration 
A, having advanced money to his son B, during his minority, upon B’s coming of age obtains, by misuse of 
parental influence a bond upon B for a greater amount than the sum due in respect of the advance. A 
employs undue influence. 
A, a man enfeebled by disease or age is induced by B’s influence over him as his medical attendant, to 
agree to pay B an unreasonable sum for his professional services. B employs undue influence. 
A parent stands in a fiduciary relation towards his child and any transaction between them by which any 
benefit is procured by the parent to himself or to a third party, at the expense of the child will be viewed with 
jealousy by Courts of Equity and the burden will be on the parent or third-party claiming the benefit of 
showing that the child while entering into the transaction had independent advice, that he thoroughly 
understood the nature of transaction and that he was removed from all undue influence when the gift was 
made (Marim Bibi v. Cassim Ebrahim (1939) 184 I.C. 171 (1939) A.I.R. 278). 
Where there is a presumption of undue influence, the presumption can be rebutted by showing that 
 
(i) full disclosure of all material facts was made, 
 
(ii) the consideration was adequate, and 
 
(iii) the weaker party was in receipt of independent legal advice. 
Transaction with parda-nishin women 
The expression ‘parda-nishin denotes complete seclusion. Thus, a woman who goes to a Court and gives 
evidence, who fixes rents with tenants and collects rents, who communicates when necessary, in matters of 
business, with men other than members of her own family, could not be regarded as a parda-nishin woman 
(Ismail Musafee v. Hafiz Boo (1906) 33 Cal. LR 773 and 33 I.A. 86). The principles to be applied to 
transactions with parda-nishin woman are founded on equity and good conscience and accordingly a person 
who contracts with parda-nishin woman has to prove that no undue influence was used and that she had free 
and independent advice, fully understood the contents of the contract and exercised her free will. “The law 
throws around her a special cloak of protection” (Kali Baksh v. Ram Gopal (1914) L.R. 41 I.A. 23, 28-29, 36 
All 81, 89). 
Unconscionable transactions: An unconscionable transaction is one which makes an exorbitant profit of the 
others distress by a person who is in a dominant position. Merely the fact that the rate of interest is very high 
in a money lending transaction shall not make it unconscionable. But if the rate of interest is very exorbitant 
EP-EBCL 
496 
and the Court regards the transaction unconscionable, the burden of proving that no undue influence was 
exercised lies on the creditor. It has been held that urgent need of money on the part of the borrower does 
not itself place the lender in a position to dominate his will within the meaning of this Section (Sunder Koerv. 
Rai Sham Krishen (1907) 34 Cal. 150, C.R. 34 I.A. 9). 
(vii) Legality of Object 
One of the requisites of a valid contract is that the object should be lawful. Section 10 of the Indian Contract 
Act, 1872, provides, “All agreements are contracts if they are made by free consent of parties competent to 
contract for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object...” Therefore, it follows that where the 
consideration or object for which an agreement is made is unlawful, it is not a contract. 
Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 provides that the consideration or object of an agreement is 
lawful unless it is 
 
(i) forbidden by law; or 
 
(ii) it is of such nature that if permitted it would defeat the provisions of law; or 
 
(iii) is fraudulent; or 
 
(iv) involves or implies injury to the person or property of another; or 
 
(v) the Court regards it an immoral or opposed to public policy. 
In each of these cases the consideration or object of an agreement is said to be unlawful. Every agreement 
of which the object or consideration is unlawful is void. 
Illustration 
 
(i) X, Y and Z enter into an agreement for the division among them of gains acquired by them by fraud. 
The agreement is void as its object is unlawful. 
 
(ii) X promises to obtain for Y an employment in the Government service and Y promises to pay Rs. 
1,500 to X. The agreement is void, as the consideration for it is unlawful. 
 
(iii) X promises to Y to drop a prosecution which he has instituted against Y for robbery, and Y promises 
to restore the value of the things taken. The agreement is void as its object is unlawful. 
 
(iv) A who is B’s mukhtr promises to exercise his influence, as such, with B in favour of C and C 
promises to pay Rs. 1,000 to A. The agreement is void because it is immoral. 
 
(v) An agreement by the proprietors of a newspaper to indemnify the printers against claims arising 
from libels printed in the newspaper is void as it implies or involves injury to the person of another. 
Void and Illegal Contracts 
A void contract is one which is destitue of legal effects altogether. An illegal contract too has no legal effect 
as between the immediate parties to the contract, but has the further effect of tainting the collateral contracts 
also with illegality. For instance A borrows from B `1,000 for lending to C a minor. The contract between A 
and C is void, but B can nevertheless recover the money from A, On the other hand, if A had borrowed 
`1,000 from B to buy a pistol to shoot C, the question whether B can recover the money hinges on whether B 
was aware of the purpose for which money was borrowed. If B had knowledge of the illegal purpose, he 
cannot recover. Therefore, it may be said that all illegal agreements are void but all void agreements are not 
necessarily illegal. 
Consequence of Illegal Agreements 
 
(i) an illegal agreement is entirely void; 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
497 
 
(ii) no action can be brought by a party to an illegal agreement. The maxim is “Ex turpi cause non-oritur 
action” - from an evil cause, no action arises; 
 
(iii) money paid or property transferred under an illegal agreement cannot be recovered. The maxim is 
in parti delicto potierest condition defendeties- In cases of equal guilt, more powerful is the condition 
of the defendant; 
 
(iv) where an agreement consist of two parts, one part legal and other illegal, and the legal parts is 
separable from the illegal one, then the Court will enforce the legal one. If the legal and the illegal 
parts cannot be separated the whole agreement is illegal; and 
 
(v) any agreement which is collateral to an illegal agreement is also tainted with illegality and is treated 
as being illegal, even though it would have been lawful by itself (Film Pratapchand v. Firm Kotri Re. 
AIR (1975) S.C. 1223). 
Exception to General Rule of no Recovery of Money or Property 
In the following cases, a party to an illegal agreement may sue to recover money paid or property transferred: 
 
(a) Where the transfer is not in pari delicto (equally guilty) with the defendant, i.e. the transferee. For 
example, where A is induced to enter into an illegal agreement by the fraud of B, A may recover the 
money paid if he did not know that the contract was illegal. 
 
(b) If the plaintiff can frame a cause of action entirely dependent of the contract. 
 
(c) Where a substantial part of the illegal transaction has not been carried out and the plaintiff is truly 
and genuinely repentant. (Bigos v. Bonstead(1951), All E.R. 92). 
Agreements Void as being Opposed to Public Policy 
The head public policy covers a wide range of topics. Agreements may offend public policy by tending to the 
prejudice of the State in times of war, by tending to the abuse of justice or by trying to impose unreasonable 
and inconvenient restrictions on the free choice of individuals in marriage, or their liberty to exercise lawful 
trade or calling. The doctrine of public policy is a branch of Common Law and like any other branch of 
Common Law it is governed by the precedents [Gherulal Parakh v. MahadeodasMaiya (1959) 2 S.C.R. 
(Suppl.) 406; AIR 1959 S.C. 781]. The doctrine of public policy is not to be extended beyond the classes of 
cases already covered by it and no Court can invent a new head of public policy [Lord Halsbury, Janson v. 
Driefontien Consolidated Mines (1902) A.C. 484, 491]. It has been said by the House of Lords that public 
policy is always an unsafe and treacherous ground for legal decisions. Even if it is possible for Courts to 
evolve a new head of public policy, it should be done under extraordinary circumstances giving rise to 
incontestable harm to the society. 
The following agreements are void as being against public policy but they are not illegal: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Agreement in restrain 
of parental rights 
Agreement in 
restraint of 
trade 
Agreement in 
restraint of 
marriage 
Agreements in 
restraint of 
personal 
freedom are void 
Marriage 
brocage or 
brokerage 
Agreements 
EP-EBCL 
498 
 
(a) Agreement in restrain of parental rights: An agreement by which a party deprives himself of the 
custody of his child is void. 
 
(b) Agreement in restraint of marriage: An agreement not to marry at all or not to marry any particular 
person or class of persons is void as it is in restraint of marriage. 
 
(c) Marriage brokerage or brokerage Agreements: An agreement to procure marriage for reward is 
void. Where a purohit (priest) was promised Rs. 200 in consideration of procuring a wife for the 
defendant, the promise was held void as opposed to public policy, and the purohit could not recover 
the promised sum. 
 
(d) Agreements in restraint of personal freedom are void: Where a man agreed with his money lender not 
to change his residence, or his employment or to part with any of his property or to incur any obligation 
on credit without the consent of the money lender, it was held that the agreement was void. 
 
(e) Agreement in restraint of trade: An agreement in restraint of trade is one which seeks to restrict a 
person from freely exercising his trade or profession. 
AGREEMENTS IN RESTRAINT OF TRADE VOID 
Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act states that every agreement by which any one is restrained from 
exercising a lawful profession, trade or business of any kind, is, to that extent, void. 
This Section is not happily worded and has been criticised by many authors. It appears from the wording that 
every kind of restraint, whether total or partial falls within the prohibition of this Section. In English law the 
Courts have held that if a restraint is reasonable, it will be valid. Leading case on his point is Nordenfelt v. 
Maxim Nordenfelt Guns Co., (1894) A.C. 535. N was an inventor and a manufacturer of guns and 
ammunition. He sold his world-wide business to M and promised not to manufacture guns anywhere in the 
world for 25 years. The House of Lords held that the restraint was reasonable as it was no more than is 
necessary for the protection of the company, the contract was binding. Whether a restraint is reasonable or 
not depends upon the facts of each case. 
Our courts are not consistent on the point whether reasonable restraints are permitted or not. In Madhub 
Chunder v. RaCoomar(1874) 14 Bang. L.R. 76, A paid Rs. 900 to B’s workman. B undertook to stop his 
business in a particular locality in Calcutta. He did not keep his promise. A’s suit for the sum was dismissed 
since the agreement was void under Section 27. The reasonableness or otherwise of the restraint was not 
discussed. However, if a restrictive meaning is adopted, most of the ordinary mercantile agreements may be 
hit. Thus, the Courts have held that if the restraint is one which is really necessary for the carrying on 
business, the same is not prohibited. In Mackenzie v. Sitarmiah, (1891) 15 Mad. 79, A agreed to sell to B all 
the salt he manufactured and B agreed to buy such salt. A further agreed not to sell salt to third-parties. The 
Court held that the agreement was valid. 
Other type of restrains is personal covenants between an employer and his employee whereby the latter 
agrees not to compete with the former or serve with any of his competitors after employment. This issue 
came before the Supreme Court in Niranjan Shanker Golikari v. The Century Spinning and Manufacturing 
Co. Ltd., AIR 1967 S.C. 1098. In this case N entered into a bond with the company to serve for a period of 
five years. In case, N leaves his job earlier and joins elsewhere with companys competitor within five years, 
he was liable for damages. N was imparted the necessary training but he left the job and joined another 
company. The former employer instituted a suit against N. The Supreme Court, held that the restraint was 
necessary for the protection of the companys interests and not such as the Court would refuse to enforce. 
In other case, it has been reiterated that the restriction should be reasonable taking into account the facts 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
499 
and circumstances of the case. In Superintendence Company of India Ltd. v. Krishna Murgai [(1981) 2 SCC 
246], the Supreme Court laid down that a restraint beyond the term of service would be void and the only 
ground on which it can be justified is by showing it is necessary for the protection of the employers goodwill. 
The words “to the extent” in Section 27 make it clear that if in an agreement there are some convenants 
which are prohibited whereas the others are not and if the two parts can be separated then only those 
convenants which operate as restraint of trade would be void and not whole of the agreement itself. To 
illustrate, in Brahmputra Tea Co. Ltd. v. Scarth(1885) I.L.R. Cal. 545, the employee agreed with the employer 
firstly, not to compete with latter after leaving the job and, secondly, not to injure employer’s interest during 
employment. The Court held that the first condition is a restraint of trade but the second is binding. 
When Contracts in Restraint of Trade Valid 
Prima facie every restraint of trade is void , but certain exceptions to this general rule are recognised. If a 
partial and reasonable restraint falls under any of the following exceptions, the contract will be enforceable: 
 
(a) Sale of goodwill: Where the seller of the goodwill of a business undertakes not to compete with the 
purchaser of the goodwill, the contract is enforceable provided the restraint appears to be 
reasonable as to territorial limits and the length of time. 
 
(b) Partners agreements: Section 11(2) of the Indian Partnership Act permits contracts between 
partners to provide that a partner shall not carry on any business other than that of the firm while he 
is a partner. 
 
(c) Section 36(2) and Section 54 of the Indian Partnership Act provide that a partner may make an 
agreement with his partners that on ceasing to be a partner he will not carry on any business similar 
to that of the firm within specified period or within specified limits. The agreement shall be binding if 
the restrictions are reasonable. 
Trade Combinations: An agreement, the object of which is to regulate business and not to restrain it is valid. 
Thus, an agreement in the nature of a business combination between traders or manufactures e.g. not to sell 
their goods below a certain price, to pool profits or output and to divide the same in an agreed proportion 
does not amount to a restraint of trade and is perfectly valid (Fraster& Co. v. Laxmi Narain, (1931) 63 All 
316). 
Negative stipulations in service agreements: An agreement of service by which a person binds himself during 
the term of the agreement not to take service with anyone else is not in restraint of lawful profession and is 
valid. 
WAGERING AGREEMENTS 
The literal meaning of the word “wager” is a “bet”. Wagerning agreements are nothing but ordinary betting 
agreements. For example, A and B enter into an agreement that if Englands Cricket Team wins the test 
match, A will pay B Rs. 100 and if it loses B will pay Rs. 100 to A. This is a wagering agreement and nothing 
can be recovered by winning party under the agreement. 
The essence of gaming and wagering is that one party is to win and the other to lose upon a future event 
which at the time of the contract is of an uncertain nature that is to say, if the event turns out one way A will 
lose; but if it turns out the other way he will win (Thacker v. Hardy, (1878) 4 OBD 685). 
Wagering Agreements Void 
In India except Mumbai, wagering agreements are void. In Mumbai, wagering agreements have been 
EP-EBCL 
500 
declared illegal by the Avoiding Wagers (Amendment) Act, 1865. Therefore, in Mumbai a wagering 
agreement being illegal, is void not only between the immediate parties, but taints and renders void all 
collateral agreements to it. 
Thus, A bets with B and losses, applies to C for a loan, who pays B in settlement of A’s losses. C cannot 
recover from A because this is money paid “under” or “in respect of” a wagering transaction which is illegal in 
Mumbai. But in respect of India such a transaction (i.e., betting) being only void, C could recover from A. Of 
course, if A refused to pay B the amount of the bet that he has lost, B could not sue A anywhere. Again, 
where an agent bets on behalf of his principal and looses and pays over the money to the winner, he cannot 
recover the money from his principal, if the transactions took place in Mumbai, but elsewhere he could 
recover. But if the agent wins, he must pay the winnings to the principal, as this money was received on 
behalf of the principal. 
Sometimes, commercial transactions assume the form of wagering contracts. The sample test to find out 
whether a particular transaction is a wager or a genuine commercial transaction is: “Where delivery of the 
goods sold is intended to be given and taken, it is valid contract, but where only the differences are intended 
to be paid, it will be a wagering contract and unenforceable”. 
In a wagering contract there must be mutuality in the sense that the gain of one party should be loss to the 
other on the happening of an uncertain event which is the subject matter of the contract. 
VOID AGREEMENTS 
The following types of agreements are void under Indian Contract Act: 
 
(a) Agreement by or with a minor or a person of unsound mind or a person disqualified to enter into a 
contract - Section 11; 
 
(b) Agreement made under a mistake of fact, material to the agreement on the part of the both the 
parties - Section 20. 
 
(c) An agreement of which the consideration or object is unlawful - Section 23. 
 
(d) If any part of a single consideration for one or more objects, or any one or any part of any one of

501 
A contract which ceases to be enforceable by law becomes void when it ceases to be enforceable - Section 2(j) 
A contract becomes void when, by reason of some event which the promisor could not prevent, the 
performance of the contract becomes impossible, e.g., by destruction of the subject- matter of the contract 
after the formation of the contract. 
A contract becomes void by reason of subsequent illegality. A in India agrees to supply goods to B in 
Pakistan. After the formation of the contract war breaks out between India and Pakistan and the supply of 
goods to Pakistan is prohibited by legislation. The contract becomes void. 
A contingent contract to do or not do to anything if an uncertain future event happens becomes void if the 
event becomes impossible. 
Where a contract is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party, the contract becomes void when the option 
is exercised by him. 
RESTITUTION 
When a contract becomes void, it is not to be performed by either party. But if any party has received any 
benefit under such a contract from the other party he must restore it or make compensation for it to the other 
party. A agrees to sell to B after 6 months a certain quantity of gold and receives `500 as advance. Soon 
after the agreement, private sales of gold are prohibited by law. The contract becomes void and A must 
return the sum of `500 to B. 
Restitution is also provided for by Section 65 where an agreement is discovered to be void. A pays `500 in 
consideration of B’s promising to marry, C, A’s daughter C is dead at the time of the promise. The agreement 
is discovered to be void and B must pay back `500. 
But there is no resolution where the parties are wholly incompetent to contract, e.g., where one of the parties 
is a minor. The minor cannot be asked to restore the benefit, e.g., a minor borrowed `1,000 from B, he 
cannot be asked to pay back `1,000 to B because the contract is void (Mohori Bibis case). 
CONTINGENT CONTRACT (Section 31) 
As per Section 31, a contingent contract is a contract to do or not to do something, if some event collateral to 
such contract, does or does not happen. For example, A contracts to sell B 10 bales of cotton for Rs. 20,000, 
if the ship by which they are coming returns safely. This is a contingent contract. 
Contract of insurance and contracts of indemnity and guarantee are popular instances of contingent 
contracts. 
Rules regarding contingent contracts 
The following rules are contained in Section 32-36: 
 
(a) Contracts contingent upon the happening of a future uncertain event cannot be enforced by law 
unless and until that event has happened. If the event becomes impossible, the contract becomes 
void - Section 32. 
 
(i) A makes a contract to buy B’s house if A survives C. This contract cannot be enforced by law 
unless and until C dies in A’s lifetime. 
 
(ii) A contracts to pay B a sum of money when B marries C, C dies without being married to B. The 
contract becomes void. 
EP-EBCL 
502 
 
(b) Contracts contingent upon the non-happening of an uncertain future event can be enforced when 
the happening of that event becomes impossible and not before - Section 33. 
 
 A contracts to pay B a certain sum of money if a certain ship does not return. The ship is sunk. The 
contract can be enforced when the ship sinks. 
 
(c) If a contract is contingent upon how a person will act at an unspecified time, the event shall be 
considered to become impossible when such person does anything which renders it impossible that 
he should so act within any definite time or otherwise than under further contingencies - Section 34. 
 
 A agrees to pay B Rs. 1,000 if B marries C. C marries D. The marriage of B to C must now be 
considered impossible although it is possible that D may die and C may afterwards marry B. 
 
(d) Contracts contingent on the happening of an event within a fixed time become void if, at the 
expiration of the time, such event has not happened, or if, before the time fixed, such event 
becomes impossible - Section 35. 
 
 A promises to pay B a sum of money if a certain ship returns with in a year. The contract may be 
enforced if the ship returns within the year, and becomes void if the ship is burnt within the year. 
 
(e) Contracts contingent upon the non-happening of an event within a fixed time may be enforced by 
law when the time fixed has expired and such event has not happened or before the time fixed has 
expired, if it becomes certain that such event will not happen - Section 35 
 
 A promises to pay B a sum of money if a certain ship does not return within the year. The contract 
may be enforced if the ship does not return within the year or is burnt within the year. 
 
(f) Contingent agreements to do or not to do anything if an impossible event happens, are void, whether 
the impossibility of the event is known or not known to the parties to the agreement at the time when it 
is made - Section 36. 
 
 A agrees to pay Rs. 1,000 to B if two straight lines should enclose a space. The agreement is void. 
CERTAIN RELATIONS RESEMBLING THOSE OF CONTRACT (QUASI CONTRACTS) 
 
Nature of Quasi-Contracts 
A valid contract must contain certain essential elements, such as offer and acceptance, capacity to contract, 
consideration and free consent. But sometimes the law implies a promise imposing obligations on one party 
and conferring right in favour of the other even when there is no offer, no acceptance, no consensus ad 
idem, and in fact, there is neither agreement nor promise. Such cases are not contracts in the strict sense, 
but the Court recognises them as relations resembling those of contracts and enforces them as if they were 
contracts, hence the term quasi- contracts (i.e., resembling a contract). 
A quasi-contract rests on the equitable principle that a person shall not be allowed to enrich himself unjustly 
at the expense of another. In truth, it is not a contract at all. It is an obligation which the law creates, in the 
absence of any agreement, when any person is in the possession of other persons money, or its equivalent, 
under such circumstances that in equity and good conscience he ought not to retain it, and which in justice 
and fairness belongs to another. It is the duty and not an agreement or intention which defines it. A very 
simple illustration is money paid under mistake. Equity demands that such money must be paid back. 
Quasi-Contracts or Implied Contracts under the Indian Contract Act 
The following types of quasi-contracts have been dealt within the Indian Contract Act— 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
503 
 
(a) Necessaries supplied to person incapable of contracting or to anyone whom he is illegally bound to 
support - Section 68. 
 
(b) Suit for money had and received - Section 69 and 72. 
 
(c) Quantum Meruit 
 
(d) Obligations of a finder of goods - Section 71. 
 
(e) Obligation of person enjoying benefit of a non-gratuitous act - Section 70 
Necessaries 
Contracts by minors and persons of unsound mind are void. However, Section 68 of the Indian Contract Act 
provides that their estates are liable to reimburse the trader, who supplies them with necessaries of life. 
Suit for money had and received 
The right to file a suit for the recovery of money may arise 
 
(a) Where the plaintiff paid money to the defendant (i) under a mistake, (ii) in pursuance of a contract 
the consideration for which has failed, or (iii) under coercion, oppression, extortion or other such 
means. 
 
 A debtor may recover, from a creditor the amount of an over-payment made to him by mistake. The 
mistake may be mistake of fact or a mistake of law. 
 
(b) Payment to third-party of money which another is bound to pay. For example, where A’s goods are 
wrongfully attached in order to realise arrears of Government revenue due by B, and A pays the 
amount to save his goods from being sold, he is entitled to recover the amount from B. 
 
(c) Money obtained by defendant from third-parties. For example, where an agent has obtained a 
secret commission or a fraudulent payment from a third-party, the principle can recover the amount 
from the agent. 
Quantum Meruit 
The expression “Quantum Meruit” literally means “as much as earned” or reasonable remuneration. It is used 
where a person claims reasonable remuneration for the services rendered by him when there was no 
express promise to pay the definite remuneration, Thus, the law implies reasonable compensation for the 
services rendered by a party if there are circumstances showing that these are to be paid for. 
The general rule is that where a party to a contract has not fully performed what the contract demands as a 
condition of payment, he cannot sue for payment for that which he has done. The contract has to be 
indivisible and the payment can be demanded only on the completion of the contract. 
But where one party who has performed part of his contract is prevented by the other from completing it, he 
may sue on a quantum meruit, for the value of what he has done. 
The claim on a quantum meruit arises when one party abandons the contract, or accepts the work done by 
another under a void contract. 
The party in default may also sue on a “quantum meruit” for what he has done if the contract is divisible and 
the other party has had the benefit of the part which has been performed. But if the contract is not divisible, 
the party at fault cannot claim the value of what he has done. 
EP-EBCL 
504 
Obligations of finder of lost goods 
The liability of a finder of goods belonging to someone else is that of a bailee. This means that he must take 
as much care of the goods as a man of ordinary prudence would take of his own goods of the same kind. So 
far as the real owner of the goods is concerned, the finder is only a bailee and must not appropriate the 
goods to his own use. If the owner is traced, he must return the goods to him. The finder is entitled to get the 
reward that may have been offered by the owner and also any expenses he may have incurred in protecting 
and preserving the property. 
Obligation of a person enjoying benefit of non-gratuitous act 
Section 70 of the Indian Contract Act provides that where a person lawfully does something for another 
person or delivers anything to him without any intention of doing so gratuitously and the other person accepts 
and enjoys the benefit thereof, the latter must compensate the former or restore to him the thing so 
delivered. For example, when one of the two joint tenants pays the whole rent to the landlord, he is entitled to 
compensation from his co-tenant, or if A, a tradesmen, leaves goods at B’s house by mistake and B treats 
the goods as his own, he is bound to pay A for them.  
DISCHARGE OR TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS 
A contract is said to be discharged or terminated when the rights and obligations arising out of a contract are 
extinguished. 
Contracts may be discharged or terminated by any of the following modes: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a) Performance of Contracts (Section 37) 
Section 37 of the Act provides that the parties to a contract must either perform or offer to perform their 
respective promises, unless such performance is dispensed with or excused under the provision of the 
Indian Contract Act, or any other law. In case of death of the promisor before performance, the 
representatives of the promisor are bound to perform the promise unless a contrary intention appears from 
the contract. 
Illustration 
X promises to deliver a horse to Y on a certain day on payment of Rs 1,000. X dies before that day. X’s 
representatives are bound to deliver the horse to Y and Y is bound is pay Rs. 1,000 to X’s representatives. 
Tender of Performance (Section 38) 
In case of some contracts, it is sometimes sufficient if the promisor performs his side of the contract. Then, if 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
505 
the performance is rejected,the promisor is discharged from further liability and may sue for the breach of 
contract if he so wishes. This is called discharge by tender. 
To be valid, a tender must fulfil the following conditions 
 
(a) it must be unconditional; 
 
(b) if must be made at a proper time and place; 
 
(c) it must be made under circumstances enabling the other party to ascertain that the party by whom it 
is made is able and willing then and there to do the whole of what he is bound, to do by his promise; 
 
(d) if the tender relates to delivery of goods, the promisee must have a reasonable opportunity of 
seeing that the thing offered is the thing which the promisor is bound by his promise to deliver; 
 
(e) tender made to one of the several joint promisees has the same effect as a tender to all of them. 
Who can demand performance? 
Generally speaking, a stranger to contract cannot sue and the person who can demand performance is the 
party to whom the promise is made. But an assignee of the rights and benefits under a contract may demand 
performance by the promisor, in the same way as the assignor, (i.e., the promisee) could have demanded. 
Effect of refusal of party to perform wholly 
Section 39 provides that when a party to a contract has refused to perform or disabled himself from 
performing his promise in its entirety, the promisee may put an end to the contract unless he had signified by 
words or conduct his acquiescence in its continuance. 
Illustration 
 
(a) X, a singer enters into a contract with Y, the manager of a theatre to sing at his theatres two nights 
in every week during the next two months, and Y engaged to pay her Rs. 100 for each nights 
performance. On the sixth night X wilfully absents herself form the theatre. Y is at liberty to put an 
end to the contract. 
 
(b) If in the above illustration, with the assent of Y, X sings on the seventh night, Y is presumed to have 
signified his acquiescence in the continuance of the contract and cannot put an end to it; but is entitled 
to compensation for the damages sustained by him through X’s failure to sing on the sixth night. 
By whom contract must be performed 
Under Section 40 of the Act, if it appears from the nature of the case that it was the intention of the parties to 
a contract that it should be performed by the promisor himself such promise must be performed by the 
promisor himself. In other cases, the promisor or his representative may employ a competent person to 
perform it. 
Illustration 
 
(a) X promises to pay Rs. 1,000 to Y. X may either personally pay the money to Y or cause it to be paid 
to Y by another. If X dies before making payment, his representatives must perform the promise or 
employ some proper person to do so. 
 
(b) X promises to paint a picture for Y. X must personally perform the promise. 
Devolution of Joint Liabilities 
Under Section 42 of the Indian Contract Act, where two or more persons have made a joint promise then, 
EP-EBCL 
506 
unless a contrary intention appears from the contract all such persons should perform the promise. If any 
one of them dies, his representatives jointly with the survivor or survivors should perform. After the death of 
the last survivor, the representatives of all jointly must fulfil the promise. 
Under Section 43 of the Indian Contract Act when two or more persons made a joint promise, the promisee 
may, in the absence of an express agreement to the contrary compel any one or more of such joint 
promisors to perform the whole of the promise. Each of two or more joint promisors may compel every other 
joint promisor to contribute equally with himself to the performance of the promise unless a contrary intention 
appears from the contract. If any one of two ore more promisors make default in such contribution, the 
remaining joint promisors should bear the loss arising from such default in equal share. 
Illustrations 
 
(a) X, Y and Z jointly promise to pay `6,000 to A. A may compel either X or Y or Z to pay the amount. 
 
(b) In the above example imagine, Z is compelled to pay the whole amount; X is insolvent but his 
assets are sufficient to pay one-half of his debts. Z is entitled to receive `1,000 from X’s estate and 
`2,500 from Y. 
 
(c) X, Y and Z make a joint promise to pay `5,000 to A, Z is unable to pay any amount and X is 
compelled to pay the whole. X is entitled to receive `2,500 from Y. 
Under Section 44 of the Act, where two or more persons have made a joint promise, a release of one of such 
joint promisors by the promisee does not discharge the other joint promisor(s); neither does it free the joint 
promisor so released from responsibility to the other joint promisor or joint promisors. 
Devolution of Joint Rights 
A promise may be made to two or more persons. The promisees are called joint promisees. For example, X 
may give a promise to repay Rs. 1,000 given by Y and Z jointly. In such case, in the absence of a contrary 
intention, the right to claim, performance rests with Y and Z. If Y dies, Y’s representative jointly with Z may, 
demand performance. If Z also dies, the representatives of Y and Z may demand jointly performance from X. 
Assignment 
The promisee may assign rights and benefits of contract and the assignee will be entitled to demand 
performance by the promisor. But the assignment to be complete and effectual, must be made by an 
instrument in writing. 
An obligation or liability under a contract cannot be assigned. For example, if A owes B Rs. 500 and A 
transfers the liability to C i.e. asks C to pay the sum to B, this would not bind B, and B may not consent to 
this arrangement, as he may know nothing of C’s solvency. But if B consents to accept performance by C, 
there is a substitution of new contract and the old contract is discharged and all rights and liabilities under it 
are extinguished. This is technically called novation. 
(b) Discharge by Mutual Agreement or Consent (Sections 62 and 63) 
A contract may be discharged by the agreement of all parties to the contract, or by waiver or release by the 
party entitled to performance. 
The methods stipulated under Sections 62 and 63 of the Indian Contract Act for discharging a contract by 
mutual consent are: 
 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
507 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Novation  when a new contract is substituted for existing contract either between the same parties or 
between different parties, the consideration mutually being the discharge of the old contract. 
Alteration  change in one or more of the material terms of a contract. 
Rescission  by agreement between the parties at any time before it is discharged by performance or in 
some other way. 
Remission  acceptance of a lesser sum than what was contracted for or a lesser fulfilment of the promise 
made. 
Waiver  deliberate abandonment or giving up of a right which a party is entitled to under a contract, where 
upon the other party to the contract is released from his obligation. 
(c) Discharge by Lapes of Time 
The Limitation Act, in certain circumstance, affords a good defence to suits for breach of contract, and infact 
terminates the contract by depriving the party of his remedy to law. For example, where a debtor has failed to 
repay the loan on the stipulated date, the creditor must file the suit against him within three years of the 
default. If the limitation period of three years expires and he takes no action he will be barred from his 
remedy and the other party is discharged of his liability to perform. 
(d) Discharge by Operation of the Law 
Discharge under this head may take place as follows: 
 
(a) By merger: When the parties embody the inferior contract in a superior contract. 
 
(b) By the unauthorised alteration of items of a written document: Where a party to a written contract 
makes any material alteration without knowledge and consent of the other, the contract can be 
avoided by the other party. 
 
(c) By insolvency: The Insolvency Act provides for discharge of contracts under particular 
circumstances. For example, where the Court passes an order discharging the insolvent, this order 
exonerates or discharges him from liabilities on all debts incurred previous to his adjudication. 
(e) Discharge by Impossibility or Frustration (Section 56) 
A contract which is entered into to perform something that is clearly impossible is void. For instance, A 
agrees with B to discover treasure by magic. The agreement is void by virtue of Section 56 para 1 which lays 
down the principle that an agreement to do an act impossible in itself is void. 
EP-EBCL 
508 
Sometimes subsequent impossibility (i.e. where the impossibility supervenes after the contract has been 
made) renders the performance of a contract unlawful and stands discharged; as for example, where a 
singer contracts to sing and becomes too ill to do so, the contract becomes void. In this connection, para 2 of 
Section 56 provides that a contract to do an act, which after the contract is made, becomes impossible or by 
reason of some event which the promisor could not prevent, unlawful, becomes void when the act becomes 
impossible or unlawful. 
If the impossibility is not obvious and the promisor alone knows of the impossibility or illegally then existing or 
the promisor might have known as such after using reasonable diligence, such promisor is bound to 
compensate the promisee for any loss he may suffer through the non-performance of the promise inspite of 
the agreement being void ab-initio (Section 56, para 3). 
In Satyabarta Ghose v. MugnuramA.I.R. 1954 S.C. 44 the Supreme Court interpreted the term ‘impossible 
appearing in second paragraph of Section 56. The Court observed that the word ‘impossible has not been used 
here in the sense of physical or literal impossibility. The performance of an act may not be literally impossible 
but it may be impracticable and useless from the point of view of the object and purpose which the parties had 
in view; and if an untoward event or change of circumstances totally upsets the very foundation upon which the 
parties rested their bargain; it can very well be said that the promisor found it impossible to do the act which he 
promised to do. In this case, A undertook to sell a plot of land to B but before the plot could be developed, war 
broke out and the land was temporarily requisitioned by the Government. A offered to return earnest money to 
B in cancellation of contract. B did not accept and sued A for specific performance. A pleaded discharge by 
frustration. The Court held that Section 56 is not applicable on the ground that the requisition was of temporary 
nature and there was no time limit within which A was obliged to perform the contract. The impossibility was not 
of such a nature which would strike at the root of the contract. 
Discharge by Supervening Impossibility 
A contract will be discharged by subsequent or supervening impossibility in any of the following ways: 
 
(a) Where the subject-matter of the contract is destroyed without the fault of the parties, the contract is 
discharged. 
 
(b) When a contract is entered into on the basis of the continued existence of a certain state of affairs, 
the contract is discharged if the state of things changes or ceases to exist. 
 
(c) Where the personal qualifications of a party is the basis of the contract, the contract is discharged 
by the death or physical disablement of that party. 
Discharge by Supervening Illegality 
A contract which is contrary to law at the time of its formation is void. But if, after the making of the contract, 
owing to alteration of the law or the act of some person armed with statutory authority the performance of the 
contract becomes impossible, the contract is discharged. This is so because the performance of the promise 
is prevented or prohibited by a subsequent change in the law. A enters into contract with B for cutting trees. 
By a statutory provision cutting of trees is prohibited except under a licence and the same is refused to A. 
The contract is discharged. 
Cases in which there is no supervening impossibility 
In the following cases contracts are not discharged on the ground of supervening impossibility 
 
(a) Difficulty of performance: The mere fact that performance is more difficult or expensive than the 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
509 
parties anticipated does not discharge the duty to perform. 
 
(b) Commercial impossibilities do not discharge the contract. A contract is not discharged merely 
because expectation of higher profits is not realised. 
 
(c) Strikes, lockouts and civil disturbance like riots do not terminate contracts unless there is a clause in 
the contract providing for non-performance in such cases. 
Supervening impossibility or illegality is known as frustration under English Law. 
(f) Discharge by Breach 
Where the promisor neither performs his contract nor does he tender performance, or where the 
performance is defective, there is a breach of contract. The breach of contract may be (i) actual; or (ii) 
anticipatory. The actual breach may take place either at the time the performance is due, or when actually 
performing the contract. Anticipatory breach means a breach before the time for the performance has 
arrived. This may also take place in two ways – by the promisor doing an act which makes the performance 
of his promise impossible or by the promisor in some other way showing his intention not to perform it. 
Anticipatory Breach of Contract 
Breach of contract may occur, before the time for performance is due. This may happen where one of the 
parties definitely renounces the contract and shows his intention not to perform it or does some act which 
makes performance impossible. The other party, on such a breach being committed, has a right of action for 
damages. 
He may either sue for breach of contract immediately after repudiation or wait till the actual date when 
performance is due and then sue for breach. If the promisee adopts the latter course, i.e., waits till the date 
when performance is due, he keeps the contract alive for the benefit of the promisor as well as for his own. 
He remains liable under it and enables the promisor not only to complete the contract in spite of previous 
repudiation, but also to avail himself of any excuse for non- performance which may have come into 
existence before the time fixed for performance. 
In Hochester v. De La Tour (1853) E.R. 922, A hired B in April to act as a courier commencing employment 
from 1st June, but wrote to B in May repudiating the agreement, B sued A for breach of contract immediately 
after repudiation. A contended that there could not be breach of contract before June 1. Held, B was 
immediately entitled to sue and need not wait till 1st June, for his right of action to accrue. 
In Avery v. Bowden (1856) 116 E.R. 1122, A hired B’s ship to carry a cargo from Russia. Later on B 
repudiated the contract. A delayed taking action hoping B would change his mind before the performance 
date. War broke out between Russia and Britain before the performance date frustating the contract. Held, A 
lost his right to sue B for damages by his delay. 
In Frost v. Knight (1872) L.R. 7 Ex. 111, the law on the subject of anticipatory breach was summed up as 
follows: 
“The promisee if he pleases may treat the notice of intention as inoperative and await the time when the 
contract is to be executed and then hold the other party responsible for all the consequences of non-
performance: but in that case he keeps the contract alive for the benefit of the other party as well as his own; 
he remains subject to all his own obligations and liabilities under it, and enables the other party not only to 
complete the contract, if so advised, notwithstanding his previous repudiation of it, but also to take advantage 
of any supervening circumstances which would justify him in declining to complete it.”

REMEDIES FOR BREACH 
Where a contract is broken, the injured party has several courses of action open to him. The appropriate 
remedy in any case will depend upon the subject-matter of the contract and the nature of the breach. 
(i) Remedies for Breach of Contract 
In case of breach of contract, the injured party may: 
 
(a) Rescind the contract and refuse further performance of the contract; 
 
(b) Sue for damages; 
 
(c) Sue for specific performance; 
 
(d) Sue for an injunction to restrain the breach of a negative term; and 
 
(e) Sue on quantum meruit 
When a party to a contract has broken the contract, the other party may treat the contract as rescinded and 
he is absolved from all his obligations under the contract. Under Section 65, when a party treats the contract 
as rescinded, he makes himself liable to restore any benefits he has received under the contract to the party 
from whom such benefits were received. Under Section 75 of the Indian Contract Act, if a person rightfully 
rescinds a contract, he is entitled to a compensation for any damage which he has sustained through the 
non-fulfilment of the contract by the other party. Section 64 deals with consequences of rescission of 
voidable contracts, i.e., where there is flaw in the consent of one party to the contract. Under this Section 
when a person at whose option a contract is voidable rescinds, the other party thereto need not perform any 
promise therein contained in which he is the promisor. The party rescinding a voidable contract shall, if he 
has received any benefit thereunder, from another party to such contract, restore such benefit so far as may 
be, to the person from whom it was received. 
(ii) Damages for Breach of Contract 
Under Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, when a contract has been broken, a party who suffers by such 
breach is entitled to receive, from the party who has broken the contract, compensation for any loss or 
damage, caused to him thereby, which naturally arose in the usual course of things from such breach or 
which the parties knew, when they made the contract to be likely to result from the breach of it. Such 
compensation is not to be given for any remote and indirect loss or damage sustained by reason of the 
breach. 
The foundation of the claim for damages rests in the celebrated case of Hadley v. Baxendale, (1854) 9 Ex. 
341. The facts of this case were as follows: 
There was a breakdown of a shaft in A’s mill. He delivered the shaft to B, a common carrier to be taken to a 
manufacturer to copy and make a new one. A did not make known to B that delay would result in loss of 
profits. By some neglect on the part of B, the delivery of the shaft was delayed in transit beyond a reasonable 
time. As a result, the mill was idle for a longer period than it would otherwise have been, had there been no 
such delay. It was held, B was not liable for the loss of profits during the period of delay as the circumstances 
communicated to A did not show that the delay in the delivery of the shaft would entail loss of profits to the 
mill. In the course of the judgement it was observed: 
“Where two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages which the other party 
ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly and reasonably be 
considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of things from such breach of contract 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
511 
itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time 
they made the contract as the probable result of the breach of it. Now, if the special circumstances under 
which the contract was actually made were communicated by the plaintiffs to the defendants and thus known 
to both the parties, the damages resulting from the breach of such a contract which they would reasonably 
contemplate, would be the amount of injury which would ordinarily follow from a breach of contract under 
these special circumstances so known and communicated. But, on other hand, if these special 
circumstances were wholly unknown to the party breaking the contract, he at the most could only be 
supposed to have had in his contemplation, the amount of injury which would arise generally and in the great 
multitude of cases not affected by any special circumstances from such breach of contract. For, had the 
special circumstances been known, the parties might have specially provided for the breach of contract by 
special terms as to damages in that case and of this advantage it would be very unjust to deprive them.” 
Liquidated and Unliquidated damages: Where the contracting parties agree in advance the amount payable 
in the event of breach, the sum payable is called liquidated damages. 
Where the amount of compensation claimed for a breach of contract is left to be assessed by the Court, 
damages claimed are called unliquidated damages. 
Unliquidated Damages 
Those are of the following kinds: 
(a) general or ordinary damages, (b) special damages (c) exemplary or punitive damages, and (d) nominal 
damages. 
Ordinary Damages 
These are restricted to pecuniary compensation to put the injured party in the position he would have been 
had the contract been performed. It is the estimated amount of loss actually incurred. Thus, it applies only to 
the proximate consequences of the breach of the contract and the remote consequences are not generally 
regarded. For example, in a contract for the sale of goods, the damages payable would be the difference 
between the contract price and the price at which the goods are available on the date of the breach. 
Special Damages 
Special damages are those resulting from a breach of contract under some peculiar circumstances. If at the 
time of entering into the contract, the party has notice of special circumstances which makes special loss the 
likely result of the breach in the ordinary course of things, then upon his-breaking the contract and the 
special loss following this breach, he will be required to make good the special loss. For example, A 
delivered goods to the Railway Administration to be carried to a place where an exhibition was being held 
and told the goods clerk that if the goods did not reach the destination on the stipulated date he would suffer 
a special loss. The goods reached late. He was entitled to claim special damages. 
Exemplary Damages 
These damages are awarded to punish the defendant and are not, as a rule, granted in case of breach of 
contract. In two cases, however, the court may award such damages, viz., 
 
(i) breach of promise to marry; and 
 
(ii) wrongful dishonour of a customerscheque by the banker. 
In a breach of promise to marry, the amount of the damages will depend upon the extent of injury to the 
partys feelings. In the bankers case, the smaller the amount of the chequedishonoured, larger will be 
EP-EBCL 
512 
damages as the credit of the customer would be injured in a far greater measure, if a cheque for a small 
amount is wrongfully dishonoured. 
Nominal Damages 
Nominal damages consist of a small token award, e.g., a rupee of even 25 paise, where there has been an 
infringement of contractual rights, but no actual loss has been suffered. These damages are awarded to 
establish the right to decree for breach of contract. 
Liquidated Damages and Penalty 
Where the contracting parties fix at the time of contract the amount of damages that would be payable in case 
of breach, in English law, the question may arise whether the term amounts to “liquidated damages” or a 
“penalty”? The Courts in England usually give effect to liquidated damages, but they always relieve against 
penalty. 
The test of the two is that where the amount fixed is a genuine pre-estimate of the loss in case of breach, it is 
liquidated damages and will be allowed. If the amount fixed is without any regard to probable loss, but is 
intended to frighten the party and to prevent him from committing breach, it is a penalty and will not be 
allowed. 
In Indian law, there is no such difference between liquidated damages and penalty. Section 74 provides for 
“reasonable compensation” upto the stipulated amount whether it is by way of liquidated damages or penalty. 
For example, A borrows Rs. 500 from B and promises to pay Rs. 1,000 if he fails to repay Rs. 500 on the 
stipulated date. On A’s failure to repay on the given date, B is entitled to recover from A such compensation, 
not exceeding Rs. 1,000 as the Court may consider reasonable. (Union of India v. Raman Iron Foundry, AIR 
1974 SC 1265). 
(iii) Specific Performance 
It means the actual carrying out by the parties of their contract, and in proper cases the Court will insist upon 
the parties carrying out this agreement. Where a party fails to perform the contract, the Court may, at its 
discretion, order the defendant to carry out his undertaking according to the terms of the contract. A decree 
for specific performance may be granted in addition to or instead of damages. 
Specific performance is usually granted in contracts connected with land, e.g., purchase of a particular plot 
or house, or to take debentures in a company. In case of sale of goods, it will only be granted if the goods 
are unique and cannot be purchased in the market, e.g., a particular race horse, or one of special value to 
the party suing by reason of personal or family association, e.g., an heirloom. 
Specific performance will not be ordered: 
 
(a) where monetary compensation is an adequate remedy; 
 
(b) where the Court cannot supervise the execution of the contract, e.g., a building contract; 
 
(c) where the contract is for personal service; and 
 
(d) where one of the parties is a minor. 
(iv) Injunction 
An injunction, is an order of a Court restraining a person from doing a particular act. It is a mode of securing 
the specific performance of a negative term of the contract, (i.e., where he is doing something which he 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
513 
promises not to do), the Court may in its discretion issue an order to the defendant restraining him from 
doing what he promised not to do. Injunction may be prohibitory or mandatory. In prohibitory, the Court 
restrains the commission of a wrongful act whereas in mandatory, it restrains continuance of a wrongful 
commission. 
In Lumley v. Wagner (1852) 90 R.R. 125. W agreed to sing at L’s theatre and nowhere else. W, in breach of 
contract with L entered into a contract to sing for Z. Held, although W could not be compelled to sing at L’s 
theatre, yet she could be restrained by injunction from singing for Z. 
CONTRACT OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE (Sections 124 to 147) 
 
Meaning of Indemnity 
A contract of indemnity is a contract by which one party promises to save the other party from loss caused to 
him by the conduct of the promisor himself, or by the conduct of any other person (Section 124). For 
example, A contracts to indemnify B against the consequence of any proceedings which C may take against 
B in respect of a certain sum of 300 rupees. This is a contract of indemnity. The contract of indemnity may be 
express or implied. The later may be inferred from the circumstances of a particular case, e.g., an act done 
by A at the request of B. If A incurs any expenses, he can recover the same from B. 
The person who promises to indemnify or make good the loss is called the indemnifier and the person whose 
loss is made good is called the indemnified or the indemnity holder. A contract of insurance is an example of 
a contract of indemnity according to English Law. In consideration of premium, the insurer promises to make 
good the loss suffered by the assured on account of the destruction by fire of his property insured against 
fire. 
Under the Indian Contract Act, the contract of indemnity is restricted to such cases only where the loss 
promised to be reimbursed, is caused by the conduct of the promisor or of any other person. The loss 
caused by events or accidents which do not depend on the conduct of any person, it seems, cannot be 
sought to be reimbursed under a contract of indemnity. 
Rights of Indemnity Holder when Sued 
Under Section 125, the promisee in a contract of indemnity, acting within the scope of his authority, is 
entitled to recover from the promisor— 
 
(1) all damages which he may be compelled to pay in any suit in respect of any matter to which the 
promise to indemnify applies; 
 
(2) all costs which he may be compelled to pay in any such suit if, in bringing or defending it, he did not 
contravene the orders of the promisor, and acted as if it would have been prudent for him to act in 
the absence of any contract of indemnity, or if the promisor authorised him to bring or defend the 
suit; and 
 
(3) all sums which he may have paid under the terms of any compromise of any such suit, if the 
compromise was not contrary to the orders of the promisor, and was one which it would have been 
prudent for the promisee to make in the absence of any contract of indemnity, or if the promisor 
authorised him to compromise the suit. 
Meaning of Contract of Guarantee 
A contract of guarantee is a contract to perform the promise, or discharge the liability of a third person in 
EP-EBCL 
514 
case of his default. The person who gives the guarantee is called the Surety, the person for whom the 
guarantee is given is called the Principal Debtor, and the person to whom the guarantee is given is called the 
Creditor (Section 126). A guarantee may be either oral or written, although in the English law, it must be in 
writing.  
Illustration 
A advances a loan of Rs. 5,000 to B and C promises to A that if B does not repay the loan, C will do so. This 
is a contract of guarantee. Here B is the principal debtor, A is the creditor and C is the surety or guarantor. 
Like a contract of indemnity, a guarantee must also satisfy all the essential elements of a valid contract. 
There is, however, a special feature with regard to consideration in a contract of guarantee. The 
consideration received by the principal debtor is sufficient for surety. Section 127 provides that anything done 
or any promise made for the benefit of the principal debtor may be a sufficient consideration to the surety for 
giving the guarantee. 
Illustration 
 
(i) B requests A to sell and deliver to him goods on credit. A agrees to do so, provided C will guarantee 
the payment of the price of the goods. C promises to guarantee the payment in consideration of A’s 
promise to deliver the goods. This is sufficient consideration for C’s promise. 
 
(ii) A sells and delivers goods to B.  C afterwards requests A to forbear to sue B for the debt for a year, 
and promises that if he does so, C will pay for them in default of payment by B.  A agrees to forbear 
as requested. This is sufficient consideration for C’s promise. 
Distinction between Indemnity and Guarantee 
A contract of indemnity differs from a contract of guarantee in the following ways: 
 
(a) In a contract of indemnity there are only two parties: the indemnifier and the indemnified. In a 
contract of guarantee, there are three parties; the surety, the principal debtor and the creditor. 
 
(b) In a contract of indemnity, the liability of the indemnifier is primary. In a contract of guarantee, the 
liability of the surety is secondary. The surety is liable only if the principal debtor makes a default, 
the primary liability being that of the principal debtor. 
 
(c) The indemnifier need not necessarily act at the request of the debtor; the surety gives guarantee 
only at the request of the principal debtor. 
 
(d) In the case of a guarantee, there is an existing debt or duty, the performance of which is guaranteed 
by the surety, whereas in the case of indemnity, the possibility of any loss happening is the only 
contingency against which the indemnifier undertakes to indemnify. 
 
(e) The surety, on payment of the debt when the principal debtor has failed to pay is entitled to proceed 
against the principal debtor in his own right, but the indemnifier cannot sue third-parties in his own 
name, unless there be assignment. He must sue in the name of the indemnified. 
Extent of Surety’s Liability 
The liability of the surety is co-extensive with that of the principal debtor unless the contract otherwise 
provides (Section 128). A creditor is not bound to proceed against the principal debtor. He can sue the surety 
without sueing the principal debtor. As soon as the debtor has made default in payment of the debt, the 
surety is immediately liable. But until default, the creditor cannot call upon the surety to pay. In this sense, 
the nature of the surety’s liability is secondary. 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
515 
Illustration 
A guarantees to B the payment of a bill of exchange by C, the acceptor. The bill is dishonoured by C. A is liable 
not only for the amount of the bill but also for any interest and charges which may have become due on it. 
Section 128 only explains the quantum of a surety’s obligation when terms of the contract do not limit it. 
Conversely it doesn’t follow that the surety can never be liable when the principal debtor cannot be held 
liable. Thus, a surety is not discharged from liability by the mere fact that the contract between the principal 
debtor and creditor was voidable at the option of the former, and was avoided by the former. Where the 
agreement between the principal debtor and creditor is void as for example in the case of minority of 
principal debtor, the surety is liable as a principal debtor; for in such cases the contract of the so-called 
surety is not collateral, but a principal contract (Kashiba  v.Shripat (1894) 19 Bom. 697). 
Kinds of Guarantees 
A contract of guarantee may be for an existing debt, or for a future debt. It may be a specific guarantee, or it 
may be a continuing guarantee. A specific guarantee is given for a single debt and comes to an end when 
the debt guaranteed has been paid. 
A continuing guarantee is one which extends to a series of transactions (Section 129). The liability of surety 
in case of a continuing guarantee extends to all the transactions contemplated until the revocation of the 
guarantee. As for instance, S, in consideration that C will employ P in collecting the rents of C’s Zamindari, 
promises C to be responsible to the amount of Rs. 5,000 for the due collection and payment by P of these 
rents. This is a continuing guarantee. 
Revocation of Continuing Guarantee 
A continuing guarantee is revoked in the following circumstances: 
 
(a) By notice of revocation by the surety (Section 130): The notice operates to revoke the surety’s 
liability as regards future transactions. He continues to be liable for transactions entered into prior to 
the notice (Offord  v. Davies (1862) 6 L.T.S. 79). 
 
(b) By the death of the surety: The death of the surety operates, in the absence of contract (Lloyds v. 
Harper (188) 16 Ch. D. 290) as a revocation of a continuing guarantee, so far as regards future 
transactions (Section 131). But for all the transactions made before his death, the surety’s estate will 
be liable. 
Rights of Surety 
A surety has certain rights against the creditor, (Section 141) the principal debtor (Sections 140 and 145) and 
the co-securities (Sections 146 and 147). Those are— 
 
(a) Surety’s rights against the creditor: Under Section 141 a surety is entitled to the benefit of every 
security which the creditor has against the principal debtor at the time when the contract of 
suretyship is entered into whether the surety knows of the existence of such security or not; and, if 
the creditor losses or, without the consent of the surety parts with such security, the surety is 
discharged to the extent of the value of the security. 
 
(b) Rights against the principal debtor: After discharging the debt, the surety steps into the shoes of the 
creditor or is subrogated to all the rights of the creditor against the principal debtor. He can then sue 
the principal debtor for the amount paid by him to the creditor on the debtors default; he becomes a 
creditor of the principal debtor for what he has paid. 
EP-EBCL 
516 
 
 In some circumstances, the surety may get certain rights even before payment. The surety has 
remedies against the principal debtor before payment and after payment. In Mamta Ghose  v. 
United Industrial Bank (AIR 1987 Cal. 180) where the principal debtor, after finding that the debt 
became due, started disposing of his properties to prevent seizure by surety, the Court granted an 
injunction to the surety restraining the principal debtor from doing so. The surety can compel the 
debtor, after debt has become due to exonerate him from his liability by paying the debt. 
 
(c) Surety’s rights gains co-sureties: When a surety has paid more than his share of debt to the creditor, 
he has a right of contribution from the co-securities who are equally bound to pay with him. A, B and C 
are sureties to D for the sum of Rs. 3,000 lent to E who makes default in payment. A, B and C are 
liable, as between themselves to pay Rs. 1,000 each. If any one of them has to pay more than Rs. 
1,000 he can claim contribution from the other two to reduce his payment to only Rs. 1,000. If one of 
them becomes insolvent, the other two shall have to contribute the unpaid amount equally.  
Discharge of Surety 
A surety may be discharged from liability under the following circumstances: 
 
(a) By notice of revocation in case of a continuing guarantee as regards future transaction (Section 
130.) 
 
(b) By the death of the surety as regards future transactions, in a continuing guarantee in the absence 
of a contract to the contrary (Section 131). 
 
(c) Any variation in the terms of the contract between the creditor and the principal debtor, without the 
consent of the surety, discharges the surety as regards all transactions taking place after the 
variation (Section 133). 
 
(d) A surety will be discharged if the creditor releases the principal debtor, or acts or makes an 
omission which results in the discharge of the principal debtor (Section 134). But where the creditor 
fails to sue the principal debtor within the limitation period, the surety is not discharged. 
 
(e) Where the creditor, without the consent of the surety, makes an arrangement with the principal 
debtor for composition, or promises to give time or not to sue him, the surety will be discharged 
(Section 135). 
 
(f) If the creditor does any act which is against the rights of the surety, or omits to do an act which his 
duty to the surety requires him to do, and the eventual remedy of the surety himself against the 
principal debtor is thereby impaired, the surety is discharged (Section 139). 
 
(g) If the creditor loses or parts with any security which at the time of the contract the debtor had given 
in favour of the creditor, the surety is discharged to the extent of the value of the security, unless the 
surety consented to the release of such security by creditor in favour of the debtor. It is immaterial 
whether the surety was or is aware of such security or not (Section 141). 
CONTRACT OF BAILMENT AND PLEDGE 
 
(a) Bailment 
A bailment is a transaction whereby one person delivers goods to another person for some purpose, upon a 
contract that they are, when the purpose is accomplished to be returned or otherwise disposed of according 
to the directions of the person delivering them (Section 148). The person who delivers the goods is called the 
bailor and the person to whom they are delivered is called the bailee. 
Bailment is a voluntary delivery of goods for a temporary purpose on the understanding that they are to be 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
517 
returned in specie in the same or altered form. The ownership of the goods remains with the bailor, the bailee 
getting only the possession. Delivery of goods may be actual or constructive, e.g., where the key of a godown is 
handed over to another person, it amounts to delivery of goods in the godown. 
Gratuitous Bailment 
A gratuitous bailment is one in which neither the bailor nor the bailee is entitled to any remuneration. Such a 
bailment may be for the exclusive benefit of the bailor, e.g., when A leaves his dog with a neighbour to be 
looked after in A’s absence on a holiday. It may again be for exclusive benefit of the bailee, e.g., where you 
lend your book to a friend of yours for a week. In neither case any charge is made. 
A gratuitous bailment terminates by the death of either the bailor or the bailee (Section 162). 
Under Section 159 the lender of a thing for use may at any time require its return if the loan was gratuitous, 
even though he lent it for a specified time or purpose. But if on the faith of such loan made for a specified 
time or purpose, the borrower has acted in such a manner that the return of the thing lent before the time 
agreed upon would cause him loss exceeding the benefit actually derived by him from the loan, the lender 
must, if he compels the return, indemnify the borrower the amount in which the loss so occasioned exceeds 
the benefit so derived. 
Bailment for Reward 
This is for the mutual benefit of both the bailor and the bailee. For example, A lets out a motor-car for hire to 
B. A is the bailor and receives the hire charges and B is the bailee and gets the use of the car. Where, A 
hands over his goods to B, a carrier for carriage at a price, A is the bailor who enjoys the benefit of carriage 
and B is the bailee who receives a remuneration for carrying the goods. 
Duties of Bailee 
The bailee owes the following duties in respect of the goods bailed to him: 
 
(a) The bailee must take as much care of the goods bailed to him as a man of ordinary prudence would 
take under similar circumstances of his own goods of the same bulk, quality and value as the goods 
bailed (Section 151). If he takes this much care he will not be liable for any loss, destruction or 
deterioration of the goods bailed (Section 152). The degree of care required from the bailee is the 
same whether the bailment is for reward or gratuitous. 
 
 Of course, the bailee may agree to take special care of the goods, e.g., he may agree to keep the 
property safe from all perils and answers for accidents or thefts. But even such a bailee will not be 
liable for loss happening by an act of God or by public enemies. 
 
(b) The bailee is under a duty not to use the goods in an unauthorised manner or for unauthorised 
purpose (Section 153). If he does so, the bailor can terminate the bailment and claim damages for 
any loss or damage caused by the unauthorised used (Section 154). 
 
(c) He must keep the goods bailed to him separate from his own goods (Sections 155-157). 
 
 If the bailee without the consent of the bailor, mixes the goods of the bailor with his own goods, the 
bailor and the bailee shall have an interest, in production to their respective shares, in the mixture 
thus produced. If the bailee without the consent of the bailor, mixes the goods of the bailor with his 
own goods, and the goods can be separated or divided, the property in the goods remains in the 
parties respectively; but the bailee is bound to bear the expenses of separation, and any damages 
arising from the mixture. 
EP-EBCL 
518 
 
 If the bailee without the consent of the bailor mixes, the goods of the bailor with his own goods, in 
such a manner that it is impossible to separate the goods bailed from the other goods and deliver 
them back, the bailor is entitled to be compensated by the bailee for the loss of goods. 
 
(d) He must not set up an adverse title to the goods. 
 
(e) It is the duty of the bailee to return the goods without demand on the expiry of the time fixed or 
when the purpose is accomplished (Section 160). If he fails to return them, he shall be liable for any 
loss, destruction or deterioration of the goods even without negligence on his part (Section 161). 
 
(f) In the absence of any contract to the contrary, the baliee must return to the bailor any increase, or 
profits which may have accrued from the goods bailed; for example, when A leaves a cow in the 
custody of B to be taken care of and the cow gets a calf, B is bound is deliver the cow as well as the 
calf to A (Section 163). 
Bailees Particular Lien (Section 170) 
Where the goods are bailed for a particular purpose and the bailee in due performance of bailment, expands 
his skill and labour, he has in the absence of an agreement to the contrary a lien on the goods, i.e., the bailee 
can retain the goods until his charges in respect of labour and skill used on the goods are paid by the bailor. A 
gives a piece of cloth to B, a tailor, for making it into a suit, B promises to have the suit ready for delivery within 
a fortnight, B has the suit ready for delivery. He has a right to retain the suit until he is paid his dues. The 
section expresses the Common Law principle that if a man has an article delivered to him on the improvement 
of which he has to bestow trouble and expenses, he has a right to detain it until his demand is paid. 
The right of lien arises only where labour and skill have been used so as to confer an additional value on the 
article. 
Particular and General Lien 
Lien is of two kinds: Particular lien and General lien. A particular lien is one which is available only against 
that property of which the skill and labour have been exercised. A bailee’s lien is a particular lien. 
A general lien is a right to detain any property belonging to the other and in the possession of the person 
trying to exercise the lien in respect of any payment lawfully due to him. 
Thus, a general lien is the right to retain the property of another for a general balance of accounts but a 
particular lien is a right to retain only for a charge on account of labour employed or expenses bestowed 
upon the identical property detained. 
The right of general lien is expressly given by Section 171 of the Indian Contract Act to bankers, factors, 
warfingers, attorneys of High Court and policy-brokers, provided there is no agreement to the contrary. 
Duties of bailor 
The bailor has the following duties: 
 
(a) The bailor must disclose all the known faults in the goods; and if he fails to do that, he will be liable 
for any damage resulting directly from the faults (Section 150). For example, A delivers to B, a 
carrier, some explosive in a case, but does not warn B. The case is handled without extraordinary 
care necessary for such articles and explodes. A is liable for all the resulting damage to men and 
other goods. 
 
 In the case of bailment for hire, a still greater responsibility is placed on the bailor. He will be liable 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
519 
even if he did not know of the defects (Section 150). A hires a carriage of B. The carriage is unsafe 
though B does not know this. A is injured. B is responsible to A for the injury. 
 
(b) It is the duty of the bailor to pay any extraordinary expenses incurred by the bailee. For example, if 
a horse is lent for a journey, the expense of feeding the house would, of course, subject to any 
special agreement be borne by the bailee. If however the horse becomes ill and expenses have 
been incurred on its treatment, the bailor shall have to pay these expenses (Section 158). 
 
(c) The bailor is bound to indemnify the bailee for any cost or costs which the bailee may incur because 
of the defective title of the bailor of the goods bailed (Section 164). 
Termination of bailment 
Where the bailee wrongfully uses or dispose of the goods bailed, the bailor may determine the bailment 
(Section 153.) 
As soon as the period of bailment expires or the object of the bailment has been achieved, the bailment 
comes to an end, and the bailee must return the goods to the bailor (Section 160). Bailment is terminated 
when the subject matter of bailment is destroyed or by reason of change in its nature, becomes incapable of 
use for the purpose of bailment. 
A gratuitous bailment can be terminated by the bailor at any time, even before the agreed time, subject to the 
limitation that where termination before the agreed period causes loss in excess of benefit, the bailor must 
compensate the bailee (Section 159). 
A gratuitous bailment terminates by the death of either the bailor or the bailee (Section 162). 
Finder of Lost Goods 
The position of a finder of lost goods is exactly that of a bailee. The rights of a finder are that he can sue the 
owner for any reward that might have been offered, and may retain the goods until he receives the reward. 
But where the owner has offered no reward, the finder has only a particular lien and can detain the goods 
until he receives compensation for the troubles and expenses incurred in preserving the property for finding 
out the true owner. But he cannot file a suit for the recovery of the compensation [Section 168]. 
Thus, as against the true owner, the finder of goods in a public or quasi public place is only a bailee; he keeps 
the article in trust for the real owner. As against every-one else, the property in the goods vests in the finder on 
his taking possession of it. 
The finder has a right to sell the property— 
 
(a) where the owner cannot with reasonable diligence be found, or 
 
(b) when found, he refuses to pay the lawful charges of the finder and— 
 
(i) if the thing is in danger of perishing or losing greater part of its value, or 
 
(ii) when the lawful charges of the finder for the preservation of goods and the finding out of the 
owner amounts to two-thirds of the value of the thing (Section 169). 
Carrier as Bailee 
A common carrier undertakes to carry goods of all persons who are willing to pay his usual or reasonable 
rates. He further undertakes to carry them safely, and make good all loses, unless they are caused by act of 
EP-EBCL 
520 
God or public enemies. Carriers by land including railways and carriers by inland navigation, are common 
carriers. Carriers by Sea for hire are not common carriers and they can limit their liability. Railways in India 
are now common carriers. 
Inn-keepers: The liability of a hotel keeper is governed by Sections 151 and 152 of the Contract Act and is 
that of an ordinary bailee with regard to the property of the guests. 
C stayed in a room in a hotel. The hotel-keeper knew that the room was in an insecure condition. While C 
was dining in the dining room, some articles were stolen from his room. It was held that the hotel-keeper was 
liable as he should have taken reasonable steps to rectify the insecured condition of the rooms (Jan & San v. 
Caneron (1922) 44 All. 735). 
(b) Pledge 
Pledge or pawn is a contract whereby an article is deposited with a lender of money or promisee as security 
for the repayment of a loan or performance of a promise. The bailor or depositor is called the Pawnor and the 
bailee or depositee the “Pawnee” (Section 172). Since pledge is a branch of bailment, the pawness is bound 
to take reasonable care of the goods pledged with him. Any kind of goods, valuables, documents or 
securities may be pledged. The Government securities, e.g., promissory notes must, however, be pledged by 
endorsement and delivery. 
The following are the essential ingredients of a pledge: 
 
(i) The property pledged should be delivered to the pawnee. 
 
(ii) Delivery should be in pursuance of a contract. 
 
(iii) Delivery should be for the purpose of security. 
 
(iv) Delivery should be upon a condition to return. 
Rights of the Pawnee 
No property in goods pawned passes to the pawnee, but the pawnee gets a “special property to retain 
possession even against the true owner until the payment of the debt, interest on the debt, and any other 
expense incurred in respect of the possession or for preservation of the goods pledged” (Section 173). The 
pawnee must return the goods to the pawnor on the tender of all that is due to him. The pawnee cannot 
confer a good title upon a bona fide purchaser for value. 
Should the pawnor make a default in payment of the debt or performance of the promise at the stipulated 
time, the pawnee may- 
 
(i) file a suit for the recovery of the amount due to him while retaining the goods pledged as collateral 
security; or 
 
(ii) sue for the sale of the goods and the realisation of money due to him; or 
 
(iii) himself sell the goods pawned, after giving reasonable notice to the pawnor, sue for the deficiency, 
if any, after the sale. 
If the sale is made in execution of a decree, the pawnee may buy the goods at the sale. But he cannot sell 
them to himself in a sale made by himself under (iii) above. If after sale of the goods, there is surplus, the 
pawnee must pay it to the pawnor (Section 176). 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
521 
Rights of Pawnor 
On default by pawnor to repay on the stipulated date, the pawnee may sell the goods after giving reasonable 
notice to the pawnor. If the pawnee makes an unauthorised sale without giving notice to the pawnor, the pawnor 
has the following rights— 
 
(i) He can file a suit for redemption of goods by depositing the money treating the sale as if it had 
never taken place; or 
 
(ii) He can ask for damages on the ground of conversion. 
Pledge by Non-owners 
Ordinarily, the owner of the goods would pledge them to secure a loan but the law permits under certain 
circumstances a pledge by a person who is not the owner but is in possession of the goods. Thus, a valid 
pledge may be created by the following non-owners. 
 
(a) A mercantile agent: Where a mercantile agent is, with the consent of the owner, in possession of 
goods or the documents of title to goods, any pledge made by him, when acting in the ordinary 
course of business of a mercantile agent, is as valid as if he were expressly authorised by the 
owner of the goods to make the same. But the pledge is valid only if the pawnee acts in good faith 
and has not at the time of the pledge notice that the pawnor has not the authority to pledge (Section 
178). 
 
(b) Pledge by seller or buyer in possession after sale: A seller, left in possession of goods sold, is no 
more the owner, but pledge by him will be valid, provided the pawnee acted in good faith and had 
no notice of the sale of goods to the buyer (Section 30 of The Sale of Goods Act 1930). 
 
(c) Pledge where pawnor having limited interest: When the pawnor is not the owner of the goods but 
has a limited interest in the goods which he pawns, e.g., he is a mortgagee or he has a lien with 
respect of these goods, the pledge will be valid to the extent of such interest. 
 
(d) Pledge by co-owner in possession: One of the several co-owners of goods in possession thereof 
with the assent of the other co-owners may create a valid pledge of the goods. 
 
(e) Pledge by person in possession under a voidable contract: A person may obtain possession under 
a contract which is voidable at the option of the lawful owner on the ground of misrepresentation, 
fraud, etc. The person in possession may pledge the goods before the contract is avoided by the 
other party (Section 178A). 
LAW OF AGENCY 
Definition of Agent (Section 182) 
An agent is a person who is employed to bring his principal into contractual relations with third-parties. As the 
definition indicates, an agent is a mere connecting link between the principal and a third-party. But during the 
period that an agent is acting for his principal, he is clothed with the capacity of his principal. 
Creation of Agency 
A contract of agency may be express or implied, (Section 186) but consideration is not an essential element 
in this contract (Section 185). Agency may also arise by estoppel, necessity or ratification. 
 
(a) Express Agency: A contract of agency may be made orally or in writing. The usual form of written 
contract of agency is the Power of Attorney, which gives him the authority to act on behalf of his 
EP-EBCL 
522 
principal in accordance with the terms and conditions therein. In an agency created to transfer 
immovable property, the power of attorney must be registered. A power of attorney may be general, 
giving several powers to the agent, or special, giving authority to the agent for transacting a single 
act. 
 
(b) Implied Agency: Implied agency may arise by conduct, situation of parties or necessity of the case. 
 
(i) Agency by Estoppel (Section 237): Estoppel arises when you are precluded from denying the 
truth of anything which you have represented as a fact, although it is not a fact. Thus, where P 
allows third-parties to believe that A is acting as his authorised agent, he will be estopped from 
denying the agency if such third-parties relying on it make a contract with A even when A had 
no authority at all. 
 
(ii) Wife as agent: Where a husband and wife are living together, the wife is presumed to have her 
husbands authority to pledge his credit for the purchase of necessaries of life suitable to their 
standard of living. But the husband will not be liable if he shows that (i) he had expressly 
warned the trademan not to supply goods on credit to his wife; or (ii) he had expressly forbidden 
the wife to pledge his credit; or (iii) his wife was already sufficiently supplied with the articles in 
question; or (iv) she was supplied with a sufficient allowance. 
 
 Similarly, where any person is held out by another as his agent, the third-party can hold that 
person liable for the acts of the ostensible agent, or the agent by holding out. Partners are each 
others agents for making contracts in the ordinary course of the partnership business. 
 
(iii) Agency of Necessity (Sections 188 and 189): In certain circumstances, a person who has been 
entrusted with anothers property, may have to incur unauthorised expenses to protect or preserve it. 
Such an agency is called an agency of necessity. For example, A sent a horse by railway and on its 
arrival at the destination there was no one to receive it. The railway company, being bound to take 
reasonable steps to keep the horse alive, was an agent of necessity of A. 
 
 A wife deserted by her husband and thus forced to live separate from him, can pledge her husbands 
credit to buy all necessaries of life according to the position of the husband even against his wishes. 
 
(iv) Agency by ratification (Sections 169-200): Where a person having no authority purports to act as 
agent, or a duly appointed agent exceeds his authority, the principal is not bound by the contract 
supposedly based on his behalf. But the principal may ratify the agents transaction and so accept 
liability. In this way an agency by ratification arises. This is also known as ex post facto agency—
agency arising after the event. The effect of ratification is to render the contract binding on the 
principal as if the agent had been authorisedbefore hand. Also ratification relates back to the 
original making of the contract so that the agency is taken to have come into existence from the 
moment the agent first acted, and not from the date the principal ratified it. Ratification is effective 
only if the following conditions are satisfied 
 
(a) The agent must expressly contract as agent for a principal who is in existence and competent to 
contract. 
 
(b) The principal must be competent to contract not only at the time the agent acted, but also when 
he ratified the agents act. 
 
(c) The principal at the time of ratification has full knowledge of the material facts, and must ratify 
the whole contract, within a reasonable time. 
 
(d) Ratification cannot be made so as to subject a third-party to damages, or terminate any right or 
interest of a third person. 
 
(e) Only lawful acts can be ratified. 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
523 
Classes of Agents 
Agents may be special or general or, they may be mercantile agents: 
 
(a) Special Agent: A special agent is one who is appointed to do a specified act, or to perform a 
specified function. He has no authority outside this special task. The third-party has no right to 
assume that the agent has unlimited authority. Any act of the agent beyond that authority will not 
bind the principal. 
 
(b) General Agent: A general agent is appointed to do anything within the authority given to him by the 
principal in all transactions, or in all transactions relating to a specified trade or matter. The third-
party may assume that such an agent has power to do all that is usual for a general agent to do in 
the business involved. The third party is not affected by any private restrictions on the agents 
authority. 
Sub-Agent 
A person who is appointed by the agent and to whom the principal’s work is delegated to known as sub-
agent. Section 191 provides that “a sub-agent is a person employed by, and acting under the control of the 
original agent in the business of the agency.” So, the sub-agent is the agent of the original agent. 
As between themselves, the relation of sub-agent and original agent is that of agent and the principal. A sub-
agent is bound by all the duties of the original agent. The sub-agent is not directly responsible to the principal 
except for fraud and wilful wrong. The sub-agent is responsible to the original agent. The original agent is 
responsible to the principal for the acts of the sub-agent. As regards third persons, the principal is 
represented by sub-agent and he is bound and responsible for all the acts of sub-agent as if he were an 
agent originally appointed by the principal. 
Mercantile Agents 
Section 2(9) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, defines a mercantile agent as “a mercantile agent having in the 
customary course of business as such agent authority either to sell goods or consign goods for the purposes 
of sale, or to buy goods, or to raise money on the security of goods”. This definition covers factors, brokers, 
auctioneers, commission agents etc. 
Factors 
A factor is a mercantile agent employed to sell goods which have been placed in his possession or contract 
to buy goods for his principal. He is the apparent owner of the goods in his custody and can sell them in his 
own name and receive payment for the goods. He has an insurable interest in the goods and also a general 
lien in respect of any claim he may have arising out of the agency. 
Brokers 
A broker is a mercantile agent whose ordinary course of business is to make contracts with other parties for 
the sale and purchase of goods and securities of which he is not entrusted with the possession for a 
commission called brokerage. He acts in the name of principal. He has no lien over the goods as he is not in 
possession of them. 
Del CredereAgent 
A del credere agent is a mercantile agent, who is in consideration of an extra remuneration guarantees to his 
principal that the purchasers who buy on credit will pay for the goods they take. In the event of a third-party 
failing to pay, the del credere agent is bound to pay his principal the sum owned by third-party. 
EP-EBCL 
524 
Auctioneers 
An auctioneer is an agent who sells goods by auction, i.e., to the highest bidder in public competition. He has 
no authority to warrant his principals title to the goods. He is an agent for the seller but after the goods have 
been knocked down he is agent for the buyer also for the purpose of evidence that the sale has taken place. 
Partners 
In a partnership firm, every partner is an agent of the firm and of his co-partners for the purpose of the 
business of the firm. 
Bankers 
The relationship between a banker and his customer is primarily that of debtor and creditor. In addition, a 
banker is an agent of his customer when he buys or sells securities, collects cheques dividends, bills or 
promissory notes on behalf of his customer. He has a general lien on all securities and goods in his 
possession in respect of the general balance due to him by the customer. 
Duties of the Agent 
An agent’s duties towards his principal are as follows (which give corresponding rights to the principal who 
may sue for damages in the event of a breach of duty by the agent): 
 
(a) An agent must act within the scope of the authority conferred upon him and carry out strictly the 
instructions of the principal (Section 211). 
 
(b) in the absence of express instructions, he must follow the custom prevailing in the same kind of 
business at the place where the agent conducts the business (Section 211). 
 
(c) He must do the work with reasonable skill and diligence whereby the nature of his profession, the 
agent purports to have special skill, he must exercise the skill which is expected from the members 
of the profession (Section 212). 
 
(d) He must disclose promptly any material information coming to his knowledge which is likely to 
influence the principal in the making of the contract. 
 
(e) He must not disclose confidential information entrusted to him by his principal (Section 213). 
 
(f) He must not allow his interest to conflict with his duty, e.g., he must not compete with his principal 
(Section 215). 
 
(g) The agent must keep true accounts and must be prepared on reasonable notice to render an 
account. 
 
(h) He must not make any secret profit; he must disclose any extra profit that he may make. 
 
 Where an agent is discovered taking secret bribe, etc., the principal is entitled to (i) dismiss the 
agent without notice, (ii) recover the amount of secret profit, and (iii) refuse to pay the agent his 
remuneration. He may repudiate the contract, if the third-party is involved in secret profit and also 
recover damages. 
 
(i) An agent must not delegate his authority to sub-agent. A sub-agent is a person employed by and 
acting under the control of the original agent in the business of agency (Section 191). This rule is 
based on the principle: Delegatus non-potest delegare — a delegate cannot further delegate 
(Section 190). 
 
 But there are exceptions to this rule and the agent may delegate (i) where delegation is allowed by 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
525 
the principal, (ii) where the trade custom or usage sanctions delegation, (iii) where delegation is 
essential for proper performance, (iv) where an emergency renders it imperative, (v) where nature 
of the work is purely ministerial, and (vi) where the principal knows that the agent intends to 
delegate. 
Rights of Agents 
Where the services rendered by the agent are not gratuitous or voluntary, the agent is entitled to receive the 
agreed remuneration, or if none was agreed, a reasonable remuneration. The agent becomes entitled to 
receive remuneration as soon as he has done what he had undertaken to do (Section 219). 
Certain classes of agents, e.g., factors who have goods and property of their principal in their possession, 
have a lien on the goods or property in respect of their remuneration and expense and liabilities incurred. He 
has a right to stop the goods in transit where he is an unpaid seller. 
As the agent represents the principal, the agent has a right to be indemnified by the principal against all 
charges, expenses and liabilities properly incurred by him in the course of the agency (Sections 222-223). 
Extent of Agent’s Authority 
The extent of the authority of an agent depends upon the terms expressed in his appointment or it may be 
implied by the circumstances of the case. The contractual authority is the real authority, but implied authority 
is to do whatevers incidental to carry out the real authority. This implied authority is also known as apparent 
or ostensible authority, Thus, an agent having an authority to do an act has authority to do everything lawful 
which is necessary for the purpose or usually done in the course of conducting business. 
An agent has authority to do all such things which may be necessary to protect the principal from loss in an 
emergency and which he would do to protect his own property under similar circumstances. Where butter 
was becoming useless owing to delay in transit and was therefore sold by the station master for the best 
price available as it was not possible to obtain instructions from the principal, the sale was held binding upon 
the principal. 
Responsibilities of Principal to Third-parties 
The effect of a contract made by an agent varies according to the circumstances under which the agent 
contracted. There are three circumstances in which an agent may contract, namely— 
 
(i) the agent acts for a named principal; 
 
(ii) the agent acts for an undisclosed principal; and 
 
(iii) the agent acts for a concealed principal. 
(a) Disclosed principal: Where the agent contracts as agent for a named principal, he generally incurs neither 
rights nor liabilities under the contract, and drops out as soon as it is made. The contract is made between 
the principal and the third-party and it is between these two that rights and obligations are created. The legal 
effect is the same as if the principal had contracted directly with the third-party. 
The effect is that the principal is bound by all acts of the agent done within the scope of actual, apparent or 
ostensible authority. This ostensible authority of the agent is important, for the acts of a general agent are 
binding on the principal if they are within the scope of his apparent authority, although they may be outside 
the scope of his actual authority. Therefore, a private or secret limitation or restriction of powers of an agent 
do not bind innocent third-party. 
EP-EBCL 
526 
(b) Undisclosed principal: Where the agent disclose that he is merely an agent but conceals the identity of 
his principal, he is not personally liable, as he drops out in normal way. The principal, on being discovered, 
will be responsible for the contract made by the agent. 
(c) Concealed principal: Where an agent appears to be contracting on his own behalf, without either 
contracting as an agent or disclosing the existence of an agency (i.e., he discloses neither the name of the 
principal nor his existence), he becomes personally liable. The third-party may sue either the principal (when 
discovered) or the agent or both. If the third-party chooses to sue the principal and not the agent, he must 
allow the principal the benefit of all payments made by him to the agent on account of the contract before the 
agency was disclosed. The third-party is also entitled to get the benefit of anything he may have paid to the 
agent. 
If the principal discloses himself before the contract is completed, the other contracting party may refuse to 
fulfil the contract if he can show that, if he had known who was the principal in the contract, or if he had 
known that the agent was not the principal, he would not have entered into the contract. 
Principal Liable for Agent’s Torts (Section 238) 
If an agent commits a tort or other wrong (e.g., misrepresentation or fraud) during his agency, whilst acting 
within the scope of his actual or apparent authority, the principal is liable. But the agent is also personally 
liable, and he may be sued also. The principal is liable even if the tort is committed exclusively for the benefit 
of the agent and against the interests of the principal. 
Personal Liability of Agent to Third-party 
An agent is personally liable in the following cases: 
 
(a) Where the agent has agreed to be personally liable to the third-party. 
 
(b) Where an agent acts for a principal residing abroad. 
 
(c) When the agent signs a negotiable instrument in his own name without making it clear that he is 
signing it only as agent. 
 
(d) When an agent acts for a principal who cannot be sued (e.g., he is minor), the agent is personally 
liable. 
 
(e) An agent is liable for breach of warranty of authority. Where a person contracts as agent without 
any authority there is a breach of warranty of authority. He is liable to the person who has relied on 
the warranty of authority and has suffered loss. 
 
(f) Where authority is one coupled with interest or where trade, usage or custom makes the agent 
personally liable, he will be liable to the third-party. 
 
(g) He is also liable for his torts committed in the course of agency. 
Meaning of Authority Coupled with Interest (Section 202) 
An agency is coupled with an interest when the agent has an interest in the authority granted to him or when 
the agent has an interest in the subject matter with which he is authorised to deal. Where the agent was 
appointed to enable him to secure some benefit already owed to him by the principal, the agency was 
coupled with an interest. For example, where a factor had made advances to the principal and is authorised 
to sell at the best price and recoup the advances made by him or where the agent is authorised to collect 
money from third-parties and pay himself the debt due by the principal, the agencies are coupled with 
interest. But a mere arrangement that the agent’s remuneration to paid out of the rents collected by him, it 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
527 
does not give him any interest in the property and the agency is not the one coupled with an interest. An 
agency coupled with interest cannot be terminated in the absence of a contract to the contrary to the 
prejudice of such interest. 
The principal laid down in Section 202 applies only if the following conditions are fulfilled: 
 
(i) The interest of the agent should exist at the time of creation of agency and should not have arisen 
after the creation of agency. 
 
(ii) Authority given to the agent must be intended for the protection of the interest of the agent. 
 
(iii) The interest of the agent in the subject matter must be substantial and not ordinary. 
 
(iv) The interest of the agent should be over and above his remuneration. Mere prospect of 
remuneration is not sufficient interest. 
Termination of Agency 
An agency comes to an end or terminates— 
 
(a) By the performance of the contract of agency; (Section 201) 
 
(b) By an agreement between the principal and the agent; 
 
(c) By expiration of the period fixed for the contract of agency; 
 
(d) By the death of the principal or the agency; (Section 201) 
 
(e) By the insanity of either the principal or the agent; (Section 201) 
 
(f) By the insolvency of the principal, and in some cases that of the agent; (Section 201) 
 
(g) Where the principal or agent is an incorporated company, by its dissolution; 
 
(h) By the destruction of the subject-matter; (Section 56) 
 
(i) By the renunciation of his authority by the agent; (Section 201) 
 
(j) By the revocation of authority by the principal. (Section 201) 
When Agency is Irrevocable 
Revocation of an agency by the principal is not possible in the following cases: 
 
(a) Where the authority of agency is one coupled with an interest, even the death or insanity of the 
principal does not terminate the authority in this case (Section 202). 
 
(b) When agent has incurred personal liability, the agency becomes irrevocable. 
 
(c) When the authority has been partly exercised by the agent, it is irrevocable in particular with regard 
to obligations which arise from acts already done (Section 204). 
When Termination Takes Effect 
Termination of an agency takes effect or is complete, as regards the agent when it becomes known to the 
agent. If the principal revokes the agents authority, the revocation will take effect when the agent comes to 
know of it. As regards the third-parties, the termination takes effect when it comes to their knowledge 
(Section 208). Thus, if an agent whose authority has been terminated to his knowledge, enters into a 
contract with a third-party who deals with him bona fide, the contract will be binding on the principal as 
against the third-party. The termination of an agent’s authority terminates the authority of the sub-agent 
appointed by the agent (Section 210). 
EP-EBCL 
528 
The revocation of agency as regards the agent and as regards the principal takes effect at different points of 
time. Section 209 charges the agent with duty to protect the principal’s interest where the principal dies or 
becomes of unsound mind. It provides that when an agency is terminated by the principal dying or becoming 
of unsound mind, the agent is bound to take, on behalf of the representatives of his late principal, all 
reasonable steps for the protection and preservation of the interest entrusted to him. So it is the duty of the 
agent to take all steps to protect the interest of his deceased principal on his death. 
JOINT VENTURE/ FOREIGN COLLABORATION/MULTINATIONAL AGREEMENTS 
International business professionals use the term “modes of entry” to describe the different methods and 
approaches available to enter markets and conduct business in other countries. One mode of entry is the 
joint venture where two or more organizations join together in a cooperative effort to further their business 
goals. The joint venture is one of the most common and effective means of conducting business 
internationally. The joint venture documents and agreements are critical to the success of the venture. The 
joint venture agreement forms the basis of the understanding between and among the parties. It is relied 
upon to ensure that all parties understand their roles, rights, responsibilities, and remedies in the conduct of 
the venture. Organizations enter into joint ventures in good faith but closely scrutinize the joint venture 
documents if anything goes awry. 
The importance of the documents and the purpose of this part is to cover, step by step, the critical elements 
to consider and include in joint venture agreements. Equity participation, for example, may or may not be as 
important as operational control. Technical participation in the venture may or may not be as important as the 
intellectual property rights that may result from the venture. A key to developing joint venture agreements is 
to determine goals and objectives in advance and ensure that the interests are reflected in the agreement. 
Selection of a good local partner is the key to the success of any joint venture. Personal interviews with a 
prospective joint venture partner should be supplemented with proper due diligence. Once a partner is 
selected generally the parties highlighting the basis of the future joint venture agreement sign a 
memorandum of understanding or a letter of intent. Before signing the joint venture agreement, the terms 
should be thoroughly discussed to avoid any misunderstanding at a later stage. Negotiations require an 
understanding of the cultural and legal background of the parties. 
It is difficult to prepare a set frame of the terms and conditions. The conditions may differ according to the 
requirements. While drafting a foreign collaboration agreement, the following factors should be kept in mind: 
 
▬ Capability of the collaborator and the requirements of the party are clearly indicated. 
 
▬ Clear definitions of technical terms are given.

E-CONTRACT  
Electronic contracts are not paper based but rather in electronic form are born out of the need for speed, 
convenience and efficiency. In the electronic age, the whole transaction can be completed in seconds, with 
both parties simply affixing their digital signatures to an electronic copy of the contract. There was initially an 
apprehension amongst the legislatures to recognize this modern technology, but now many countries have 
enacted laws to recognize electronic contracts. The conventional law relating to contracts is not sufficient to 
address all the issues that arise in electronic contracts. The Information Technology Act, 2000 solves some 
of the peculiar issues that arise in the formation and authentication of electronic contracts 
As in every other contract, an electronic contract also requires the following necessary ingredients: 
An offer needs to be made 
The offer needs to be accepted 
There has to be lawful consideration 
There has to be an intention to create legal relations 
The parties must be competent to contract 
There must be free and genuine consent 
The object of the contract must be lawful 
There must be certainty and possibility of performance.  
LESSON ROUND-UP 
• A contract is an agreement enforceable at law, made between two or more persons, by which rights are 
acquired by one or more to acts or forbearances on the part of the other or others. 
• Every promise and every set of promises, forming the consideration for each other, is an agreement. 
• All agreements are contracts if they are made by the free consent of parties competent to contract, for a 
lawful consideration and with a lawful object, and are not hereby expressly declared to be void. 
EP-EBCL

• In flaw contract There may be the circumstances under which a contract made under these rules may still 
be bad, because there is a flaw, vice or error somewhere. As a result of such a flaw, the apparent 
agreement is not a real agreement. 
• Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act states that every agreement by which any one is restrained from 
exercising a lawful profession, trade or business of any kind, is, to that extent, void. 
• The literal meaning of the word “wager” is a “bet”. Wagerning agreements are nothing but ordinary betting 
agreements. 
• An agreement not enforceable by law is void ab initio. 
• A contingent contract is a contract to do or not to do something, if some event collateral to such contract, 
does or does not happen. Contract of insurance and contracts of indemnity and guarantee are popular 
instances of contingent contracts. 
• A quasi-contract rests on the equitable principle that a person shall not be allowed to enrich himself unjustly 
at the expense of another. In truth, it is not a contract at all. It is an obligation which the law creates, in the 
absence of any agreement, when any person is in the possession of one persons money, or its equivalent, 
under such circumstances that in equity and good conscience he ought not to retain it, and which in justice 
and fairness belongs to another. It is the duty and not an agreement or intention which defines it. 
• A contract is said to be discharged or terminated when the rights and obligations arising out of a contract 
are extinguished. 
• Where a contract is broken, the injured party has several courses of action open to him. The appropriate 
remedy in any case will depend upon the subject-matter of the contract and the nature of the breach. 
• A contract of indemnity is a contract by which one party promises to save the other party from loss caused 
to him by the conduct of the promisor himself, or by the conduct of any other person. 
• A bailment is a transaction whereby one person delivers goods to another person for some purpose, upon a 
contract that they are, when the purpose is accomplished to be returned or otherwise disposed of according 
to the directions of the person delivering them.

INTRODUCTION 
The law relating to specific relief in India is provided in the Specific Relief Act of 1963. The Specific Relief 
Act, 1963 was enacted to define and amend the law relating to certain kinds of specific relief. 
The expression ‘specific relief’ means a relief in specie. It is a remedy which aims at the exact fulfillment of 
an obligation. 
Scope of the Act 
The Specific Relief Act, 1963 is not exhaustive. It does not consolidate the whole law on the subject. As the 
Preamble would indicate, it is an Act ”to define and amend the law relating to certain kinds of specific relief”. 
It does not purport to lay down the law relating to specific relief in all its ramifications (AIR 1972 SC 1826) 
There are other kinds of specific remedy provided for by other enactments e.g. the Transfer of Property Act 
deals with the specific remedies available to a mortgagor or mortgagee; the Partnership Act deals with the 
specific remedies like dissolution and accounts as between partners. 
Under the Specific Relief Act, 1963, remedies have been divided as specific relief (Sections 5-35) and 
preventive relief (Sections 36-42). These are: 
 
(i) Recovering possession of property (Sections 5-8); 
 
(ii) Specific performance of contracts (Sections 9-25); 
 
(iii) Rectification of Instruments (Section 26); 
 
(iv) Rescission of contracts (Sections 27-30); 
 
(v) Cancellation of Instruments (Section 31-33); 
 
(vi) Declaratory decrees (Sections 34-35); and 
 (vii) Injunctions (Sections 36-42). 
Who May Sue for Specific Performance 
Section 15 lays down that specific performance of a contract may be obtained by (a) any party thereto; (b) 
the representative in interest or the principal, of any party thereto; provided that where the learning, skill, 
insolvency or any personal quality of such party is a material ingredient in the contract, or where the contract 
provides that his interest shall not be assigned, his representative in interest or his principal shall not be 
entitled to specific performance of the contract, unless such party has already performed his part of the 
contract, or the performance thereof by his representative in interest, or his principal, has been accepted by 
the other party; (c) where the contract is a settlement on marriage, or a compromise of doubtful rights 
between members of the same family, any person beneficially entitled thereunder; (d) where the contract has 
been entered into by tenant-for-life in due exercise of a power the remainder man; (e) a reversioner in 
possession, where the agreement is a convenant entered into with his predecessor in title and the 
reversioner is entitled to the benefit of such convenant; (f) a reversioner in remainder, where the agreement 
is such a covenant, and the reversioner is entitled to the benefit thereof and will sustain material injury by 
reason of its breach; (g) when a company has entered into a contract and subsequently becomes 
amalgamated with another company the new company which arises out of the amalgamation; (h) when the 
promoters of a company have, before its incorporation, entered into a contract for the purpose of the 
company and such a contract is warranted by the terms of the incorporation of the company provided that 
the company has accepted the contract and has communicated such acceptance to the other party to the 
contract. 
                                                                       Lesson 21        Specific Relief Act, 1963 533 
Generally, only a party to the contract can get its specific performance. The section gives the list of persons 
who can sue for specific performance of a contract. The general principle is that in a suit for specific 
performance of a contract, all the parties to the contract should be parties to the suit and no one else. 
Contracts which can be specifically enforced 
Section 10 provides the cases in which specific performance of contract is enforceable. It says that except as 
otherwise provided in this Chapter, the specific performance of any contract may, in the discretion of the 
Court, be enforced (a) when there exists no standard for ascertaining the actual damage caused by the non-
performance of the act agreed to be done, or (b) when the act agreed to be done is such that compensation 
in money for its non-performance would not afford adequate relief. The explanation provides that unless and 
until the contrary is proved, the Court shall presume: 
(i) that the breach of a contract to transfer immovable property cannot be adequately relieved by 
compensation in money, and (ii) that the breach of a contract to transfer movable property can be so relieved 
except in the two cases: (a) where the property is not an ordinary article of commerce or is of special value 
or interest to the plaintiff, or consists of goods which are not easily obtainable in the market, and (b) where 
the property is held by the defendant as the agent or trustee of the plaintiff. 
So, under this Section, contracts for sale of patent right, copy right, shares of a company which are not easily 
available, future property, chattels of special value, etc., are specifically enforceable. In an agreement for 
sale of agricultural land, the respondent vendor wilfully avoided the execution of sale deed after receiving full 
sale consideration. Rajasthan High Court held that compensation by way of damages would not be 
substituted to execution of sale deed. The Court directed the respondents to enforce the specific 
performance of the agreement (Ram Karan and others v. Govind Lal and other, AIR 1999 Raj. 167). In a suit 
for specific performance of contract of sale of a house, a stranger to the contract cannot seek to be 
impleaded. That will change the very nature of the suit. 
Cases in which specific performance of contracts connected with trusts enforceable 
Section 11 lays down that except as otherwise provided in this Act, specific performance of a contract may, 
in the discretion of the Court, be enforced when the act agreed to be done is in the performance wholly or 
partly of a trust. But if a trustee enters into a contract in excess of his powers then such a contract cannot be 
specifically enforced. 
Illustrations 
A contracts with B to paint a picture for B and B agrees to pay Rs. 1000 for the same. The picture is painted. 
‘B’ is entitled to have it delivered to him on payment or tender of Rs. 1,000. 
A is a trustee of land with power of lease it for 7 years. He enters into a contract with B to grant a lease of the 
land for 7 years, with a covenant to renew the lease at the expiry of the term. This contract cannot be 
specifically enforced. 
The directors of company have power to sell the concern with the sanction of a general meeting of the 
shareholders, Directors contract to sell it without any such sanction. This contract cannot be specifically 
enforced. 
Specific performance of part of a contract 
Section 12 deals with specific performance of a part of a contract. Sub-section (1) lays down the general 
principle that except as otherwise hereinafter provided in this section, the Court shall not direct the specific 
EP-EBCL 
534 
performance of a part of a contract. Sub-sections (2)-(4) lay down the exceptions to this general rule as 
follows: 
(i) Sub-section 2 says that where a party to a contract is unable to perform the whole of his part of it, but the 
part which must be left unperformed by only a small proportion to the whole in value and admits of 
compensation in money, the Court may, at the suit of the either party, direct the specific performance of so 
much of the contract as can be performed and award compensation in money for the deficiency. 
A contracts to sell B a piece of land consisting of 100 bighas. It turns out that 98 bighas of the land belongs 
to A and the two remaining bighas to a stranger, who refuses to part with them. The two bighas are not 
necessary for the use of enjoyment of the 98 bighas, nor so important for such use or enjoyment that the loss 
of them may not be made in goods in money. A may be directed at the suit of B to convey to B the 98 bighas 
and to make compensation to him. For not conveying the two remaining bighas; B may be directed at the suit 
of A, to pay to A, on receiving the conveyance and possession of the land, the stipulated purchase money 
less the sum awarded as compensation for the deficiency. 
(ii) Sub-section 3 lays down that where a party to a contract is unable to perform the whole of his part of it, 
and the part which must be left unperformed either (a) forms a considerable part of the whole, though 
admitting of compensation in money; or (b) does not admit of compensation in money; he is not entitled to 
obtain a decree for specific performance; but the Court may, at the suit of the other party, direct the party in 
default to perform specifically so much of his part of the contract as he can perform, if the party (i) in a case 
falling under clause (a), pays or has paid the agreed consideration for the whole of the contract reduced by 
the consideration for the part which must be left unperformed and in a case falling under clause (b), pays or 
has paid the consideration for the whole of the contract without any abatement, and (ii) in either case, 
relinquishes all claims to the performance of the remaining part of the contract and all rights to 
compensation, either for the deficiency or for the loss or damage sustained by him through the default of the 
defendant. 
For 
example, 
A 
contracts 
to 
sell 
B 
a 
piece 
of 
land 
consisting 
of 
100 
bighas 
for  
Rs. 1,00,000. It turns out that only 50 bighas of land belong to A. 50 bighas are substantial part of the 
contract. A cannot demand specific performance of the contract but B can demand specific performance to 
get 50 bighas of land from A by paying the full consideration i.e. Rs. 1,00,000. 
(iii) Sub-section 4 lays down that when a part of a contract which taken by itself, can and ought to be 
specifically performed, stands on a separate and independent footing from another part of the same contract 
which cannot or ought not to be specifically performed, the Court may direct specific performance of the 
former part. For the purposes of this section, a party to the contract shall be deemed to be unable to perform 
the whole of his part of it, if a portion of its subject matter existing at the date of the contract has ceased to 
exist at the time of its performance. 
Section 13 lays down the rights of a purchaser or lessee against the seller or lessor with no title or imperfect 
title. It lays down that where a person contracts to sell or let certain immovable property having no title or 
only an imperfect title, the purchaser or lessee (subject to the other provisions of this Chapter) has the 
following rights, namely: (a) if the vendor or lessor has, subsequent to the contract, acquired any interest in 
the property, the purchaser or lessee may compel him to make good the contract out of such interest; (b) 
where the concurrence of other persons is necessary for validating the title, and they are bound to convey at 
the request of the vendor or lessor, the purchaser or lessee may compel him to procure such concurrence 
and when conveyance by other person is necessary to validate the title and they are bound to convey at the 
request of the vendor or lessor, the purchaser or lessee may compel him to procure such conveyance; (c) 
where the vendor professes to sell unencumbered property but the property is, mortgaged for an amount not 
                                                                       Lesson 21        Specific Relief Act, 1963 535 
exceeding the purchase money and the vendor has in fact only a right to redeem it, the purchaser may 
compel him to redeem the mortgage and to obtain a valid discharge, and, where necessary, also a 
conveyance from the mortgagee; (d) where the vendor or lessor sues for specific performance of the contract 
and the suit is dismissed on the ground of his want of title, or imperfect title, the defendant has a right to a 
return of his deposit, interest and costs on the interest, if any, of the vendor or lessor in the property which is 
the subject matter of the contract. Sub-section (2) of Section 13 lays down that the aforesaid provisions of 
the sections shall also supply, as far as may be to contracts for or hire of movable property. 
Contracts which cannot be specifically enforced 
Section 14 lays down the contracts which cannot be specifically enforced. They are (a) A contract for the 
non-performance of which compensation in money is an adequate relief; (b) A contract which runs into such 
minute and numerous details that the Court cannot enforce specific performance of its material terms or 
which is dependant upon the personal qualification or volition of the parties or a contract from its nature is 
such that the Court cannot enforce specific performance; (c) A contract which is in its nature determinable; 
(d) A contract, the performance of which involves the performance of a continuous duty which the court 
cannot supervise. Sub-section (2) lays down that save as provided by the Arbitration Act, 1943, no contract 
to refer present or future difference to arbitration shall be specifically enforced; but if any person who has 
made such a contract (other than an arbitration agreement to which the provisions for the said Act apply) and 
has refused to perform it, sues in respect of any subject which he has contracted to refer, the existence of 
such a contract shall bar the suit. 
Sub-section (3) lays down that notwithstanding anything contained in clause (a) or clause (c) or clause (d) of 
Sub-section (1), the Court may enforce specific performance in the following cases: (a) where the suit is for 
the enforcement of a contract—(i) to execute a mortage or furnish any other security for securiing the 
repayment of any loan which the borrower is not willing to repay at once; provided that where only a part of 
the loan has been advanced the vendor is willing to advance the remaining part of the loan in terms of the 
contract; or (ii) to take up and pay for any debentures of a company; (b) where the suit is for (i) the execution 
of a formal deed of partnership, the parties having commenced to carry on the business, or (ii) the purchase 
of a share of a partner of a firm (c) where the suit is for the enforcement of a contract for the construction of 
any building or the execution of any other work on land provided that the following conditions are fulfilled, 
namely, (i) the building or other work is described in the contract in terms sufficiently precise to enable the 
Court to determine the exact nature of the building or work; (ii) the plaintiff has a substantial interest in the 
performance of the contract and the interest is of such a nature that compensation in money for non-
performance of the contract is not an adequate relief; and (iii) the defendant has, in pursuance of the 
contract, obtained possession of the land on which the building is to be constructed or other work is to be 
executed. 
Illustrations 
A contracts to sell and B contracts to buy, one lakh of rupees in the four per cent Central Government loan; 
the contract may be specifically performed. 
A contracts to render personal service to B or A contracts to marry B or A contracts to employ B on personal 
service or A, an author, contracts with B, a publisher to complete a literary work. B cannot enforce specific 
performance of these contracts. Not only contract of personal service, but any contract requiring personal 
skill, knowledge or volition of the parties, for example, to marry, to paint a picture, to complete a literary work 
or to sing or act at a theatre will not be specifically enforced as such contracts would require a constant and 
general superintendence as cannot be conveniently undertaken by a Court of Justice. 
EP-EBCL 
536 
A and B contract to become partners, the contract is not specifying the duration of the proposed partnership. 
In such a case the contract cannot be specifically enforced since, either A and B might at once dissolve the 
partnership (Scott v. Rayment (1868) L.R. 7 Eq. 112). 
The Court will not decree specific performance of an agreement if it be of such a nature that better justice will 
be done by leaving the parties to their remedy in damages (Wilson v. Northampton & Banbury Junction Rly. 
Co. (1874) 9 C.H. App. 279).  
The very foundation of specific performance of a contract is that an award for damages does not afford the 
aggrieved party a complete remedy. If in the opinion of the Court damages will be an adequate remedy, 
specific performance of the contract cannot be decreed (Ramji Patel v. Rao Kishore, (1929) P.C. 190).  
In such a case pecuniary compensation is equated with the specific performance of the contract. It can be 
decreed only when the remedy at law is not adequate or is defective. The court may come to the conclusion 
that the ends of justice will be served better by awarding the damages instead of the specific performance of 
the contract. 
A Contract may be specifically enforced: 
 
(a) If it is one for non-performance of which the mere payment of money would not be an adequate 
relief; and 
 
(b) the contract is otherwise, proper to be specifically enforced. Section 14(1)(b) provides three reasons 
for refusing specific performance: 
 
(i) When a contract runs into minute or numerous details; or 
 
(ii) When a contract is dependent upon the personal qualification or volition of the parties; or 
 
(iii) When the contract by nature is such that the Court cannot enforce, specific performance of its 
material terms. 
In the same way, contracts of personal service cannot be specifically enforced. These contracts are based 
upon the personal relations of the parties. They require mutual trust and confidence of the parties. When the 
contract is for personal service, it requires some skill or talent or of some intellectual pursuit, and in that case 
a decree for its specific performance cannot be passed by the court, as it will never know if the decree has 
been truthfully and fully executed. The Court will refuse specific performance of a contract if it is of such a 
nature that the Court cannot enforce its specific performance. 
Under Section 14(1)(c) contracts which are in their nature determinable cannot be specifically enforced. 
The Court will not enforce a contract which is in its nature determinable by the defendant. Determinable 
contract is such a contract where one of the parties can put an end to it. So even if a decree is passed, the 
defendant by putting an end to the contract, will evade the decree. A and B contract to become partners in a 
certain business, the contract not specifying the duration of the proposed partnership can not be specifically 
performed, for if it were so performed, either A or B might at once dissolve the partnership. 
Recovery of Possession of Movable and Immovable Property 
Sections 5 to 8 deal with recovery of possession of property. Property may either be (i) immovable, or (ii) 
movable. Sections 5 and 6 deal with recovery of possession of immovable property while Sections 7 and 8 
deal with movable property. 
                                                                       Lesson 21        Specific Relief Act, 1963 537 
Recovery of possession of specific immovable property 
According to Section 5, a person, entitled to the possession of specific immovable property may recover the 
same in the manner provided by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The word ‘person’ includes any 
company or association or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not. The action under Section 5 
arises when claim is made on the basis of “title”. 
RECOVERY OF POSSESSION OF DISPOSSESSED IMMOVABLE PROPERTY 
The Act provides another relief under Section 6 for the recovery of possession of immovable property where 
the claim is based merely on ‘possession’. Section 6 provides that if any person is dispossessed without his 
consent, of immovable property otherwise than in due course of Law, he or any person claiming through him 
may be suit recover possession thereof, notwithstanding any other title that may be set up in such a suit. 
There are two restrictions; no suit under Section 6 shall be brought (i) after the expiry of 6 months from the 
date of dispossession, or (ii) against the Government. Under Sub-section (3) no appeal or review is allowed 
of any order of decree passed under this Section. Sub-section (4) allows a person to file a suit to establish 
his title to such property and recover possession thereof. 
The object of these provisions is to discourage people from taking the law into their own hands. The Sections 
provide a speedy and summary remedy through a medium of Civil Court for restoration of possession to the 
dispossed. Section 5 thus provides for a suit for ejectment on the basis of title and Section 6 gives a remedy 
without establishing title provided the suit is brought within 6 months of the date of possession. The object of 
Section 6 is to discourage forcible dispossession and to enable the person dispossessed to recover 
possession by merely providing previous possession and wrongful dispossession without proving title 
(Lachman v. Shambu Narain, ILR (1911) 33 ALL 174). A suit under Section 6 is maintainable between 
landlords and tenants. Heirs are also entitled to sue for recovery of possession. 
Recovery of specific movable property 
A person is entitled to recover the possession of specific movable property in the manner provided by the 
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. (Section 7) 
Explanation 1: A trustee may sue for possession of movable property of which he is a trustee. The term 
‘trustee’ includes every person holding property in trust. 
Explanation 2: A special or temporary right to the present possession of movable property is sufficient to 
support a suit under this section. 
Illustrations 
 
(a)  A bequeaths land to B for his life, with remainder to C. A dies, B enters on the land, but C, without 
B’s consent, obtains possession of the title deeds, B may recover them from C. 
 
(b)  A pledges certain jewels to B to secure a loan. B disposes of them before he is entitled to do so. A, 
without having paid or tendered the amount of the loan, sues B for possession of the jewels. The 
suit should be dismissed, as A is not entitled to their possession, whatever right he may have to 
secure their safe custody (See Donald v. Suckling (1866) L.R. 1 Q.B. 585). 
 
(c)  A receives a letter addressed to him by B. B gets back the letter without A’s consent. A has such a 
property therein as entitles him to recover it from B (Oliver v. Oliver (1861) 11 C.B.N.S. 139). 
 
(d)  A deposits books and papers for safe custody with B. B losses them and C finds them, but refuses 
to deliver them to B when demanded. B may recover them from C, subject to C’s right, if any, under 
Section 168 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.

(e)  A, a warehouse-keeper, is charged with the delivery of certain goods to Z, which B takes out of A’s 
possession. A may sue B for the goods. 
An action in detinue would lie only for some specific article of movable property capable of being recovered 
in specie and of being seized and delivered up to the winning party. Section 7 lays down that a person 
entitled to the possession of specific movable property may recover the same in the manner prescribed by 
the Civil Procedure Code. A trustee or a person having a special or a temporary right to the present 
possession may also file a suit under this section. 
Liability of person in possession, not as owner to deliver to persons entitled to immediate 
possession 
Section 8 lays down that any person having the possession or control of a particular article of movable 
property of which he is not the owner, may be compelled specifically, to deliver it to the person entitled to its 
immediate possession in any of the following four cases: 
 
(a) When the thing claimed is held by the defendant as the agent or trustee of the plaintiff, 
 
(b) when the compensation in money would not afford the plaintiff adequate relief for the loss of the 
thing claimed, 
 
(c) when it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the actual damage caused by its loss, 
 
(d) when the possession of the thing claimed has been wrongfully transferred from the plaintiff. 
Unless and until the contrary is proved, the Court shall, in respect of any article of movable property claimed 
under clause (b) or (c) of this section presume that (i) compensation in money would not afford the plaintiff 
adequate relief for the loss of the thing claimed or as the case may be, and (ii) it would be extremely difficult 
to ascertain the actual damage caused by its loss. 
Thus under this part of the Act, if a person, who has been dispossessed, does not bring a suit under Section 
6 of the Specific Relief Act within 6 months, he may still bring a suit for recovery alleging any title to the 
property. But in this case, the suit may be defeated by the defendant by proving a better title. 
Illustrations 
 
(a)  A, proceeding to Europe, leaves his furniture in charge of B, as his agent during his absence. B, 
without A’s authority, pledges the furniture to C, and C knowing that B had no right to pledge the 
furniture, advertises it for sale. C may be compelled to deliver the furniture to ‘A’ for he holds it as 
A’s trustee. 
 
(b)  Z has got possession of an idol belonging to A’s family, and of which A is the proper custodian. Z 
may be compelled to deliver the idol to A. 
 
(c)  ‘A’ is entitled to a picture by a dead painter and a pair of rare China vases. B has possession of 
them. The articles are of special character to bear an ascertainable market value. B may be 
compelled to deliver them to A. 
PERSONS AGAINST WHOM SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE AVAILABLE 
Section 15 lays down the parties who can bring an action for specific performance. 
According to Section 19, specific performance of a contract may be enforced against (a) either party thereto, 
(b) any person claiming under him, by a title arising subsequently to the contract except a transferee for 
value who has paid his money in good faith and without notice of the original contract, (c) any person 
claiming under a title which though prior to the contract, and known to the plaintiff, might have been 
displaced by the defendant, (d) when a company has entered into a contract and subsequently becomes 
                                                                       Lesson 21        Specific Relief Act, 1963 539 
amalgamated with another company — the new company which arises out of the amalgamation, (e) when 
the promoters of a company have before its incorporation entered into a contract, for the purpose of the 
company and such contract is warranted by the terms of the incorporation of the company; provided that the 
company has accepted the contract and communicated such acceptance to the other party to the contract. 
Clauses (a) and (b) embody the principle that Court will enforce specific performance of a contract not only 
against either party, thereto, but also against any person claiming under either of the parties, a title arising 
subsequently to the contract, except a transferee for value who has paid money in good faith and without 
notice of the original contract. 
Examples to clause (c) are voluntary alienness, joint tenants claiming survivorship and remainder man. 
PERSONS AGAINST WHOM SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE CANNOT BE ENFORCED 
Under Section 16, specific performance of a contract cannot be enforced in favour of a person — (a) who 
would not be entitled to recover compensation for its breach, or (b) who has became incapable of 
performing, or violates any essential term of the contract that on his part remains to be performed, or acts in 
fraud of the contract, or wilfully acts at variance with, or in subversion of, the relation intended to be 
established by the contract, or (c) who fails to aver and prove that he has performed or has always been 
ready and willing to perform the essential terms of the contract which are to be performed by him, other than 
terms the performance of which has been prevented or waived by the defendant. The obligation imposed by 
Section 16 of the Act is upon the Court not to grant specific performance to a plaintiff who has not met the 
requirements of clause (a), (b) and (c) thereof. 
Thus in a suit for specific performance the plaintiff should not only plead and prove the terms of the 
agreement but should also plead and prove his readiness and willingness to perform his obligations under 
the contract in terms of the contract. 
To adjudge whether the plaintiff is ready and willing to perform his part of the contract, the court must take 
into consideration the conduct of the plaintiff prior and subsequent to the filing of the suit along with other 
attending circumstances. Right from the date of the execution till the date of the decree he must prove that 
he is ready and has always been willing to perform his part of the contract. N.P. Thirgnanam v. Dr. R Jagan 
Mohan Rao, AIR 1996 SC 116, (1995) 5 SCC 115. 
The continuous readiness and willingness on the part of the plaintiff is a condition precedent to grant the 
relief of specific performance. The circumstance is material and relevant and is required to be considered by 
the Court while granting or refusing to grant the relief. If the plaintiff fails to either aver or prove the same he 
must fail. 
A Court may not, therefore, grant to a plaintiff who has failed to to prove that he has performed or has always 
been ready and willing to perform his part of the agreement, the specific performance whereof he seeks (See 
Ram Awadh v. Achhaibar Dubey, AIR 2000 SC 860).  
The explanation states that for the purpose of clause (c), (i) where a contract involved the payment of 
money, it is not essential for the plaintiff to actually tender to the defendant or to deposit in Court any money 
except when so directed by the Court (ii) the plaintiff must aver performance of, or readiness and willingness 
to perform, the contract according to its construction. 
Section 17 sets out two more cases where specific performance cannot be enforced in favour of a vendor or 
lessor. It states that a contract to sell or let any immovable property cannot be specifically enforced in favour of 
vendor or lessor (a) who knowing himself not to have any title to the property, has contracted to sell or let the 
property; (b) who, though he entered into the contract believing that he had a good title to the property, cannot 
at the time fixed by the parties or by the Court for the completion of the sale or letting, give the purchaser or 
lessee a title free from reasonable doubt sub-section (2) lays down that the provisions of Sub-section (1) shall 
also apply as far as may be, to contracts for the sale or hire of movable property. 
EP-EBCL 
540 
According to this Section, a contract to sell or hire property cannot be specifically enforced in favour of a 
seller or lessor if he had no title to the property. A person who knows that he has no title to the property but 
still enters into a contract with regard to that property, he cannot have the remedy of specific performance. It 
is the duty of the vendor to make a reasonable, clear and marketable title about which there must not be any 
rational doubt. 
Illustration 
A without C’s authority contracts to sell to B an estate which A knows to belong to C. A cannot enforce 
specific performance of this contract even though C is willing to confirm it. 
Non-enforcement except with variation 
According to Section 18, where a plaintiff seeks specific performance of a contract in writing, to which the 
defendant sets up a variation, the plaintiff cannot obtain the performance sought, except with the variation so 
set up in the following cases, namely: (a) where by fraud, mistake of fact or misrepresentation, the written 
contract of which performance is sought is in its terms or effect different from what the parties agreed to, or 
does not contain all the terms agreed to between the parties on the basis of which the defendant entered into 
the contract; (b) where the object of the parties was to produce a certain legal result which the contract as 
framed is not calculated to produce, (c) where the parties have subsequently to the execution of the contract, 
varied its terms. 
Illustration 
A contracts in writing to let a house to B for a certain term, at the rent of Rs. 100/- per month, putting it first 
into tenantable repair. The house turns out to be not worth repairing. So with B’s consent, A pulls it down and 
erects a new house in its place. B contracting orally to pay rent at Rs. 120/- per month. B then sues to 
enforce specific performance of the contract in writing. He cannot enforce it except with the variations made 
by the subsequent oral contract. 
DISCRETION OF THE COURT 
Sub-section (1) of Section 20 lays down that the jurisdiction to decree specific performance is discretionary, 
and the Court is not bound to grant such relief merely because it is lawful to do so, but the discretion of the 
Court is not arbitrary but based on sound and reasonable grounds guided by judicial principles and capable 
of correction by a Court of appeal. Sub-section (2) lays down that the following are cases in which the Court 
may properly exercise discretion not to decree specific performance —  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                       Lesson 21        Specific Relief Act, 1963 541 
Explanation 1 appended to the Section states that mere inadequacy of consideration, or the more fact that 
the contract is onerous to the defendant or improvident in its nature, shall not be deemed to constitute an 
unfair advantage within the meaning of clause (a) or hardship within the meaning of clause (b) Explanation 2 
to the Section says that the question whether the performance of a contract would involve hardship on the 
defendant within the meaning of clause (b) shall, except in cases where the hardship has resulted from any 
act of the plaintiff subsequent to the contract, be determined with reference to the circumstances existing at 
the time of the contract. 
Sub-section (3) lays down that Court may properly exercise discretion to decree specific performance in any 
case where the plaintiff has done substantial acts or suffered losses in consequences of a contract capable 
of specific performance. Sub-section (4) says that the court shall not refuse to any party specific performance 
of a contract merely on the ground that the contract is not enforceable at the instance of the other party. 
Specific performance is a discretionary remedy. The Court is not bound to decree specific performance 
merely because it is lawful to do so. Courts can take into consideration the conduct of the parties and the 
circumstances attending its execution and may exercise a discretion in granting or withholding a decree for 
specific performance (Jethalal v. Bachu, 47 Bom. 46). However, this discretion is not an arbitrary discretion 
but one governed by sound principles of equity. It has been held that the court is not bound to grant relief of 
specific performance even if it is lawful to do so. [Yellapa Sastri v. Gunda Shankara, AIR 2010 (NOC) 731 
A.P. See also AIR 2008 SC 1786]. 
Illustration 
In Dennev-light (1857) 8 D M & G 774, the Court refused specific performance against a buyer where the 
land contracted to be purchased was wholly surrounded by land belonging to others over which there was no 
right of way. 
It is to be noted that the word ‘mere’ has to be given due weight. Specific performance may be refused where 
inadequacy of consideration is coupled with some other factor not necessarily amounting to fraud, e.g. 
mistake, or surprise, or unfair advantage taken by the plaintiff of his superior knowledge or bargaining 
position even though the circumstances do not justify rescission of the contract. 
The hardship to be considered is at the time of the contract, unless the hardship has been brought on by the 
action of the plaintiff. Mere rise in price of the property agreed to be sold is not a ground for refusing a 
discretionary relief in favour of the purchaser. What has to be considered is the fairness of the contract at the 
time it was made and the subsequent rise in price is not a matter to be taken into consideration. 
Court’s power to award damages in certain cases 
Under Section 21 of the Specific Relief Act, the Court is empowered to award compensation in certain cases. 
Sub-section (1) states that in a suit for specific performance of a contract, the plaintiff may also claim 
compensation for its breach, either in addition to, or in substitution of such performance, Sub-section (2) 
states that if, in any suit the Court decides that specific performance ought not to be granted but that there is 
a contract between the parties which has been broken by the defendant and that the plaintiff is entitled to 
compensation for that breach, it shall award him such compensation accordingly. Sub-section 3 lays down 
that if, in any such suit the Court decides that specific performance ought to be granted, but that it is not 
sufficient to satisfy the justice of the case, and that some compensation for breach of the contract should 
also be made to the plaintiff, it shall award him such compensation accordingly. Sub-section (4) states that in 
determining the amount of any compensation awarded under this section, the Court shall be guided by the 
principles specified in Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Sub-section 5 lays down that no 
compensation shall be awarded under this Section unless the plaintiff has claimed such compensation in his 
EP-EBCL 
542 
plaint provided that where the plaintiff has not claimed any such compensation in the plaint, the Court shall at 
any stage at the proceeding, allow him to amend the plaint on such terms as may be just for including a 
claim for such compensation. Even if the contract has become incapable of specific performance that does 
not preclude the Court from exercising the jurisdiction conferred by this section. 
The conditions according to which damages may be awarded by the Court in addition to specific 
performance are: 
 
(i) the Court decides that specific performance ought to be granted but, 
 
(ii) the justice of the case requires that not only specific performance but also some compensation for 
the breach of the contract should also be given to the plaintiff. 
 
 In a suit for specific performance, the plaintiff may ask for damages in the alternative or in addition 
to specific performance of the contract. The Court’s power to award damages in a suit for specific 
performance is laid down in Section 21. 
The circumstances in which a court would award damages in lieu of specific performance: 
 
(a) Specific performance could have been granted but in the circumstances of the case the Court in its 
discretion considers that it would be better to award damages instead of specific performance. 
 
(b) Though specific performance is refused, plaintiff is entitled to compensation for breach of the 
contract. 
 
(c) If the circumstances are such that specific performance would not be granted; for example, where 
the plaintiff has disentitled himself to the specific performance, damages cannot be awarded under 
Section 21 in lieu of specific performance. 
Section 22 gives power to the Court to grant relief for possession, partitions, refund of earnest money. Under 
Section 22 any person, suing for the specific performance of a contract for the transfer of immovable 
property may, in an appropriate case ask for (a) possession or partition and separate possession, of the 
property in addition to any such performance; or (b) any other relief to which he may be entitled in case his 
claim for specific performance is refused. 
The power of the Court to grant relief under clause (b) shall be without prejudice to its power to award 
compensation under Section 21. 
Illustrations 
(a) A conveys land to B, who bequeaths it to C and dies. Thereupon D gets possession of the land and 
produces a forged instrument stating that the conveyance was made to B in trust for him. C may obtain the 
cancellation of the forged instrument. 
(b) A, representing that the tenants on his land were all at will, sells it to B, and conveys it to him by an 
instrument dated the 1st January 1877. Soon after that day, A fraudulently grants to C a lease of part of the 
land, and procures the lease dated the 1st October, 1876 to be registered under the Indian Registration Act. 
B may obtain the cancellation of this lease. 
On such cancellation, the Court may require the party to whom such relief is granted to restore as far as may 
be any benefit which he may have received from the other party and to make any compensation to him which 
justice may require. 
In a case defendant and plaintiff were real brothers residing jointly in a house. The defendant executed 
                                                                       Lesson 21        Specific Relief Act, 1963 543 
agreement to sell the property of his share in favour of plaintiff. Subsequently he sold the same property to 
another purchaser. The subsequent purchaser had no knowledge about the earlier agreement. It was held 
that he is the bona-fide purchaser of the property. The plaintiff can recover back earnest money paid by him 
to defendant (Jagtar Singh v. Gurmit Singh, AIR 2006 P&H 62). 
Section 23 lays down that even if the parties have agreed for liquidated damages, in the contract itself, 
specific performance of that contract may be decreed by the Court in proper cases but in that case the 
payment of the sum named in the contract will not be decreed. 
Section 24 imposes a bar on suit for compensation for breach of a contract after dismissal of the suit for 
specific performance. 
RECTIFICATION OF INSTRUMENTS 
Section 26 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 contains the law as to rectification of instruments. 
Rectification means correction of an error in an instrument in order to give effect to the real intention of the 
parties. Where a contract reduced into writing in pursuance of a previous agreement, fails to express the real 
intention of the parties, the court will rectify the instrument in accordance with their true intention. Here, there 
must be in existence as between the parties, a complete and perfectly unobjectionable contract; but the 
writing designed to embody it, either from fraud or mutual mistake, is incorrect or imperfect and the relief 
sought is to rectify the writing so as to bring it into confirmity with the true intention. In such a case, if such 
instrument is enforced, one party will suffer and if it is rescinded altogether both the parties will suffer but if it 
is rectified and enforced neither party will suffer. The principle on which the courts act in correcting 
instruments is that the parties are to be placed in the same position as that in which they would have stood if 
no error had been committed (Sudha Singh v. Munshi Ram, A.I.R. 1927 Cal. 605). There must have been a 
complete agreement prior to the instrument. It should be in writing and there must be clear evidence of 
mutual mistake or of fraud. 
In order to obtain rectificaion the conditions mentioned in Section 26 must be present. Thus: 
 
(i) Rectification would be granted where, though there was a consensus between the parties as to the 
contract through fraud of one of the parties, the instrument did not correctly express the real 
intention. 
 
(ii) It will also be granted, at the instance of third party, where both the parties are equally innocent, but 
owing to a common mistake, the instrument does not express their intention. 
 
(iii) Sub-section (2) makes it clear that rectification would not be allowed so as to prejudice rights 
acquired by third party in good faith and for value. 
 
 For example, A intending to sell to B his house and one of three godowns adjacent to it, executes a 
conveyance prepared by B in which through B’s fraud, all three godowns are included. Of the two 
godowns which were fraudulently included, B gives one to C and let the other to D for a rent, neither 
C nor D having any knowledge of the fraud. The conveyance may, as against B and C, be rectified 
so as to exclude from it the godown given to C, but it cannot be rectified so as to affect D’s lease. 
 
(iv) The only limitation placed on the Courts discretion is that the rectification can be done without 
prejudice to the rights acquired by third persons in good faith and for value. 
RESCISSION OF CONTRACTS 
Section 27 deals with Rescission of Contracts. “Rescission” means putting an end to a contract which is still 
operative and making it null and void ab initio. It does not apply to void contracts. Section 27 states the 
EP-EBCL 
544 
principle upon which rescission can be ordered. A person suing for rescission cannot, in the alternative sue 
for specific performance but a person suing for specific performance can sue for rescission. Sub-section (1) 
lays down that any person interested in a contract may sue to have it rescinded, and such rescission may be 
adjudged by the Court in any of the following cases, namely – (a) where the contract is voidable or 
terminable by the plaintiff; (b) where the contract is unlawful for causes not apparent on its face and the 
defendant is more to blame than the plaintiff. Sub-section (2) lays down that notwithstanding anything 
contained in Sub-section (1), the Court may refuse to rescind the contract – (a) where the plaintiff has 
expressly or impliedly ratified the contract; or (b) where, owing to the change of circumstances which has 
taken place since the making of the contract (not being due to any act of the defendant himself), the parties 
cannot be substantially restored to the position in which they stood when the contract was made; or (c) 
where third-parties have, during the subsistence of the contract, acquired rights in good faith without notice 
and for value; or (d) where only a part of the contract is sought to be rescinded and such part is not 
severable from the rest of the contract. The explanation provides that in this Section, “contract” in relation to 
the territories to which the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, does not extend, means a contract in writing. 
“This specie of specific relief is the reverse of specific performance. In one case the relief is granted by 
enforcing the performance of a contract which binds the parties, and the other by discharging him when it is 
not just to bind him” (Banerjee). So the equitable relief by way of rescission is exactly opposite of specific 
performance. Here, the contract is put to an end and is made null and void where by the contractual 
obligations also come to an end. Section 27 provides ground to the aggrieved party to rescind a contract 
without obtaining consent of the other party. 
Under clause (a) where a contract is voidable or terminable by the plaintiff, he may rescind it. The contract 
may become voidable or terminable due to fraud, undue influence, misrepresentation or coercion. 
Any person interested in a contract may sue to have it rescinded. Hence a suit may be brought by a third 
party whose interests are affected by the contract. 
In case of a rescission of a contract, the Court may, in its discretion, require the party to whom such relief is 
granted to make any compensation to the other party. The main object of this relief is to put both the parties 
in their original positions. If a plaintiff fails to get specific performance of a contract in writing, he may get it 
rescinded and delivered up to be cancelled. 
Doctrine of part performance 
The doctrine of part performance has been applied in India to the contracts of transfer of immovable property 
which though required to be registered have not been registered. The doctrine has been given statutory 
recognition in 1929 adding two new sections to Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act and Section 27A 
to the Specific Relief Act, and a proviso to Section 49 of the Indian Registration Act. 
CANCELLATION OF INSTRUMENTS 
Sub-section (1) of Section 31 provides that any person against whom a written instrument is void or voidable, 
and who has reasonable apprehension that such instrument, if left outstanding may cause him serious injury, 
may sue to have it adjudged void or voidable, and the Court may in its discretion, so adjudge it and order it to 
be delivered up and cancelled. Sub-section (2) lays down that if the instrument has been registered under 
the Indian Registration Act, 1908, the Court shall also send a copy of its decree to the officer in whose office 
the instrument has been so registered; and such officer shall note on the copy of the instrument contained in 
his books the fact of its cancellation. 
The relief of cancellation of instruments is founded upon the administration of protective justice which is 
                                                                       Lesson 21        Specific Relief Act, 1963 545 
technically known as “Quia time”. It is based upon the administration of protective justice for fear that the 
instrument may be vexatiously, or injuriously used by the defendant against the plaintiff when the evidence to 
impeach it may be lost or that it may throw a cloud of suspicion over the title or interest (Jekadula v. Bai Jini, 
39 B T R.,1072). 
Relief of cancellation under Section 31 would be available when (i) an instrument is void or voidable against 
the plaintiff; (ii) where the plaintiff may apprehend serious injury if the instrument is left outstanding and (iii) 
where it is proper under the circumstances of the case to grant the relief. 
Illustrations 
(a) A, the owner of a ship, by fraudulently representing her to be seaworthy, induces B, an underwriter, to 
insure her. B may obtain the cancellation of the policy.  
(b) A agrees to sell and deliver a ship to B, to be paid for by B’s acceptance of four bills of exchange, for 
sums amounting to Rs. 30,000, to be drawn by A on B. The bills are drawn and accepted, but the ship is not 
delivered according to the agreement. A sues B on one of the bills. B may obtain the cancellation of all the 
bills (Anglo Danubian Co. v. Rogerson (1867) L.R. 4 Eq. 3). 
Section 32 lays down that where an instrument is evidence of different rights or different obligations, the 
Court may, in proper case, cancel it in part and allow it to stand for the residue. The Court is not bound to 
cancel the whole of the instrument but may, in its discretion, when necessary, cancel it in part and allow rest 
of it to stand. 
A executes a deed of mortgage in favour of B. A gets back the deed from B by fraud and endorses on it a 
receipt for Rs. 1,200 purporting to be signed by B. B’s signature is forged. B is entitled to have the 
endorsement cancelled, leaving the deed to stand in other respects (Ram Chandar v. Ganga Saran, (1917) 
39 All. 103). 
Section 33(1) provides that on adjudging the cancellation of an instrument, the Court may require the party to 
whom such relief is granted, to restore, so far as may be, any benefit which he may have received from the 
other party and to make any compensation to him which justice may require. The provisions of this Section 
are almost similar to the provisions of Section 30 of this Act. Under both the Sections, the plaintiff must make 
such compensation to the defendant as the justice may require. 
DECLARATORY DECREES 
A declaratory decree is a decree whereby any right as to any property or the legal character of a person is 
judicially ascertained.  
The Supreme Court in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Mangilal Sharma, 1997 (7) SCALE 743, held that a 
declaratory decree merely declares the right of the decreehoder vis-a-vis the judgement debtor and does not 
in terms direct the judgement debtor to do or refrain from doing any particular act or thing. It cannot be 
executed as it only declares the rights of the decree-holder qua the judgement debtor and does not, in terms, 
direct him to do or refrain from doing any particular act or thing. 
Section 34 lays down that any person entitled to any legal character, or to any right as to any property, may 
institute a suit against any person denying, or interested to deny, his title to such character or right, and the 
Court may in its discretion make therein a declaration that he is so entitled and the plaintiff need not in such 
suit ask for any further relief provided that no Court shall make any such declaration where the plaintiff, being 
able to seek further relief than a mere declaration of title, omits to do so. The explanation provides that a 
trustee of property is a “person interested to deny” a title adverse to the title of someone who is not in 
EP-EBCL 
546 
existence, and for whom, if in existence, he would be a trustee. 
The object of declaratory decree is to remove doubt by having legal status of any rights declared by the 
Court, and to perpetuate and strengthen testimony regarding title of the plaintiff and protect it from adverse 
attacks. One of the objects of the legislature was to allow the right to enjoy the property rightfully belonging to 
the plaintiff. In case of declaratory decree, neither specific performance nor any compensation is awarded 
but only a declaration of the rights of the parties is made without any consequential relief being granted. The 
declaration does not confer any new rights upon the plaintiff but it merely declares what he had before. It 
only clears the mist that has gathered round the plaintiff’s title or status. The Court is being asked to put an 
end to the dispute and uncertainty by determining the legal character in issue. By that way the property may 
be put to better use, enjoyment and improvement. To maintain a suit under this Section following conditions 
must be fulfilled: 
 
(a) the plaintiff must be a person entitled to any legal character or to any right as to any property; 
 
(b) the defendant must be a person denying or interested to deny the plaintiff’s title to such legal 
character or, right; 
 
(c) The declaration issued for must be a declaration that the plaintiff is entitled to a legal character or to 
a right to property; and 
 
(d) where the plaintiff is able to seek further relief than a mere declaration he must seek such relief. 
Illustration 
A is properly in possession of certain lands. The inhabitants of a neighbouring village claim a right of way 
across the land. A may use for a declaration that they are not entitled to the right so claimed. 
The relief by way of declaration is purely discretionary. Instances of legal characters are — 
 
(1) Divorce on the ground of impotency 
 
(2) Legal character by marriage 
 
(3) Legitimacy or illegitimacy 
 
(4) Status of an adopted son 
 
(5) Priest of temple 
Effect of Declaration 
Section 35 lays down that a declaration is binding only on the parties to the suit, persons claiming through 
them respectively, and where any of the parties are trustees, on the persons for whom, if in existence at the 
date of the declaration, such parties would be trustees. 
Such a declaration is not judgement in rem and as such it cannot bind strangers. 
Illustration 
A, a Hindu, in a suit to which B, his alleged wife is the defendant’s seeks a declaration that his marriage was 
duly solemnised and prays for an order of restitution of conjugal rights. The Court makes the declaration and 
order of restitution of conjugal rights. C, a third-party claiming that B is his wife, sues A for the recovery of B. 
The declaration made in the former suit is not binding upon C. 
                                                                       Lesson 21        Specific Relief Act, 1963 547

Part III of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 grants specific relief called Preventive Relief i.e., preventing a party 
from doing that which he is under an obligation not to do. Preventive relief is granted at the discretion of the 
court by way of an injunction. 
An injunction is a specific order of the Court forbidding the commission of a wrong threatened or the 
continuance of a wrongful course of action already begun, or in some cases (when it is called a ‘mandatory 
injunction’) commanding active restitution of the former state of things. 
Lord Halsbury defines injunction as “a judicial process whereby a party is ordered to refrain from doing or to 
do a particular act or thing”. 
The main difference between an injunction and specific performance is that the remedy in case of an 
injunction is generally directed to prevent the violation of a negative act and therefore deals not only with 
contracts but also with torts and many other subjects of purely equitable one, whereas specific performance 
is directed to compelling performance of an active duty. 
It is known as a “judicial process by which one, who has invaded or is threatening to invade the rights (legal 
or equitable) of another is restrained from continuing or commencing such wrongful act. Injunction is the 
most ordinary form of preventive relief. For the effective administration of justice, this power to prevent and to 
restrain is absolutely necessary. 
Characteristics of an injunction 
An injunction has three characteristic features; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If the wrongful act has already taken place, the injunction prevents its repetition. If it is merely threatened, the 
threat is prevented from being executed. 
Temporary and perpetual injunctions 
Section 36 states that preventive relief is granted at the discretion of the Court by injunction, temporary or 
perpetual. 
The temporary injunctions are granted under Order 39 Rules 1-2 of the Civil Procedure Code while perpetual 
injunctions are dealt within Section 38 of the Specific Relief Act. 
The temporary injunction may be dissolved at any time under Civil Procedure Code by the defendant 
EP-EBCL 
548 
showing specific cause to the satisfaction of the Court against the order granting the injunction, or it 
automatically terminate with the disposal of the suit. The general principles governing temporary and 
permanent injunctions are mainly the same except that a temporary injunction is granted before the plaintiff 
establishes his case at the trial. 
Sub-section (1) of Section 37 lays down that temporary injunctions are such as are to continue until a 
specified time, or until the further order of the Court and they may be granted at any stage of a suit, and are 
regulated by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. 
Sub-section (2) states that a perpetual injunction can only be granted by the decree made at the hearing and 
upon the merits of the suit; the defendant is thereby perpetually enjoined from the assertion of right, or from 
the commission of an act, which would be contrary to the rights of the Plaintiff. It may be pointed out that: 
 
(i) While Section 37(1) of the Act gives the meaning of a perpetual injunction, Sections 37 to 62 lay 
down the principles according to which the perpetual injunction would be granted. 
 
(ii) The cases in which the perpetual injunction may be granted are of two classes. The object is to 
prevent the breach of an obligation existing in favour of the applicant, but such obligation may either 
arise out of a contract or otherwise. In case of contractual agreement principles governing specific 
performance will apply and in other cases, the injunction would be granted if the plaintiff can show 
that the defendant has a legal duty or obligation towards him and that by the non-performance of 
such duty the right to enjoyment of property has been materially affected. Such cases are where the 
defendant is trustee of the property of the plaintiff or where the injunction is necessary to prevent 
multiplicity of judicial proceedings, etc. 
Section 38 deals with granting of perpetual injunction. Sub-section (1) states that subject to the other 
provisions contained in or referred to by this chapter, a perpetual injunction may be granted to the plaintiff to 
prevent the breach of an obligation existing in his favour whether express or by implication. 
Sub-section (2) provides that when any such obligation arises from contract, the Court shall be guided by the 
rules and provisions contained in Chapter II, i.e., the chapter on specific performance of contracts. Sub-
section (3) lays down that when the defendant invades or threatens to invade the plaintiff’s right to, or 
enjoyment of property, the Court may grant a perpetual injunction in the following cases, namely: (a) where 
the defendant is a trustee of the property for the plaintiff; (b) where there exists no standard for ascertaining 
the actual damage caused, or likely to be caused by the invasion; (c) where the invasion is such that 
compensation in money would not afford adequate relief; (d) where the injunction is necessary to prevent a 
multiplicity of judicial proceedings. 
Difference between the remedies of specific performance and injunction  
Specific performance is decreed to compel the performance of an active duty, while injunction is decreed to 
prevent the violation of a negative duty. Normally, the former deals with contracts, while the latter with torts and 
other subjects of equitable nature. If a contract is positive in its nature, it calls for the relief of specific 
performance, on the other hand, if it is negative in its nature, it calls for relief of injunction. 
The principle governing the award of injunction as a mode of enforcement of contracts is similar to that of 
specific performance. This is clearly borne out by Section (38)2 of the Act. Thus, the enforcement of a 
contract is governed by both specific relief and injunction. “The jurisdiction of equity to grant such injunction 
is substantially coexistent with its jurisdiction to compel a specific performance”. But still their fields of 
operation are separate from each other. While a promise to do is enforced by specific performance, a 
promise to forbear is enforced by injunction. Section 41(e) further provides that contract which will not be 
                                                                       Lesson 21        Specific Relief Act, 1963 549 
affirmatively enforced by a decree of specific performance, will not be negatively enforced by issuing an 
injunction. The only exception to this rule is found in Section 42. 
Mandatory injunction 
Section 39 dealing with mandatory injunctions states that when to prevent the breach of an obligation, it is 
necessary to compel the performance of certain acts which the Court is capable of enforcing, the Court may 
in its discretion grant an injunction to prevent the breach complained of, and also to compel performance of 
the requisite acts. For example, A builds a house with eaves projecting over B’s land, B may sue for an 
injunction to pull down so much of the eaves as so projecting over his land. 
According to Section 40, the plaintiff in a suit for perpetual injunction under Section 38 or mandatory 
injunction under Section 39, may claim damages either in addition to, or in substitution for such injunction 
and the Court, may, if it thinks fit, award such damages. 
Injunction when refused 
Section 41 gives a list of cases in which a perpetual injunction cannot be granted. It says that an injunction 
cannot be granted —  
 
(a) to restrain any person from prosecuting a judicial proceeding pending at the institution of the suit in 
which the injunction is sought, unless such restraint is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of 
proceedings; 
 
(b) to restrain any person from instituting or prosecuting any proceeding in a Court not subordinate to 
that from which the injunction is sought; 
 
(c) to restrain any person from applying to any legislative body; 
 
(d) to restrain any person from instituting or prosecuting any proceeding in a criminal matter; 
 
(e) to prevent the breach of a contract the performance of which would not be specifically enforced; 
 
(f) to prevent on the ground of nuisance, an act of which it is not reasonably clear that it will be 
nuisance; 
 
(g) to prevent a continuing breach in which the plaintiff has acquiesced; 
 
(h) when equally efficacious relief can certainly be obtained by any other usual mode of proceeding 
except in case of breach of trust; 
 
(i) when the conduct of the plaintiff or his agents has been such as to disentitle him to the assistance 
of the Court; 
 
(j) when the plaintiff has no interest in the matter. 
It may be noted that this relief also is a discretionary remedy. It may be refused even if the case is not 
covered by Section 41. 
Injunction to perform negative agreement 
Section 42 provides that notwithstanding anything contained in clause (e) of Section 41, where a contract 
comprises an affirmative agreement to do a certain act, coupled with negative agreement, express or 
implied, not to do a certain act, the circumstance that the Court is unable to compel specific performance of 
the affirmative agreement shall not preclude it from granting an injunction to perform the negative agreement, 
EP-EBCL 
550 
provided that the plaintiff has not failed to perform the contract so far as it is binding on him. 
This Section is based upon an English case viz., Lumley v. Wagner (21) L.J. CH. 898. In this case Miss W, a 
singer agreed to sing at L’s theatre for a certain period and not to sing anywhere else during that period. 
Afterwards, she entered into a contract to sing at another theatre and refused to perform her contract with L. 
The Court refused to enforce her positive agreement to sing at L’s theatre (by specific performance) but 
granted an injunction restraining her from singing at any other theatre thereby preventing breach of the 
negative part of the agreement though the positive part of it, being a contract for the personal service, could 
not be specifically enforced. 
Conditions necessary for the applicability of this Section are: 
 
(1) The contract should comprise of two agreements, one affirmative and another negative. 
 
(2) Both the agreements must be divisible. 
 
(3) The negative agreement must relate to a specific act. 
 
(4) The Court should be unable to compel specific performance of the affirmative agreement. 
 
(5) The plaintiff must not have failed to perform the contract, so far as it is binding upon him. 
A negative stipulation may be express or implied. An express negative stipulation in one where the negative 
stipulation is put expressly. The Section does not say that every affirmative contract includes by necessary 
implication a negative agreement to refrain from doing certain things. It is therefore a question of 
interpretation in each case to find whether a particular contract can be said to have a negative stipulation, 
express or implied, contained in it, e.g., the mere use of word “exclusively” does not imply a negative 
stipulation to refrain from service of other people. 
The provisions of this Section are based on the equitable principle that “he who seeks equity must do equity”. 
The principle as laid down in Section 42 was followed in the cases of Burn Mcdonald (1907) 36 Cal 354; 
Metropolitan Electric Supply v. Ginder, (1901) 2 Ch. 799; Subba Naidu v. Hari Badshah, (13 M.L.J. 13); and 
Madras Rly Co. v. Rust, (1891) 14 Mad 18. 
LESSON ROUND-UP 
• Under the Specific Relief Act, 1963 only a party to the contract can get its specific performance. The 
section gives the list of persons who can sue for specific performance of a contract. The general principle is 
that in a suit for specific performance of a contract, all the parties to the contract should be parties to the 
suit and no one else. 
• The contracts which cannot be specifically enforced are a contract for the non-performance of which 
compensation in money is an adequate relief; a contract which runs into such minute and numerous details 
that the Court cannot enforce specific performance of its material terms or which is dependant upon the 
personal qualification or volition of the parties or a contract from its nature is such that the Court cannot 
enforce specific performance. 
• The contracts which cannot be specifically enforced are a contract which is in its nature determinable; a 
contract, the performance of which involves the performance of a continuous duty which the court cannot 
supervise. 
• The very foundation of specific performance of a contract is that an award for damages does not afford the 
aggrieved party a complete remedy. If in the opinion of the Court damages will be an adequate remedy, 
specific performance of the contract cannot be decreed. 
                                                                       Lesson 21        Specific Relief Act, 1963 551 
• An injunction cannot be granted under Specific Relief Act to restrain any person from prosecuting a judicial 
proceeding pending at the institution of the suit in which the injunction is sought, unless such restraint is 
necessary to prevent a multiplicity of proceedings; to restrain any person from instituting or prosecuting any 
proceeding in a Court not subordinate to that from which the injunction is sought.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Sale of Goods Act is one of very old mercantile law. 
Sale of Goods is one of the special types  of  
contract.  Initially, this was  part  of  Indian Contract 
Act  itself.  Later, this was deleted  in  Contract Act, 
and separate Sale of Goods Act was passed in 
1930. 
Sale of Goods Act is complimentary to Contract Act. 
Basic provisions of Contract Act apply to contract of 
Sale of Goods Act also.  Basic requirements of 
contract i.e. 
 
Offer 
and 
acceptance, 
legally 
enforceable agreement, mutual consent, parties 
competent to contract; free consent, lawful object, 
consideration etc. apply to contract of Sale of Goods 
Act also. 
This lesson is to be taught after the students have  
been  made  familiar  with  the  general principles of 
contract in which the emphasis is on  understanding  
and  appreciating  the  basic essentials  of  a  valid  
contract  and  on  the existence of contractual 
relationship in various instances.  In  today’s  era,  
the  need  for awareness  of  buyers  and  sellers  
rights  is  of utmost importance. In the backdrop of 
this and Contract Act, Sales of Goods Act is taught 
here to let the buyers beware and sellers to comply 
the requisite law in better and spirit. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Every sale has five basic obstacles: no need, no money, no hurry, no desire, no trust.

LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL 
554 
The law relating to sale of goods is contained in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. It has to be read as part of the 
Indian Contract Act, 1872 [Sections 2(5) and (3)]. 
Contract of Sale of Goods 
According to Section 4, a contract of sale of goods is a contract whereby the seller: 
 
(i) transfers or agrees to transfer the property in goods, 
 
(ii) to the buyer, 
 
(iii) for a money consideration called the price. 
It shows that the expression “contract of sale” includes both a sale where the seller transfers the ownership 
of the goods to the buyer, and an agreement to sell where the ownership of goods is to be transferred at a 
future time or subject to some conditions to be fulfilled later on. 
The following are thus the essentials of a contract of sale of goods: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(i) Bilateral contract: It is a bilateral contract because the property in goods has to pass from one party 
to another. A person cannot buy the goods himself. 
 
(ii) Transfer of property: The object of a contract of sale must be the transfer of property (meaning 
ownership) in goods from one person to another. 
 
(iii) Goods: The subject matter must be some goods. 
 
(iv) Price or money consideration: The goods must be sold for some price, where the goods are 
exchanged for goods it is barter, not sale. 
 
(v) All essential elements of a valid contract must be present in a contract of sale. 
Distinction between Sale and Agreement to Sell 
The following points will bring out the distinction between sale and an agreement to sell: 
 
(a) In a sale, the property in the goods sold passes to the buyer at the time of contract so that he 
                                                                       Lesson 22        Sale of Goods Act, 1930 
555 
becomes the owner of the goods. In an agreement to sell, the ownership does not pass to the buyer 
at the time of the contract, but it passes only when it becomes sale on the expiry of certain time or 
the fulfilment of some conditions subject to which the property in the goods is to be transferred. 
 
(b) An agreement to sell is an executory contract, a sale is an executed contract. 
 
(c) An agreement to sell is a contract pure and simple, but a sale is contract plus conveyance. 
 
(d) If there is an agreement to sell and the goods are destroyed by accident, the loss falls on the seller. 
In a sale, the loss falls on the buyer, even though the goods are with the seller. 
 
(e) If there is an agreement to sell and the seller commits a breach, the buyer has only a personal 
remedy against the seller, namely, a claim for damages. But if there has been a sale, and the seller 
commits a breach by refusing to deliver the goods, the buyer has not only a personal remedy 
against him but also the other remedies which an owner has in respect of goods themselves such 
as a suit for conversion or detenue, etc. 
Sale and Bailment 
A “bailment” is a transaction under which goods are delivered by one person (the bailor) to another (the 
bailee) for some purpose, upon a contract that they be returned or disposed of as directed after the purpose 
is accomplished (Section 148 of the Indian Contact Act, 1872). 
The property in the goods is not intended to and does not pass on delivery though it may sometimes be the 
intention of the parties that it should pass in due course. But where goods are delivered to another on terms 
which indicate that the property is to pass at once the contract must be one of sale and not bailment. 
Sale and Contract for Work and Labour 
The distinction between a “sale” and a “contract for work and labour” becomes important when question of 
passing of property arises for consideration. 
However, these two are difficult to distinguish. The test generally applied is that if as a result of the contract, 
property in an article is transferred to one who had no property therein previously for a money consideration, 
it is a sale, where it is otherwise it is a contract for work and labour. 
Sale and Hire Purchase Agreement 
“Sale”, is a contract by which property in goods passes from the seller to the buyer for a price. 
A “hire purchase agreement” is basically a contract of hire, but in addition, it gives the hirer an option to 
purchase the goods at the end of the hiring period. Consequently, until the final payment, the hirer is merely 
a bailee of goods and ownership remains vested in the bailor. Under such a contract, the owner of goods 
delivers the goods to person who agrees to pay certain stipulated periodical payments as hire charges. 
Though the possession is with the hirer, the ownership of the goods remains with the original owner. 
The essence of hire purchase agreement is that there is no agreement to buy, but only an option is given to 
the hirer to buy by paying all the instalments or put an end to the hiring and return the goods to the owner, at 
any time before the exercise of the option. 
Since the hirer does not become owner of the goods until he has exercised his option to buy, he cannot pass 
any title even to an innocent and bona fide purchaser. The transaction of hire-purchase protects the owner of 
the goods against the insolvency of the buyer, for if the buyer becomes insolvent or fails to pay the 
instalments, he can take back the goods as owner. And if the hirer declines to take delivery of the goods, the 
remedy of the owner will be damages for non-hiring and not for rent for the period agreed. 
EP-EBCL 
556 
It is important to note the difference between a hire purchase agreement and mere payment of the price by 
instalments because, the latter is a sale, only the payment of price is to be made by instalments. 
The distinction between the two is very important because, in a hire-purchase agreement the risk of loss or 
deterioration of the goods hired lies with the owner and the hirer will be absolved of any responsibility 
therefor, if he has taken reasonable care to protect the same as a bailee. But it is otherwise in the case of a 
sale where the price is to be paid in instalments. 
Subject matter of Contract of Sale of Goods 
 
Goods 
The subject matter of the contract of sale is essentially goods. According to Section 2(7) of the Sale of 
Goods Act, “goods” means every kind of movable property other than actionable claims and money and 
includes stock and shares, growing crops, grass and things attached to or forming part of the land which are 
agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract of sale. 
Actionable claims and money are not goods and cannot be brought and sold under this Act. Money means 
current money, i.e., the recognised currency in circulation in the country, but not old and rare coins which 
may be treated as goods. An actionable claim is what a person cannot make a present use of or enjoy, but 
what can be recovered by him by means of a suit or an action. Thus, a debt due to a man from another is an 
actionable claim and cannot be sold as goods, although it can be assigned. Under the provisions of the 
Transfer of Property Act, 1882, goodwill, trade marks, copyrights, patents are all goods, so is a ship. As 
regards water, gas, electricity, it is doubtful whether they are goods (Rash Behari v. Emperor, (1936) 41 
C.W.N. 225; M.B. Electric Supply Co. Ltd. v. State of Rajasthan, AIR (1973) Raj. 132). 
Goods may be (a) existing, (b) future, or (c) contingent. The existing goods may be (i) specific or generic, (ii) 
ascertained or unascertained. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Existing Goods 
Existing goods are goods which are either owned or possessed by the seller at the time of the contract. Sale 
of goods possessed but not owned by the seller would be by an agent or pledgee. 
                                                                       Lesson 22        Sale of Goods Act, 1930 
557 
Existing goods are specific goods which are identified and agreed upon at the time of the contract of sale. 
Ascertained goods are either specific goods at the time of the contract or are ascertained or identified to the 
contract later on i.e. made specific. 
Generic or unascertained goods are goods which are not specifically identified but are indicated by 
description. If a merchant agrees to supply a radio set from his stock of radio sets, it is a contract of sale of 
unascertained goods because it is not known which set will be delivered. As soon as a particular set is 
separated or identified for delivery and the buyer has notice of it, the goods are ascertained and become 
specific goods. 
Future Goods 
Future goods are goods to be manufactured or produced or acquired by the seller after the making of the 
contract of sale. A agrees to sell all the mangoes which will be produced in his garden next season. This is 
an agreement for the sale of future goods. [Section 2(6)] 
Contingent Goods 
Where there is a contract for the sale of goods, the acquisition of which by the seller depends upon a 
contingency which may or may not happen—such goods are known as contingent goods. Contingent goods 
fall in the class of future goods. A agrees to sell a certain TV set provided he is able to get it from its present 
owner. This is an agreement to sell contingent goods. In such a case, if the contingency does not happen for 
no fault of the seller, he will not be liable for damages. 
Actual sale can take place only of specific goods and property in goods passes from the seller to buyer at the 
time of the contract, provided the goods are in a deliverable state and the contract is unconditional. 
There can be an agreement to sell only in respect of future or contingent goods. 
Effect of Perishing of Goods 
In a contract of sale of goods, the goods may perish before sale is complete. Such a stage may arise in the 
following cases: 
(i) Goods perishing before making a contract  
Where in a contract of sale of specific goods, the goods without the knowledge of the seller have, at the time 
of making the contract perished or become so damaged as no longer to answer to their description in the 
contract, the contract is void. This is based on the rule that mutual mistake of fact essential to the contract 
renders the contract void. (Section 7) 
If the seller was aware of the destruction and still entered into the contract, he is estopped from disputing the 
contract. Moreover, perishing of goods not only includes loss by theft but also where the goods have lost 
their commercial value. 
(ii) Goods perishing after agreement to sell  
Where there is an agreement to sell specific goods, and subsequently the goods without any fault of any 
party perish or are so damaged as no longer to answer to their description in the agreement before the risk 
passes to the buyer, the agreement is thereby avoided. The provision applies only to sale of specific goods. 
If the sale is of unascertained goods, the perishing of the whole quantity of such goods in the possession of 
the seller will not relieve him of his obligation to deliver. (Section 8) 
Price 
No sale can take place without a price. Thus, if there is no valuable consideration to support a voluntary 
EP-EBCL 
558 
surrender of goods by the real owner to another person, the transaction is a gift, and is not governed by the 
Sale of Goods Act. Therefore, price, which is money consideration for the sale of goods, constitutes the 
essence for a contract of sale. It may be money actually paid or promised to be paid. If a consideration other 
than money is to be given, it is not a sale. 
Modes of Fixing Price (Sections 9 and 10) 
The price may be fixed: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Where the contract states that the price is to be fixed by a third-party and such third-party fails to do so, the 
contract is void. But if the buyer has already taken the benefit of the goods, he must pay a reasonable price 
for them. If the third-party’s failure to fix the price is due to the fault of the seller or buyer, then that party is 
liable for an action for damages. 
Where nothing is said by the parties regarding price, the buyer must pay a reasonable price. What is a 
reasonable price is a question of fact dependent upon the circumstances of each particular case. Generally, 
the market price would be a reasonable price. 
Conditions and Warranties (Sections 12-17) 
The parties are at liberty to enter into a contract with any terms they please. As a rule, before a contract of 
sale is concluded, certain statements are made by the parties to each other. The statement may amount to a 
stipulation, forming part of the contract or a mere expression of opinion which is not part of the contract. If it 
is a statement by the seller on the reliance of which the buyer makes the contract, it will amount to a 
stipulation. If it is a mere commendation by the seller of his goods it does not amount to a stipulation and 
does not give the right of action. 
The stipulation may either be a condition or a warranty. Section 12 draws a clear distinction between a 
condition and a warranty. Whether a stipulation is a condition or only a warranty is a matter of substance rather 
than the form of the words used. A stipulation may be a condition though called a warranty and vice versa. 
                                                                       Lesson 22        Sale of Goods Act, 1930 
559 
Conditions 
If the stipulation forms the very basis of the contract or is essential to the main purpose of the contract, it is a 
condition. The breach of the condition gives the aggrieved party a right to treat the contract as repudiated. 
Thus, if the seller fails to fulfil a condition, the buyer may treat the contract as repudiated, refuse the goods 
and, if he has already paid for them, recover the price. He can also claim damages for the breach of contract. 
Warranties 
If the stipulation is collateral to the main purpose of the contract, i.e., is a subsidiary promise, it is a warranty. 
The effect of a breach of a warranty is that the aggrieved party cannot repudiate the contract but can only 
claim damages. Thus, if the seller does not fulfil a warranty, the buyer must accept the goods and claim 
damages for breach of warranty. 
Section 11 states that the stipulation as to time of payment are not to be deemed conditions (and hence not 
to be of the essence of a contract of sale) unless such an intention appears from the contract. Whether any 
other stipulation as to time (e.g., time of delivery) is of the essence of the contract or not depends on the 
terms of the contract. 
When condition sinks to the level of warranty 
In some cases a condition sinks or descends to the level of a warranty. The first two cases depend upon the 
will of the buyer, but the third is compulsory and acts as estoppel against him. 
 
(a) A condition will become a warranty where the buyer waives the condition; or 
 
(b) A condition will sink to the level of a warranty where the buyer treats the breach of condition as a 
breach of warranty; or 
 
(c) Where the contract is indivisible and the buyer has accepted the goods or part thereof, the breach 
of condition can only be treated as breach of warranty. The buyer can only claim damages and 
cannot reject the goods or treat the contract as repudiated. 
Sometimes the seller may be excused by law from fulfilling any condition or warranty and the buyer will not 
then have a remedy in damages. 
Implied Warranties/Conditions 
Even where no definite representations have been made, the law implies certain representations as having 
been made which may be warranties or conditions. An express warranty or condition does not negative an 
implied warranty or condition unless inconsistent therewith. 
There are two implied warranties: 
Implied Warranties [Section 14(b), 14(c) and 16(3)] 
 
(a) Implied warranty of quiet possession: If the circumstances of the contract are such as there is an 
implied warranty that the buyer shall have and enjoy quiet possession of the goods. 
 
(b) Implied warranty against encumbrances: There is a further warranty that the goods are not subject 
to any right in favour of a third-party, or the buyer’s possession shall not be disturbed by reason of 
the existence of encumbrances. This means that if the buyer is required to, and does discharge the 
amount of the encumbrance, there is breach of warranty, and he is entitled to claim damages from 
the seller. 
EP-EBCL

Implied Conditions [Sections 14(a), 15(1), (2), 16(1) and Proviso 16(2), and Proviso 16(3) and 
12(b) and 12(c)]. 
Different implied conditions apply under different types of contracts of sale of goods, such as sale by 
description, or sale by sample, or sale by description as well as sample. The condition, as to title to goods 
applies to all types of contracts, subject to that there is apparently no other intention. 
Implied Conditions as to title 
There is an implied condition that the seller, in an actual sale, has the right to sell the goods, and, in an 
agreement to sell, he will have a right to sell the goods at the time when property is to pass. As a result, if the 
title of the seller turns out to be defective, the buyer is entitled to reject the goods and can recover the full price 
paid by him. 
In Rowland v. Divall (1923) 2 K.B. 500, ‘A’ had bought a second hand motor car from ‘B’ and paid for it. After 
he had used it for six months, he was deprived of it because the seller had no title to it. It was held that ‘B’ 
had broken the condition as to title and ‘A’ was therefore, entitled to recover the purchase money from ‘B’ 
Implied conditions under a sale by description 
In a sale by description there are the following implied conditions: 
(a) Goods must correspond with description: It is provided under Section 15 of the Act that when there is 
a sale of goods by description, there is an implied condition that the goods shall correspond with description. 
In a sale by description, the buyer relies for his information on the description of the goods given by the 
seller, e.g. in the contract or in the preliminary negotiations. 
Where ‘A’ buys goods which he has not seen, it must be sale by description, e.g., where he buys a ‘new Fiat 
car’ from ‘B’ and the car is not new, he can reject the car. 
Even if the buyer has seen the goods, the goods must be in accordance with the description (Beale v. Taylor 
(1967) All E.R. 253). 
(b) Goods must also be of merchantable quality: If they are bought by description from dealer of goods of 
that description. [Section 16(2)] 
Merchantable quality means that the goods must be such as would be acceptable to a reasonable person, 
having regard to prevailing conditions. They are not merchantable if they have defects which make them unfit 
for ordinary use, or are such that a reasonable person knowing of their condition would not buy them. ‘P’ 
bought black yarn from ‘D’ and, when delivered, found it damaged by the white ants. The condition of 
merchantability was broken. 
But, if the buyer has examined the goods, there is no implied condition as regards defects which such 
examination ought to have revealed. If, however, examination by the buyer does not reveal the defect and he 
approves and accepts the goods, but when put to work, the goods are found to be defective, there is a 
breach of condition of merchantable quality. 
The buyer is given a right to examine the goods before accepting them. But a mere opportunity without an 
actual examination, however, cursory, would not suffice to deprive him of this right. 
(c) Condition as to wholesomeness: The provisions, (i.e., eatables) supplied must not only answer the 
description, but they must also be merchantable and wholesome or sound. ‘F’ bought milk from ‘A’ and the milk 
contained typhoid germs. ‘F’s wife became infected and died. ‘A’ was liable for damages. Again, ‘C’ bought a 
                                                                       Lesson 22        Sale of Goods Act, 1930 
561 
bun at ‘M’s bakery, and broke one of his teeth by biting on a stone present in the bun. ‘M’ was held liable. 
(d) Condition as to quality or fitness for a particular purpose: Ordinarily, in a contract of sale, there is no 
implied warranty or condition as to the quality or fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied. 
But there is an implied condition that the goods are reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are required 
if: 
 
(i) the buyer expressly or by implication makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the 
goods are required, so as to show that he relies on the seller’s skill and judgement, and 
 
(ii) the goods are of a description which it is in the course of the seller’s business to supply (whether he 
is the manufacturer or producer or not). There is no such condition if the goods are bought under a 
patent or trade name. 
In Priest v. Last (1903) 2 K.B. 148, a hot water bottle was bought by the plaintiff, a draper, who could not be 
expected to have special skill knowledge with regard to hot water bottles, from a chemist, who sold such 
articles stating that the bottle will not stand boiling water but was intended to hold hot water. While being 
used by the plaintiff’s wife, the bottle bursted and injured her. Held, the seller was responsible for damages 
as the bottle was not fit for use as a hot water bottle. 
In Grant v. Australian Knitting Mills (1936) 70 MLJ 513, ‘G’ a doctor purchased woollen underpants from ‘M’ a 
retailer whose business was to sell goods of that description. After wearing the underpants, ‘G’ developed 
some skin diseases. Held, the goods were not fit for their only use and ‘G’ was entitled to avoid the contract 
and claim damages. 
Implied conditions under a sale by sample (Section 17) 
In a contract of sale by sample: 
 
(a) there is an implied condition that the bulk shall correspond with the sample in quality; 
 
(b) there is another implied condition that the buyer shall have a reasonable opportunity of comparing 
the bulk with the sample; 
 
(c) it is further an implied condition of merchantability, as regards latent or hidden defects in the goods 
which would not be apparent on reasonable examination of the sample. “Worsted coating” quality 
equal to sample was sold to tailors, the cloth was found to have a defect in the fixture rendering the 
same unfit for stitching into coats. The seller was held liable even though the same defect existed in 
the sample, which was examined. 
Implied conditions in sale by sample as well as by description 
In a sale by sample as well as by description, the goods supplied must correspond both with the samples as 
well as with the description. Thus, in Nichol v. Godts (1854) 158 E.R. 426, there was a sale of “foreign 
refined rape-oil having warranty only equal to sample”. The oil tendered was the same as the sample, but it 
was not “foreign refined rape-oil” having a mixture of it and other oil. It was held that the seller was liable, and 
the buyer could refuse to accept. 
IMPLIED WARRANTIES 
Implied warranties are those which the law presumes to have been incorporated in the contract of sale 
inspite of the fact that the parties have not expressly included them in a contract of sale. Subject to the 
EP-EBCL 
562 
contract to the contrary, following are the implied warranties in a contract of sale: 
 
(i) Warranty as to quiet possession: Section 14(b) of the Sale of Goods Act provides that there is an 
implied warranty that the buyer shall have and enjoy quiet possession of goods. If the buyer’s 
possession is disturbed by anyone having superior title than that of the seller, the buyer is entitled to 
hold the seller liable for breach of warranty. 
 
(ii) Warranty as to freedom from encumbrances: Section 14(c) states that in a contract of sale, there is 
an implied warranty that the goods shall be free from any charge or encumbrance in favour of any 
third party not declared or known to the buyer before or at the time when the contract is made. But if 
the buyer is aware of any encumbrance on the goods at the time of entering into the contract, he will 
not be entitled to any compensation from the seller for discharging the encumbrance. 
 
(iii) Warranty to disclose dangerous nature of goods: If the goods are inherently dangerous or likely to 
be dangerous and the buyer is ignorant of the danger, the seller must warn the buyer of the 
probable danger. 
 
(iv) Warranties implied by the custom or usage of trade: Section 16(3) provides that an implied warranty 
or condition as to quality or fitness for a particular purpose may be annexed by the usage of trade. 
Doctrine of Caveat Emptor 
The term “caveat emptor” is a Latin word which means “let the buyer beware”. This principle states that it is 
for the buyer to satisfy himself that the goods which he is purchasing are of the quality which he requires. If 
he buys goods for a particular purpose, he must satisfy himself that they are fit for that purpose. The doctrine 
of caveat emptor is embodied in Section 16 of the Act which states that “subject to the provisions of this Act 
and of any other law for the time being in force, there is no implied warranty or condition as to the quality or 
fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied under a contract of sale”. In simple words, it is not the 
seller’s duty to give to the buyer the goods which are fit for a suitable purpose of the buyer. If he makes a 
wrong selection, he cannot blame the seller if the goods turn out to be defective or do not serve his purpose. 
The principle was applied in the case of Ward v. Hobbs, (1878) 4 A.C. 13, where certain pigs were sold by 
auction and no warranty was given by seller in respect of any fault or error of description. The buyer paid the 
price for healthy pigs. But they were ill and all but one died of typhoid fever. They also infected some of the 
buyer’s own pigs. It was held that there was no implied condition or warranty that the pigs were of good 
health. It was the buyer’s duty to satisfy himself regarding the health of the pigs. 
Exceptions: Section 16 lays down the following exceptions to the doctrine of Caveat Emptor: 
 
(1) Where the seller makes a false representation and the buyer relies on it. 
 
(2) When the seller actively conceals a defect in the goods which is not visible on a reasonable 
examination of the same. 
 
(3) When the buyer, relying upon the skill and judgement of the seller, has expressly or impliedly 
communicated to him the purpose for which the goods are required. 
 
(4) Where goods are bought by description from a seller who deals in goods of that description. 
Passing of Property or Transfer of Ownership (Sections 18-20) 
The sole purpose of a sale is the transfer of ownership of goods from the seller to the buyer. It is important to 
know the precise moment of time at which the property in the goods passes from the seller to the buyer for 
the following reasons: 
 
(a) The general rule is that risk follows the ownership, whether the delivery has been made or not. If the 
                                                                       Lesson 22        Sale of Goods Act, 1930 
563 
goods are lost or damaged by accident or otherwise, then, subject to certain exceptions, the loss 
falls on the owner of the goods at the time they are lost or damaged. 
 
(b) When there is a danger of the goods being damaged by the action of third parties, it is generally the 
owner who can take action. 
 
(c) The rights of third parties may depend upon the passing of the property if the buyer resells the 
goods to a third-party, the third-party will only obtain a good title if the property in the goods has 
passed to the buyer before or at the time of the resale. Similarly, if the seller, in breach of his 
contract with the buyer, attempts to sell the goods to a third party in the goods, has not passed to 
the buyer, e.g., where there is only an agreement to sell. 
 
(d) In case of insolvency of either the seller or the buyer, it is necessary to know whether the goods can 
be taken over by the official assignee or the official receiver. It will depend upon whether the 
property in the goods was with the party adjudged insolvent. 
Thus in this context, ownership and possession are two distinct concepts and these two can at times remain 
separately with two different persons. 
Passing of property in specific goods 
In a sale of specific or ascertained goods, the property in them passes to the buyer as and when the parties 
intended to pass. The intention must be gathered from the terms of the contract, the conduct of the parties and 
the circumstances of the case. 
Unless a contrary intention appears, the following rules are applicable for ascertaining the intention of the 
parties: 
 
(a) Where there is an unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state, the 
property in the goods passes to the buyer when the contract is made. Deliverable state means such 
a state that the buyer would be bound to take delivery of the goods. The fact that the time of 
delivery or the time of payment is postponed does not prevent the property from passing at once. 
(Section 20) 
 
(b) Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods not in a deliverable state, i.e., the seller has 
to do something to the goods to put them in a deliverable state, the property does not pass until that 
thing is done and the buyer has notice of it. (Section 21) 
 
 A certain quantity of oil was brought. The oil was to be filled into casks by the seller and then taken 
away by the buyer. Some casks were filled in the presence of buyer but, before the remainder could 
be filled, a fire broke out and the entire quantity of oil was destroyed, Held, the buyer must bear the 
loss of the oil which was put into the casks (i.e., put in deliverable state) and the seller must bear 
the loss of the remainder (Rugg v. Minett (1809) 11 East 210). 
 
(c) Where there is a sale of specific goods in a deliverable state, but the seller is bound to weigh, 
measure, test or do something with reference to the goods for the purpose of ascertaining the price, 
the property to the goods for the purpose of ascertaining the price, does not pass until such act or 
thing is done and the buyer has notice of it. (Section 22) 
 
(d) When goods are delivered to the buyer “on approval” or “on sale of return” or other similar terms the 
property therein passes to the buyer: 
 
(i) when he signifies his approval or acceptance to the seller, or does any other act adopting the 
transaction; 
EP-EBCL 
564 
 
(ii) if he does not signify his approval or acceptance but retains the goods without giving notice of 
rejection, in such a case—(a) if a time has been fixed for the return of the goods, on the 
expiration of such time; and (b) if no time has been fixed, on the expiration of a reasonable time. 
Ownership in unascertained goods 
The property in unascertained or future goods does not pass until the goods are ascertained. 
Unascertained goods are goods defined by description only, for example, 100 quintals of wheat; and not 
goods identified and agreed upon when the contract is made. 
Unless a different intention appears, the following rules are applicable for ascertaining the intention of the 
parties in regard to passing of property in respect of such goods: 
 
(a) The property in unascertained or future goods sold by description passes to the buyer when goods 
of that description and in a deliverable state are unconditionally appropriated to the contract, either 
by the seller with the assent of the buyer or by the buyer with the assent of the seller. Such assent 
may be expressed or implied and may be given either before or after the appropriation is made. 
(Section 23) 
 
(b) If there is a sale of a quantity of goods out of a large quantity, for example, 50 quintals of rice out of 
a heap in B’s godown, the property will pass on the appropriation of the specified quantity by one 
party with the assent of the other. 
 
(c) Delivery by the seller of the goods to a carrier or other buyer for the purpose of transmission to the 
buyer in pursuance of the contact is an appropriation sufficient to pass the property in the goods. 
 
(d) The property in goods, whether specific or unascertained, does not pass if the seller reserves the 
right of disposal of the goods. Apart from an express reservation of the right of disposal, the seller is 
deemed to reserve the right of disposal in the following two cases: 
 
(i) where goods are shipped or delivered to a railway administration for carriage by railway and by 
the bill of lading or railway receipt, the goods are deliverable to the order of the seller or his 
agent. 
 
(ii) when the seller sends the bill of exchange for the price of the goods to the buyer for this acceptance, 
together with the bill of lading, the property in the goods does not pass to the buyer unless he 
accepts the bill of exchange. 
Passing of Risk (Section 26) 
The general rule is that goods remain at the seller’s risk until the ownership is transferred to the buyer. After 
the ownership has passed to the buyer, the goods are at the buyer’s risk whether the delivery has been 
made or not. For example, ‘A’ buys goods of ‘B’ and property has passed from ‘B’ to ‘A’; but the goods 
remain in ‘B’s warehouse and the price is unpaid. Before delivery, ‘B’s warehouse is burnt down for no fault 
of ‘B’ and the goods are destroyed. ‘A’ must pay ‘B’ the price of the goods, as he was the owner. The rule is 
resperit domino- the loss falls on the owner. 
But the parties may agree that risk will pass at the time different from the time when ownership passed. For 
example, the seller may agree to be responsible for the goods even after the ownership is passed to the 
buyer or vice versa. 
In Consolidated Coffee Ltd. v. Coffee Board, (1980 3 SCC 358), one of the terms adopted by coffee board 
for auction of coffee was the property in the coffee knocked down to a bidder would not pass until the 
                                                                       Lesson 22        Sale of Goods Act, 1930 
565 
payment of price and in the meantime the goods would remain with the seller but at the risk of the buyer, In 
such cases, risk and property passes on at different stages. 
In Multanmal Champalal v. Shah & Co., AIR (1970) Mysore 106, goods were despatched by the seller from 
Bombay to Bellary through a public carrier. According to the terms of the contract, the goods were to remain 
the property of the seller till the price was paid though the risk was to pass to the buyer when they were 
delivered to public carrier for despatch. When the goods were subsequently lost before the payment of the 
price (and the consequent to the passing of the property to the buyer), the Court held that the loss was to be 
borne by the buyer. 
It was further held in the same case that the buyer was at fault in delaying delivery unreasonably and 
therefore on that ground also he was liable for the loss, because such loss would not have arisen but for 
such delay. 
Thus, where delivery has been delayed through the fault of either the buyer or the seller, in such a case, the 
goods are at the risk of the party at fault as regards any loss which might not have occurred but for such 
fault. 
Transfer of Title by Person not the Owner (Section 27-30) 
The general rule is that only the owner of goods can sell the goods. Conversely, the sale of an article by a 
person who is not or who has not the authority of the owner, gives no title to the buyer. The rule is expressed 
by the maxim; “Nemo Dat Quod Non Habet” i.e. no one can pass a better title than he himself has. As 
applied to the sale of goods, the rule means that a seller of goods cannot give a better title to the buyer than 
he himself possess. Thus, even a bona fide buyer who buys stolen goods from a thief or from a transfree 
from such a thief can get no valid title to them, since the thief has no title, nor could he give one to any 
transferee. 
Example: 
 
1. A, the hirer of goods under a hire purchase agreement, sells them to B, then B, though a bona fide 
purchaser, does not acquire the property in the goods. At most he can acquire such an interest as 
the hirer had. 
 
2. A finds a ring of B and sells it to a third person who purchases it for value and in good faith. The true 
owner, i.e. B can recover from that person, for A having no title to the ring could pass none the 
better. 
Exception to the General Rule 
The Act while recognizing the general rule that no one can give a better title than he himself has, laid down 
important exceptions to it. Under the exceptions the buyer gets a better title to the goods than the seller 
himself. These exceptions are given below: 
 
(a) Sale by a mercantile agent: A buyer will get a good title if he buys in good faith from a mercantile 
agent who is in possession either of the goods or documents of title to the goods with the consent of 
the owner, and who sells the goods in the ordinary course of his business. 
 
(b) Sale by a co-owner: A buyer who buys in good faith from one of the several joint owners who is in 
sole possession of the goods with the permission of his co-owners will get good title to the goods. 
 
(c) Sale by a person in possession under a voidable contract: A buyer buys in good faith from a person 
in possession of goods under a contract which is voidable, but has not been rescinded at the time of 
the sale. 
EP-EBCL 
566 
 
(d) Sale by seller in possession after sale: Where a seller, after having sold the goods, continues or is 
in possession of the goods or of the documents of title to the goods and again sells them by himself 
or through his mercantile agent to a person who buys in good faith and without notice of the 
previous sale, such a buyer gets a good title to the goods. 
 
(e) Sale by buyer in possession: If a person has brought or agreed to buy goods obtains, with the 
seller’s consent, possession of the goods or of the documents of title to them, any sale by him or by 
his mercantile agent to a buyer who takes in good faith without notice of any lien or other claim of 
the original seller against the goods, will give a good title to the buyer. In any of the above cases, if 
the transfer is by way of pledge or pawn only, it will be valid as a pledge or pawn. 
 
(f) Estoppel: If the true owner stands by and allows an innocent buyer to pay over money to a third-
party, who professes to have the right to sell an article, the true owner will be estopped from 
denying the third-party’s right to sell. 
 
(g) Sale by an unpaid seller: Where an unpaid seller has exercised his right of lien or stoppage in 
transit and is in possession of the goods, he may resell them and the second buyer will get absolute 
right to the goods. 
 
(h) Sale by person under other laws: A pawnee, on default of the pawnee to repay, has a right to sell 
the goods, pawned and the buyer gets a good title to the goods. The finder of lost goods can also 
sell under certain circumstances. The Official Assignee or Official Receiver, Liquidator, Officers of 
Court selling under a decree, Executors, and Administrators, all these persons are not owners, but 
they can convey better title than they have. 
Performance of the Contract of Sale 
It is the duty of the seller and buyer that the contract is performed. The duty of the seller is to deliver the 
goods and that of the buyer is to accept the goods and pay for them in accordance with the contract of sale. 
Unless otherwise agreed, payment of the price and the delivery of the goods are concurrent conditions, i.e., 
they both take place at the same time as in a cash sale over a shop counter. 
Delivery (Sections 33-39) 
Delivery is the voluntary transfer of possession from one person to another. Delivery may be actual, 
constructive or symbolic. Actual or physical delivery takes place where the goods are handed over by the 
seller to the buyer or his agent authorised to take possession of the goods. Constructive delivery takes place 
when the person in possession of the goods acknowledges that he holds the goods on behalf of and at the 
disposal of the buyer. For example, where the seller, after having sold the goods, may hold them as bailee 
for the buyer, there is constructive delivery. Symbolic delivery is made by indicating or giving a symbol. Here 
the goods themselves are not delivered, but the “means of obtaining possession” of goods is delivered, e.g, 
by delivering the key of the warehouse where the goods are stored, bill of lading which will entitle the holder 
to receive the goods on the arrival of the ship. 
Rules as to delivery 
The following rules apply regarding delivery of goods: 
 
(a) Delivery should have the effect of putting the buyer in possession. 
 
(b) The seller must deliver the goods according to the contract. 
 
(c) The seller is to deliver the goods when the buyer applies for delivery; it is the duty of the buyer to 
                                                                       Lesson 22        Sale of Goods Act, 1930 
567 
claim delivery. 
 
(d) Where the goods at the time of the sale are in the possession of a third person, there will be 
delivery only when that person acknowledges to the buyer that he holds the goods on his behalf. 
 
(e) The seller should tender delivery so that the buyer can take the goods. It is no duty of the seller to 
send or carry the goods to the buyer unless the contract so provides. But the goods must be in a 
deliverable state at the time of delivery or tender of delivery. If by the contract the seller is bound to 
send the goods to the buyer, but no time is fixed, the seller is bound to send them within a 
reasonable time. 
 
(f) The place of delivery is usually stated in the contract. Where it is so stated, the goods must be 
delivered at the specified place during working hours on a working day. Where no place is 
mentioned, the goods are to be delivered at a place at which they happen to be at the time of the 
contract of sale and if not then in existence they are to be delivered at the place at which they are 
manufactured or produced. 
 
(g) The seller has to bear the cost of delivery unless the contract otherwise provides. While the cost of 
obtaining delivery is said to be of the buyer, the cost of the putting the goods into deliverable state 
must be borne by the seller. In other words, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, the 
expenses of and incidental to making delivery of the goods must be borne by the seller, the 
expenses of and incidental to receiving delivery must be borne by the buyer. 
 
(h) If the goods are to be delivered at a place other than where they are, the risk of deterioration in transit 
will, unless otherwise agreed, be borne by the buyer. 
 
(i) Unless otherwise agreed, the buyer is not bound to accept delivery in instalments. 
Acceptance of Goods by the Buyer 
Acceptance of the goods by the buyer takes place when the buyer: 
 
(a) intimates to the seller that he has accepted the goods; or 
 
(b) retains the goods, after the lapse of a reasonable time without intimating to the seller that he has 
rejected them; or 
 
(c) does any act on the goods which is inconsistent with the ownership of the seller, e.g., pledges or 
resells. If the seller sends the buyer a larger or smaller quantity of goods than ordered, the buyer 
may: 
 
(i) reject the whole; or 
 
(ii) accept the whole; or 
 
(ii) accept the quantity be ordered and reject the rest. 
If the seller delivers with the goods ordered, goods of a wrong description, the buyer may accept the goods 
ordered and reject the rest, or reject the whole. 
Where the buyer rightly rejects the goods, he is not bound to return the rejected goods to the seller. It is 
sufficient if he intimates the seller that he refuses to accept them. In that case, the seller has to remove them. 
Instalment Deliveries 
When there is a contract for the sale of goods to be delivered by stated instalments which are to be 
EP-EBCL 
568 
separately paid for, and either the buyer or the seller commits a breach of contract, it depends on the terms 
of the contract whether the breach is a repudiation of the whole contract or a severable breach merely giving 
right to claim for damages. 
Suits for Breach of Contract 
Where the property in the goods has passed to the buyer, the seller may sue him for the price. 
Where the price is payable on a certain day regardless of delivery, the seller may sue for the price, if it is not 
paid on that day, although the property in the goods has not passed. 
Where the buyer wrongfully neglects or refuses to accept the goods and pay for them, the seller may sue the 
buyer for damages for non-acceptance. 
Where the seller wrongfully neglects or refuses to deliver the goods to the buyer, the buyer may sue him for 
damages for non-delivery. 
Where there is a breach of warranty or where the buyer elects or is compelled to treat the breach of condition 
as a breach of warranty, the buyer cannot reject the goods. He can set breach of warranty in extinction or 
dimunition of the price payable by him and if loss suffered by him is more than the price he may sue for the 
damages. 
If the buyer has paid the price and the goods are not delivered, the buyer can sue the seller for the recovery 
of the amount paid. In appropriate cases the buyer can also get an order from the court that the specific 
goods ought to be delivered. 
Anticipatory Breach 
Where either party to a contract of sale repudiates the contract before the date of delivery, the other party 
may either treat the contract as still subsisting and wait till the date of delivery, or he may treat the contract 
as rescinded and sue for damages for the breach. 
In case the contract is treated as still subsisting it would be for the benefit of both the parties and the party 
who had originally repudiated will not be deprived of: 
 
(a) his right of performance on the due date in spite of his prior repudiation; or 
 
(b) his rights to set up any defence for non-performance which might have actually arisen after the date 
of the prior repudiation. 
Measure of Damages 
The Act does not specifically provide for rules as regards the measure of damages except by stating that 
nothing in the Act shall affect the right of the seller or the buyer to recover interest or special damages in any 
case where by law they are entitled to the same. The inference is that the rules laid down in Section 73 of the 
Indian Contract Act will apply. 
Unpaid Seller (Sections 45-54) 
Who is an unpaid seller? (Section 45) 
The seller of goods is deemed to be unpaid seller: 
 
(a) When the whole of the price has not been paid or tendered; or 
                                                                       Lesson 22        Sale of Goods Act, 1930 
569 
 
(b) When a conditional payment was made by a bill of exchange or other negotiable instrument, and 
the instrument has been dishonoured. 
Rights of an Unpaid Seller against the Goods 
An unpaid seller’s right against the goods are: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a) Right of Lien (Sections 47-49 and 54) An unpaid seller in possession of goods sold, may exercise his lien 
on the goods, i.e., keep the goods in his possession and refuse to deliver them to the buyer until the 
fulfilment or tender of the price in cases where: 
 
(i) the goods have been sold without stipulation as to credit; or 
 
(ii) the goods have been sold on credit, but the term of credit has expired; or 
 
(iii) the buyer becomes insolvent. 
The lien depends on physical possession. The seller’s lien is possessory lien, so that it can be exercised only 
so long as the seller is in possession of the goods. It can only be exercised for the non-payment of the price 
and not for any other charges. 
A lien is lost 
 
(i) When the seller delivers the goods to a carrier or other bailee for the purpose of transmission to the 
buyer, without reserving the right of disposal of the goods; 
 
(ii) When the buyer or his agent lawfully obtains possession of the goods; 
 
(iii) By waiver of his lien by the unpaid seller. 
(b) Stoppage in transit (Sections 50-52) The right of stoppage in transit is a right of stopping the goods while 
they are in transit, resuming possession of them and retaining possession until payment of the price. 
The right to stop goods is available to an unpaid seller 
EP-EBCL 
570 
 
(i) when the buyer becomes insolvent; and 
 
(ii) the goods are in transit. 
The buyer is insolvent if he has ceased to pay his debts in the ordinary course of business, or cannot pay his 
debts as they become due. It is not necessary that he has actually been declared insolvent by the court. 
The goods are in transit from the time they are delivered to a carrier or other bailee like a wharfinger or 
warehousekeeper for the purpose of transmission to the buyer and until the buyer takes delivery of them. 
The transit comes to an end in the following cases: 
 
(i) If the buyer obtains delivery before the arrival of the goods at their destination; 
 
(ii) If, after the arrival of the goods at their destination, the carrier acknowledges to the buyer that he 
holds the goods on his behalf, even if further destination of the goods is indicated by the buyer; 
 
(iii) If the carrier wrongfully refuses to deliver the goods to the buyer. 
If the goods are rejected by the buyer and the carrier or other bailee holds them, the transit will be deemed to 
continue even if the seller has refused to receive them back. 
The right to stop in transit may be exercised by the unpaid seller either by taking actual possession of the 
goods or by giving notice of the seller’s claim to the carrier or other person having control of the goods. On 
notice being given to the carrier, he must redeliver the goods to the seller who must pay the expenses of the 
redelivery. 
The seller’s right of lien or stoppage in transit is not affected by any sale on the part of the buyer unless the 
seller has assented to it. A transfer, however, of the bill of lading or other document of seller to a bona fide 
purchaser for value is valid against the seller’s right. 
(c) Right of re-sale (Section 54): The unpaid seller may re-sell: 
 
(i) where the goods are perishable; 
 
(ii) where the right is expressly reserved in the contract; 
 
(iii) where in exercise of right of lien or stoppage in transit, the seller gives notice to the buyer of his 
intention to re-sell, and the buyer, does not pay or tender the price within a reasonable time. 
 
 If on a re-sale, there is a deficiency between the price due and amount realised, he is entitled to 
recover it from the buyer. If there is a surplus, he can keep it. He will not have these rights if he has 
not given any notice and he will have to pay the buyer profit, if any, on the resale. 
(d) Rights to withhold delivery: If the property in the goods has passed, the unpaid seller has right as 
described above. If, however, the property has not passed, the unpaid seller has a right of withholding 
delivery similar to and co-extensive with his rights of lien and stoppage in transit. 
Rights of an unpaid seller against the buyer (Sections 55 and 56) 
An unpaid seller may sue the buyer for the price of the goods in case of breach of contract where the 
property in the goods has passed to the buyer or he has wrongfully refused to pay the price according to the 
terms of the contract. 
The seller may sue the buyer even if the property in the goods has not passed where the price is payable on 
a certain day. 
Under Section 56, the seller may sue the buyer for damages or breach of contract where the buyer 
wrongfully neglects or refuses to accept and pay for the goods. 
                                                                       Lesson 22        Sale of Goods Act, 1930 
571 
Thus an unpaid sellers rights against the buyer personally are: 
 
(a) a suit for the price. 
 
(b) a suit for damages. 
Auction Sales (Section 64) 
A sale by auction is a public sale where goods are offered to be taken by bidders. It is a proceeding at which 
people are invited to complete for the purchase of property by successive offer of advancing sums. 
Section 64 lays down the rules regulating auction sales. Where goods are put up for sale in lots, each, lot is 
prima facie deemed to be the subject of a separate contract of sale. The sale is complete when the 
auctioneer announces its completion by the fall of the hammer or in other customary manner. Until such 
announcement is made, any bidder may retract his bid. 
A right to bid may be reserved expressly by or on behalf of the seller. Where such right is expressly so 
reserved, the seller or any other person on his behalf may bid at the auction. Where the sale is not notified to 
be subject to a right to bid on behalf of the seller, it shall not be lawful for the seller to bid himself or to employ 
any person to bid at such sale, or for the auctioneer knowingly to take any bid from the seller or any such 
person. Any sale in contravention of this rule may be treated as fraudulent by the buyer. The sale may be 
notified to be subject to a reserved price. Where there is such notification, every bid is a conditional offer 
subject to its being up to the reserve price. Where an auctioneer inadvertently knocks down to a bidder who 
has bid less than the reserved price, there is no contract of sale. If the seller makes use of pretended bidding to 
raise the price, the sale is voidable at the option of the buyer. 
Trading Contracts Involving Rail or Sea Transit 
In the case of a contract for the sale of goods which are to be shipped by sea a number of conditions are 
attached by the parties or by custom and practice of merchants. Some of the important types of such 
contracts are given below: 
 
(a) F.O.B.(Free on Board): Under an F.O.B. contract, it is the duty of the seller to put the goods on 
board a ship at his own expenses. The property in goods passes to the buyer only after the goods 
have been put on board the ship, and they are at buyer’s risk as soon as they are put on board the 
ship, usually named by the buyer. The seller must notify the buyer immediately that the goods have 
been delivered on board, so that the buyer may insure them. If he fails to do so the goods shall be 
deemed to be at seller’s risk during such sea transit. 
 
(b) F.O.R. (Free on Rail): Similar position prevails in these contracts as in the case of F.O.B. contracts. 
 
(c) C.I.F. or C.F.I. (Cost Insurance and Freight): A CIF contract is a contract for the sale of insured 
goods lost or not lost to be implemented by transfer of proper documents. 
 
 In such types of contracts, the seller not only bears all the expenses of putting the goods on board 
the ship as in an F.O.B. contract, but also to bear the freight and insurance charges. He will arrange 
for an insurance of the goods for the benefit of the buyer. On the tender of documents, the buyer is 
required to pay and then take delivery. He has a right to reject the goods if they are not according to 
the contract. 
 
(d) Ex-Ship: Here the seller is bound to arrange the shipment of the goods to the port of destination, 
and to such further inland destination as the buyer may stipulate. The buyer is not bound to pay until 
the goods are ready for unloading from the ship and all freight charges paid. The goods travel at the 
seller’s risk, but he is not bound to insure them.

LESSON ROUND-UP 
• 
In a sale, the property in the goods sold passes to the buyer at the time of contract so that he 
becomes the owner of the goods. In an agreement to sell, the ownership does not pass to the buyer 
at the time of the contract, but it passes only when it becomes sale on the expiry of certain time or 
the fulfilment of some conditions subject to which the property in the goods is to be transferred. 
• 
Where goods are delivered to another on terms which indicate that the property is to pass at once 
the contract must be one of sale and not bailment. 
• 
The subject matter of the contract of sale is essentially goods. According to Section 2(7) of the Sale 
of Goods Act, “goods” means every kind of movable property other than actionable claims and 
money and includes stock and shares, growing crops, grass and things attached to or forming part of 
the land which are agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract of sale. Goods may be (a) 
existing, (b) future, or (c) contingent. The existing goods may be (i) specific or generic, (ii) 
ascertained or unascertained. 
• 
The sole purpose of a sale is the transfer of ownership of goods from the seller to the buyer. The 
general rule is that only the owner of goods can sell the goods. Conversely, the sale of an article by 
a person who is not or who has not the authority of the owner, gives no title to the buyer. 
• 
It is the duty of the seller and buyer that the contract is performed. The duty of the seller is to deliver 
the goods and that of the buyer to accept the goods and pay for them in accordance with the 
contract of sale. 
• 
Unless otherwise agreed, payment of the price and the delivery of the goods and concurrent 
conditions, i.e., they both take place at the same time as in a cash sale over a shop counter. 
• 
Delivery is the voluntary transfer of possession from one person to another. Delivery may be actual, 
constructive or symbolic. 
• 
A sale by auction is a public sale where goods are offered to be taken by bidders. It is a proceeding 
at which people are invited to complete for the purchase of property by successive offer of advancing 
sums.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Likewise  corporations which  are regulated  by 
Companies Act,  2013,  the  other  form  of business 
is  partnership which is  regulated by Indian 
Partnership Act, 1932. The partnership is considered 
as the convenient way to start a business. Suppose 
one wants to open a bookshop in the locality.  There  
are  various things  that  are  required  to  start  and  
run  the business which may not be feasible to 
arrange all alone. These may include resources from 
money to place to management. In that case, the 
idea may be spoken to friends and relatives who  
may  agree  to  run  the  bookshop  by contributing  a  
certain  amount  of  money  and other things 
required. So all of them join hands together to 
become the owners and agree to share profits and 
losses. 
This  chapter  deals  with  laws  relating  to 
partnership  that  will  regulate  this  form  of 
business,  its  registration,  admission  of  new 
partners, and dissolution. It also explains other 
aspects of partnership like kinds of partners, 
relationship among themselves and with others. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
There's an assumption by many partners that no matter what happens to their business, they'll be partners forever.

INTRODUCTION 
The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, came into force w.e.f.  1st October, 1932 except section 69, which came  
into force on the 1st day of October, 1933. It extends to the whole of India except the state of Jammu and 
Kashmir. 
It lays down the important provisions relating to partnership contracts. However, the general principles of the 
Indian Contracts Act, 1872 which formally contained the provisions of the law of partnership shall apply so far 
as they are not inconsistent with this Act. (Section 3) 
DEFINITIONS 
 
Partnership 
According to Section 4 “Partnership is the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of 
a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all”. 
When analysed, the definition tells us that in order that persons may become partners, it is essential that: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All these four elements must be present before a group or an association can be held to be partners. In other 
words, it can be said that all the aforestated four elements must co-exist before a partnership can be said to 
come into existence. If any one of them is not proved to be present, there cannot be a partnership. The first 
element relates to the voluntary contractual nature of partnership; the second gives the motive which leads to 
the formation of firms, i.e. the acquisition of gains; the third shows that the persons of the group who conduct 
the business  do so as agents for all the persons in the group, and are therefore liable to account to all the 
persons in the group (Maliram Choudhary v. Jagannath, AIR 1972 Orissa 17). 
Partners, Firm and Firm Name 
 Persons who have entered into partnership with one another are called individually “partners” and 
collectively “a firm”, and the name under which their business is carried on is called the “firm name”. 
(Section 4) 
                                                                       Lesson 23        Indian Partnership Act, 1932 
575 
In law, “a firm” is only a convenient phrase for describing the partners, and the firm has no legal existence 
apart from its partners. It is neither a legal entity, nor is it a person as is a corporation; it is a collective name 
of the members of a partnership. 
As regard the “firm name”, partners have a right to carry on business under any name and style which they 
choose to adopt, provided they do not violate the rules relating to trade name or goodwill. They must not 
adopt name calculated to mislead the public into confusing them with a firm of repute already in existence 
with a similar name. They must not use a name implying the sanction of patronage of the Government. A 
partnership firm cannot use the word “Limited” as a part of its name. 
Essentials of a Partnership and True Test of Partnership 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These elements are discussed below in detail: 
(1) Association of two or more persons 
There must be a contract between two or more persons. Therefore unless there are at least two persons 
there can not be a partnership. Persons must be competent to enter into a contract. They may all be natural 
or artificial or some natural and other artificial. Thus a corporation or limited partnership may itself be a 
partner in a general partnership. 
(2) Agreement 
Existence of an agreement is essential of partnership. Section 5 of the Act states that the relation of 
partnership arises from contract and not from status; and in particular, the members of a Hindu Undivided 
Family carrying on a family business as such, or a Burmese Buddhist Husband and wife carrying on 
business as such are not partners in such business. 
Such an agreement between the partners may be express or implied. Further, the agreement must be a valid 
agreement and for a lawful object and purpose and between the persons competent to contract. 
(3) Business 
Partnership implies business and when there is no association to carry on business there is no partnership. 
EP-EBCL 
576 
The term “business” is, however, used in the widest sense to cover trade, occupation and profession. As per 
Section 2(b) of the Act the term “business” includes every trade, occupation and profession. In the definition 
of partnership the word “business” is used in the sense of “carrying on business” which suggests continuity 
or repetition of acts. But it does not mean that it should be confined to lengthy operations, it may consist of a 
single adventure of a single undertaking, if there is continued participation of two or more persons for 
acquisition of gains. 
The term must be understood in a particular sense . It refers to any activity which, if successful, would result 
in profit. 
(4) Sharing of Profits 
To constitute a partnership, the parties must have agreed to carry on a business and to share profits in 
common. “Profits” mean the excess of returns over advances, the excess of what is obtained over the cost of 
obtaining it. Sharing of profits also involves sharing of losses. But whereas the sharing of profit is an 
essential element of partnership, the sharing of losses is not. It is open to one or more partners to bear all 
the losses of the business. 
It follows that the sharing of profits is an essential ingredient of partnership and there would be no 
partnership where only one of the partners is entitled to the whole of the profits of the business. But it is open 
to the partners to agree to share the profits in any way they like. They may agree to share the profits either in 
specific proportions or in specific sums.  
Sharing of Profits is not Conclusive 
Test Although sharing of profits is a prima facie evidence of the existence of partnership, this is not the 
conclusive test of the same.  A person may have a share in the partnership profits, but still may not be a 
partner. For instance, a joint owner of a property sharing its return or members of non-profit or non-trading 
associations will not be called partners. 
Illustrations 
 
1.  A and B buy 100 bales of cotton, which they agree to sell for their joint account, each party sharing 
profits and bearing losses equally. A and B are partners in respect of such account. 
 
2.  A and B buy 100 bales of cotton agreeing to divide these between them. A and B are not partners. 
 
3. “A” a trader, owed money to XY&Z. He agreed to pay XY&Z out of the profits of his business (run 
under the supervision of X, Y and Z) what he owed to them. It was held that the arrangement does 
not make X, Y and Z the partners with A in the business. 
(5) Mutual Agency The True Test 
Mutual agency is the foundation of partner’s liability. Each partner is both an agent and principal for himself 
and others; that is the significance of the phrase “carried on by all or any of them acting for all”. Each partner 
is an agent binding the other partners who are his principal and each partner is again a principal, who in turn 
is bound by the acts of the other partners. In other words, there must be facts or circumstances from which it 
can be inferred that each of the persons alleged to be partners was the agent, real or implied of another. 
What is essential is that the partner who conducts the business of the firm not only acts for himself but for the 
other partners also. 
The true test, therefore, in determining whether a partnership exists, is to see whether the relation of 
principal and agent exists between the parties and not merely whether the parties share the profits or the 
                                                                       Lesson 23        Indian Partnership Act, 1932 
577 
business is carried on for the benefit of all. It is this relation of agency among partners which distinguishes a 
partnership from a single co-ownership on the one hand and the agreement to share profits on the other. The 
existence of this relation of agency can be gathered from the real intention of the parties and the 
circumstances of the case. The question of intention must be decided on the basis of the conduct of parties 
and of all the surrounding circumstances. The law of partnership is the extention of the law of agency 
therefore every partner is liable for the act of other partner if within authority upto unlimited extent. The 
relation of mutual agency is the conclusive test of partnership. 
It may be observed that the question whether a person is or is not a partner depends almost in all cases 
upon whether he has the authority to act for other partners and whether other partners have the authority to 
act for him. It follows that the agency relationship is the most important test of partnership. 
Formation of Partnership 
According to the definition of partnership under the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, there must be an 
agreement between the partners of a partnership firm. 
The partnership agreement must comply with all the essentials of a valid contract. There must be free 
consent of the parties who must be competent to contract and the object of partnership should not be 
forbidden by law or immoral or opposed to public policy. Two exceptions, however, may be noted: 
 
(i) A minor may be admitted to the benefits of a partnership with the consent of all other partners. 
 
(ii) As relations of partners inter se are that of agency, no consideration is required to create the 
partnership. 
Partnership Deed 
The agreement of partnership may be oral but to avoid future disputes it is always advisable to have it in 
writing. The mutual rights and obligations of partners must be discussed in detail and should be put into 
writing in the shape of a ‘Partnership Deed’, before the partnership is actually started. Thus, the written 
document which contains the mutual rights and obligations of partners is known as partnership deed. (The 
partnership deed is also called as ‘Partnership Agreement’, ‘Constitution of Partnership’, ‘Articles of 
Partnership’ etc.). The deed must be property drafted and stamped according to the provisions of the Indian 
Stamp Act. Each partner should be given a copy of the deed and if the firm is to be registered, a copy of the 
deed should be filed with the Registrar of Firms at the time of such legislation. The partnership deed is not a 
public document and therefore binds only third parties so far as they have notice of it. 
Contents of Partnership Deed 
The exact terms of the partnership deed (or agreement) will depend upon the circumstances  but  generally  
a partnership deed contains the following covenants: 
 
(i) The firm name and business to be carried on under that name. 
 
(ii) Names and addresses of partners. 
 
(ii) Nature and scope of business and address(s) of business place(s). 
 
(iv) Commencement and duration of partnership. 
 
(v) The capital and the contribution made by each partner. 
 
(vi) Provision for further capital and loans by partners to the firm. 
 (vii) Partner’s drawings. 
EP-EBCL 
578 
 (viii) Interest on capital, loans, drawings and current account. 
 
(ix) Salaries, commission and remuneration to partners, 
 
(x) Profit (or loss) sharing ratio of partners. 
 
(xi) The keeping of proper books of accounts, inspection and audit, Bank Accounts and their operation. 
 (xii) The accounting period and the date on which that accounts are to be prepared. 
 (xiii) Rights, powers and duties of the partners.  
 (xiv) Whether and in what circumstances, notice of retirement or dissolution can be given by a partner. 
 (xv) Provision that death or retirement of a partner will not bring about dissolution of partnership, 
 (xvi) Valuation of goodwill on retirement, death, dissolution etc. 
 (xvii) The method of valuation of assets (and liabilities) on retirement or death  of  any partner. 
 (xviii) Provision for expulsion of a partner. 
 (xix) Provision regarding the allocation of business activities to be performed by individual partners. 
 (xx) The arbitration clause for the settlement of disputes. The terms contained in the partnership deed 
may be varied with the consent of all the parties, and such consent may be express or implied by a 
course of dealing. [Section 11(1)] 
Classification of Partnership 
A partnership may either be for a particular adventure or for a fixed period. It may also be a partnership at 
will. From the duration point of view, a partnership may be classified into the following two categories: 
(i) Particular Partnership (Section 8) 
“A person may become a partner with another person in a particular adventure or undertaking”. When two or 
more persons agree to do business in a particular adventure or undertaking, such a partnership is called 
“Particular Partnership”. Thus, a particular partnership may even be for a single adventure or undertaking. 
(ii) Partnership at Will (Section 7) 
“Where no provision is made by contract between the partners for the duration of their partnership or for the 
determination of their partnership, the partnership is called Partnership at Will”. A partnership is deemed to 
be a partnership at will when (i) no fixed period has been agreed upon for the duration of partnership, and (ii) 
there is no provision made as to the determination of partnership in any other way. The partnership at will 
has no fixed or definite date of termination and, therefore, death or retirement of a partner does not affect the 
existence of such partnership. 
Section 43(1) provides that “Where the partnership is at will, the firm may be dissolved by any partner giving 
notice in writing to all the other partners of his intention to dissolve the firm. The firm is dissolved as from the 
date mentioned in the notice as the date of dissolution or, if no such date is mentioned, as from the date of 
communication of the notice”. This accounts for the importance of the definition of ‘Partnership at Will’. 
Co-ownership and Partnership 
There is a possibility that two co-owners may employ their property in a business and share the profits, and 
still be not partners. A distinction between the two is in point. Partnership is between two persons Co- 
ownership is not always the result of an agreement: it may arise by the operation of law or from status, e.g., 
co-heirs of a property. Partnership must arise from an agreement. A partner is the agent of the other 
                                                                       Lesson 23        Indian Partnership Act, 1932 
579 
partners, but a co-owner is not the agent of the other co-owner(s). Co-ownership does not necessarily 
involve community of profits and loss, partnership does. A co- owner can without the consent of the others 
transfer his rights and interests to strangers, a partner cannot do so without the consent of all the other 
partners so as to make the transferee a partner in the firm. A co-owner can ask for division of property in 
specie, but no partner can ask for this. His only right is to have a share of the profits out of the properties. 
Partnerships end at death or insolvency; co-ownerships end at death. A co-owner has no lien on the property 
while a partner has a lien on the firm property. 
Hindu Joint Family Firm and Partnership 
A Hindu joint family firm differs from a partnership in the following ways: 
A partnership comes into existence by means of a contract between the partners; a Hindu joint family firm 
arises as a result of status, i.e., by birth in the family. The death of a partner dissolves the partnership, but 
the death of a co-parcener does not dissolve the family firm. In a joint family firm only the Karta or manager 
(who is the head of the family) has implied authority to borrow and bind other members; in a partnership 
each partner is entitled to do so. Every partner is personally liable for the debts of the firm; in a joint family 
business only the Karta is personally liable. A minor is a member of a joint family firm from the very day of his 
birth by virtue of his status, but he is not personally liable. A minor cannot be a partner, although he may be 
admitted to the benefits of partnership. A partner can demand the accounts of the firm, a co-parcener cannot 
ask for accounts, his only remedy is to ask for partition of the assets of the family firm. No registration of a 
family firm is necessary, while a partnership firm must be registered before it can maintain suits against 
outsiders. Each partner has a definite share in the business and this can be changed only by agreement, but 
the share of a co-parcener is not fixed; it may be enlarged by death or reduced by a birth in the family. There 
is a definite limit to the number of partners, but there is no such limit in the case of a Hindu joint family firm. A 
Hindu joint family business is governed by Hindu Law, while Indian Partnership Act, governs partnerships 
and excludes Hindu joint family firms. (Section 5) 
Company and Partnership 
The members constituting a partnership do not form a whole as distinct from the individuals composing it. 
The firm has no legal entity and has no rights and obligations separate from the partners. In a firm every 
partner is an agent of the rest of the partners, but a member of a company is neither the agent of the 
company nor of other members. A company, as soon as it is incorporated, say by registration under the 
Companies Act, becomes a legal entity distinct from its members constituting it (Salomon v. Salomon & Co., 
1897, A.C. 22). It can sue and be sued in its own name like any natural person. In a partnership, there are 
rights and obligations as against individual partners, but in the case of a company, the rights and obligations 
are as against the fictitious entity of the whole of the company and not the members composing it. The 
creditors of the partnership can call upon individual partners to pay the firm’s debt, but the members of a 
company  are not personally liable for the company’s debts. In other words, a partner’s liability is unlimited 
while the liability of the members of a company is limited to the extent of the amount remaining unpaid on 
their shares (Prasad v. Missir). Partnership firm may dissolve by the death or insolvency of a partner, but a 
company is not affected by the death or insolvency of a member. A partner cannot transfer his interest so as 
to substitute the transferee in his place as the partner, without the consent of all the other partners; a 
member can transfer his share to any one he likes. 
Change in a Firm 
The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, contemplates the following changes in a partnership firm: 
 
(1) Changes in the constitution of a firm. 
EP-EBCL 
580 
 
(2) Changes in the nature of a business or undertakings. 
 
(3) Changes in the duration of a firm. 
A change in the constitution of a firm takes place when: 
 
(a) a new partner is introduced as a partner in a firm; (Section 31) 
 
(b) a partner retires from a firm; (Section 32), 
 
(c) a partner is expelled from a firm; (Section 33), 
 
(d) a partner is adjudicated as an insolvent; (Section 34) and 
 
(e) a partner dies. (Section 35) 
A change in the nature of the business can only be brought about by the consent of all the partners. Thus, a 
partnership formed for a definite purpose, agreed upon at the time of formation of the partnership, cannot 
depart from the agreed purpose without the consent of all the partners [Section 12(c)]. Section 17(c)provides 
for a case whether a partnership firm is formed  for a particular undertaking or undertakings, it proceeds  to 
carry on other undertaking or undertakings, in that event the mutual rights and duties of the partners in 
respect of the other adventures or undertakings are the same as those in respect of the original adventures 
of undertakings. 
Partnership Property 
It is open to the partners to agree among themselves as to what is to be treated as the property of the firm, 
and what is to be separate property of one or more partners, although employed for the purposes of the firm. 
In the absence of any such agreement, express or implied, the property of the firm is deemed to include: 
 
(a) all property, rights and interests which have been brought into the common stock for the purposes 
of the partnership by individual partners, whether at the commencement of the business or 
subsequently added thereto; 
 
(b) those acquired in the course of the business with money belonging to the firm; and 
 
(c) the goodwill of the business. (Section 14) 
The property of the firm belongs to the firm and not to the individual partner or partners. The ownership 
belongs to the firm, and no partner can deal with specific properties as if the properties are his own, nor does 
the partner possess any assignable interest in such property (Narayanappa v. Bhaskaia Krishnappa, AIR 
1966 SC 1300). What is meant by the share of a partner is his proportion of the partnership assets after they 
are all realised and converted into money, and all the partnership debts and liabilities have been paid and 
discharged. If certain partners jointly own immovable property which they use for the purposes of the 
partnership business, the mere use of such property does not make such property as partnership property. 
Whether such property is or is not partnership property depends upon the agreement between the partners 
(Lachhman Dass v. Mrs. Gulab Devi, AIR 1936 ALL. 270). The ultimate test to determine the property of the 
firm is the real intention of the partners and the Court can take into consideration the following facts: 
 
(1) The source of the purchase money. 
 
(2) The reason due to which the property was purchased or acquired. 
 
(3) The object for which the property was purchased or acquired. 
 
(4) The mode in which the property was obtained. 
 
(5) The mode in which the property was dealt with. 
 
(6) The use to which the property was put to. 
                                                                       Lesson 23        Indian Partnership Act, 1932 
581 
All such facts are matter of evidence  and depend on the facts of each case. These facts indicate the 
intention of the parties but are not conclusive to make a property as partnership property. These facts can be 
established by entries in the books of account of the firm and of the partners, correspondence, the deed of 
partnership, etc.  
Kinds of Partners 
The following kinds of partners generally exist in a partnership: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(i) Actual, Active or Ostensible Partner 
These are the ordinary types of partners who invest money into the business of the firm, actively participate 
in the functioning and management of the business and share its profits or losses. Section 12(a) lays down 
that “Subject to contract between the partners, every partner is entitled to take part in the conduct of the 
business of the firm”. Such partner as actively participates in the firm’s business, binds himself and other 
partners by all his acts done in the usual course of partnership business. Such partner must give a public 
notice of his retirement from the firm in order to absolve (free) himself from liability for the acts of the other 
partners done after his retirement. 
(ii) Sleeping or Dormant Partner 
These partners invest money in the firm’s business and take their share of profits but do not participate in the 
functioning and management of the business. But even then their liability is unlimited. The Act specially 
provides that if an act is binding on the firm, every partner is liable for it. 
A sleeping partner can retire from the firm without giving any public notice to this effect. His liability for the 
acts of the firm ceases soon after retirement. Such partner has no duties to perform but is entitled to have 
access to books and accounts of the firm and he can have a copy of them. 
EP-EBCL 
582 
(iii) Nominal Partner 
Some people do not invest or participate in the management of the firm but only give their name to the 
business or firm. They are nominal partners but are liable to third parties for all the acts of the firm. Unlike a 
sleeping partner, they are known to the outsiders as partners in the firm, whereas actually they are not. 
(iv) Partner in Profits Only 
A partner who is entitled to share in the profits of a partnership firm without being liable to share the losses, 
is called a partner in profits only. Thus, a person who has sufficient capital but is not prepared to take risk 
may be admitted to the partnership by the other partners. Inspite of his specific position, he continues to be 
liable to the third parties for all acts of the firm, just like other parties. 
(v) Sub-Partner 
Where a partner agrees to share his profits in the firm with a third person, that third person is called a sub-
partner. Such a sub-partner has no rights or duties towards the firm and does not carry any liability for the 
debts of the firm. Also he cannot bind the firm or other partners by his acts. 
(vi) Partner by Estoppel or Holding Out 
If the behaviour of a person arouses misunderstanding that he is a partner in a firm (when actually he is not), 
such a person is estopped from later on denying the liabilities for the acts of the firm. Such person is called 
partner by estoppel and is liable to all third parties. 
Similarly, if a person who is declared to be a partner (when actually he is not) does not deny the fact that he 
is a partner, he being held out as a partner is responsible for all liability of the business. The law relating to 
partners by holding out is contained in Section 28 of the Act which lays down thus: 
“Any one who by words, spoken or written or by conduct represents himself, or knowingly permits himself to 
be represented to be a partner in a firm, is liable as a partner in that firm to any one who has on the faith of 
any such representation given credit to the firm, whether the person representing himself or represented to 
be a partner does or does not know that the representation has reached the person so giving credit”. The 
rule as to holding out is based on the doctrine of estoppel as contained in Section 115 of the Indian Evidence 
Act. 
Holding Out means “to represent”. Strangers, who hold themselves out or represent themselves to be 
partners in a firm, whereby they induce others to give credit to the partnership are called “Partners by 
Holding Out”. 
In case of “Partnership by Estoppel”, the representation is made by partners about a stranger within his 
knowledge and hearing and he does not contradict it. He is then held liable as a partner. 
Effects of Holding out 
The Holding Out partner becomes personally and individually liable for the acts of the firm. But he does not 
become a partner in the firm and is not entitled to any rights or claim upon the firm. An outsider, who has 
given credit to the firm thinking him to be a partner, can hold him liable as if he is a partner in that firm. As the 
liability of the partners is joint and several he can be held liable to pay the entire amount. But under the 
doctrine of subrogation as well as on the basis of quasi-contract, he can recover the amount so paid from the 
partners of the firm, if they are solvent. 
Exceptions to Holding Out 
The doctrine of Holding Out is not applicable in the following cases: 
                                                                       Lesson 23        Indian Partnership Act, 1932 
583 
 
1. It does not apply to cases of torts committed by partners. A person, therefore, cannot be held liable 
for the torts of another simply because that other person held himself to be his partner. 
 
2. It does not extend to bind the estate of a deceased partner, where after a partner’s death the 
business of the firm is continued in the old firm name. [Section 28(2)] 
 
3. It also does not apply where the Holding Out partner has been adjudicated insolvent. (Section 45) 
Minor Admitted to the Benefits of Partnership 
In view of Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the decision of the Privy Council in Nohori Bibi v. 
Dharmo Das Ghose, (1903) 30 I.A 114, a minor’s agreement is altogether void and unenforceable. An 
agreement is an essential ingredient in a partnership, it follows that a minor cannot enter into an agreement of 
partnership. On the same principle, a minor cannot be clothed with all the rights and obligations of a full-fledged 
partner through a guardian. Section 5 states “The relation of partnership arises from a contract...”  The minor is 
incompetent to contract and, therefore, partnership cannot come into existence if the parties to a contract of 
partnership consist of one major and one minor. The only provision that Section 30 makes is that with the 
“consent of all the partners for the time being, a minor can be admitted into the benefits of partnership to which 
a minor is going to be admitted”. A partnership firm cannot be formed with only minors as partners. There must 
be atleast two major partners before a minor is admitted into the benefits of partnership. 
Rights of Minor 
He is entitled to his agreed share and can inspect books of account of the firm [Section 30(2)].  He can bring 
a suit for account and his share when he intends to sever his connections with the firm, but not otherwise. 
[Section 30(4)] 
A minor who was admitted to the benefits during his  minority within six months of his attaining the age of 
majority or when  he  comes  to know of his being so admitted (whichever date is later), he has to elect 
whether he wants to become a partner, or sever his connection  with  the firm.  He may give public notice of 
his election to continue or repudiate, but if he fails to give any public notice within the period stated above, he 
will be deemed to have elected to become a partner in the firm. [Section 30(5)] 
Liabilities of Minor 
1. His Share in Liability 
A minor partner’s liability is confined only to the extent of his share in the firm. Section 30(3) provides that a 
minor’s share is liable for the acts of the firm. But a minor is not personally liable in any such act. Thus, he is 
neither personally liable nor is his private estate liable for the acts of the firm. 
2. Personal Liabilities 
Where a minor on attaining majority, elects to become a partner, he becomes personally liable as other 
partners to the third parties for all the acts of the firm done since he was admitted to the benefits of 
partnership. 
Election by Minor 
A minor who was admitted to the benefits during his minority within six months of his attaining the age of 
majority or when he comes to know of his being so admitted (whichever date is later), he has to elect 
whether he wants to become a partner, or sever his connection with the firm. He may give public notice of his 
election to continue or repudiate, but if he fails to give any public notice within the period stated above, he 
will be deemed to have elected to become a partner in the firm. [Section 30(5)] 
EP-EBCL 
584 
If he becomes or elects to become a partner, his position will be as under: 
 
1. His rights and liabilities will be similar to those of a full-fledged partner. 
 
2. He will be personally liable for all the acts of the firm, done since he was first admitted to the 
benefits of the partnership. 
 
3. His share of profits and property remains the same as was before, unless altered by agreement. 
If he elects not to become a partner, then: 
 
1. His rights and liabilities shall continue to be those of a minor upto the date of his giving public 
notice. 
 
2. His share shall not be liable for any acts of the firm done after the date of the public notice. 
 
3. He is entitled to sue the partners for his share of the property and profits in the firm. [Section 30(8)] 
Relation of Partners to one another 
The relation of partnership arises through an agreement between the parties and such an agreement 
normally provides for mutual rights and obligations, or duties of the partners. Where, however, partnership 
arises by implication, or wherever the articles of partnership are silent, or where they do not exist, the rights 
and duties of partners are governed by the Act. 
Rights of Partners 
Unless otherwise agreed by the partners, the following rules apply: 
 
(a) Every partner has a right to take part in the conduct and management of the business. [Section 
12(a)] 
 
(b) Every partner whether active or dormant, has a right of free access to all records, books and 
accounts of the business and also to examine and copy them. [Section 12(d)] 
 
(c) Every partner is entitled to share in the profits equally, unless different proportions are stipulated. 
[Section 13(b)] 
 
(d) A partner who has contributed more than the share of the capital for the purpose of the business is 
entitled to an interest at a rate agreed upon, and where no rate is stipulated for, at six per cent per 
annum. But a partner cannot claim interest on capital, unless there is an agreement to pay it. 
[Section 13(d)] 
 
(e) A partner is entitled to be indemnified by the firm for all expenses incurred by him in the course of 
the business, for all payments made by him in respect of partnership debts or liabilities and 
disbursements made in an emergency for protecting the firm from loss. [Section 13(e)] 
 
(f) Every partner is, as a rule, a joint owner of the partnership property, and have it applied exclusively 
for the purposes of the partnership. (Section 15) 
 
(g) A partner has power to act in an emergency for protecting the firm from loss. (Section 21) 
 
(h) Every partner is entitled to prevent the introduction of a new partner into the firm without his 
consent. (Section 31) 
 
(i) Every partner has a right to retire by giving notice where the partnership is at will. [Section 32(1)(c)] 
 
(j) Every partner has a right to continue in the partnership and not to be expelled from it. [Section 
33(1)] 
                                                                       Lesson 23        Indian Partnership Act, 1932 
585 
 
(k) An incoming partner will not be liable for any debts or liabilities of the firm before he becomes a 
partner. [Section 31(2)] (l) 
 
(l) Every outgoing partner has a right to carry on a competitive business under certain conditions. 
(Section 36) 
Duties of Partners 
Apart from any duties imposed by the partnership articles, the following statutory duties are implied: 
 
(a) Every partner is bound to carry on the business of the firm to the greatest common advantage. 
(Section 9) 
 
(b) Every partner must be just and faithful to other partners. (Section 9) 
 
(c) A partner is bound to keep and render true, proper and correct accounts of the partnership. (Section 
9) 
 
(d) Utmost good faith between the partners is the rule and one partner must not take advantage of the 
other. As an agent of other partners, every partner is bound to communicate full information to 
them. (Section 9) 
 
(e) Every partner must account for any benefits derived from the partnership business without the 
consent of the other partners, i.e., a partner must not make “secret profits”. [Section 16(a)] 
 
(f) A partner must not compete with the firm, without the consent of the other partners. Any profits 
made by such unauthorised competition can be claimed by the firm. [Section 16(b)] 
 
(g) Every partner is bound to attend diligently to the business of the firm and in the absence of any 
agreement to the contrary, he is not entitled to receive any remuneration. [Section 12(b) and 13(a)] 
 
(h) In the absence of an agreement to the contrary, every partner is bound to share losses equally with 
the others. [Section 13(b)] 
 
(i) Every partner must hold and use the partnership property exclusively for the firm. (Section 15) 
 
(j) Every partner is bound to indemnify the firm for any loss caused by fraud in the conduct of the 
business. (Section 10) 
 
(k) A partner who is guilty of wilful neglect in the conduct of the business and the firm suffers loss in 
consequence, is bound to make compensation to the firm and other partners. [Section 13(f)] 
 
(l) No partner can assign or transfer his partnership interest to any other person, so as to make him a 
partner in the business. (Section 29) 
 (m) But a partner may assign the profits and share in the partnership assets. But the assignee or 
transferee will have no right to ask for the accounts or to interfere in the management of the 
business; he would be entitled only to share the actual profits. On dissolution of the firm, he will be 
entitled to the share of the assets and also to accounts but only from the date of dissolution. 
(Section 29) 
 
(n) Every partner is bound to act within the scope of his actual authority. If he exceeds his authority, he 
shall compensate the other partners for loss unless they ratify his act. 
Relation of Partners to Third Parties 
 
Partners as Agents 
Every partner is an agent of the firm and of other partners for the purpose of the business of the firm (Section 
18). In the case of a partnership each partner is a principal and each one is an agent for the other partners. A 
EP-EBCL 
586 
partner is both a principal and an agent. Thus, the general law of agency is incorporated into the law of 
partnership. The law of partnership is often regarded as branch of the law of agency. The acts of every 
partner who does any act for carrying on in the usual way the business of the kind carried on by the firm bind 
the firm and his partners unless: 
 
(i) The partner so acting has no authority to act for the firm in that matter; and 
 
(ii) The person with whom he is dealing knows that he has no authority; or 
 
(iii) Does not know or believe him to be a partner. 
Authority of a Partner 
The authority of a partner means the capacity of a partner to bind the firm by his act. This authority may be 
express or implied. 
(i) Express Authority: - Authority is said to be express when it is given by words, spoken or written. The firm 
is bound by all acts of a partner done within the scope of his express authority even if the acts are not within 
the scope of the partnership business. 
(ii) Implied Authority: - The implied authority of a partner is also known as ostensible or apparent authority, 
Sections 19 and 22 contain provisions regarding the scope of the implied authority of a partner. The implied 
authority is subject to the following conditions: 
 
(1) the act done must relate to the “normal business” of the firm; 
 
(2) the act must be done in the usual way; 
 
(3) the act must be done in the name of the firm. 
Implied Authority of a Partner 
Subject to the limitations mentioned above, every partner has an implied authority to bind the firm by the 
following acts: 
 
(i) By selling firm’s goods; 
 
(ii) By purchasing goods for the firm; 
 
(iii) By accepting any payment of debts due to the firm; and 
 
(iv) By engaging and discharging employees. 
In a Trading Firm (one which carries on business of buying and selling goods), a partner has the following 
additional powers: 
 
(i) To borrow money on the firm’s credit and to pledge the firm’s goods for that purpose; 
 
(ii) To accept, make and issue negotiable instruments in the firm’s name; and 
 
(iii) To employ a solicitor or attorney on behalf of the firm (Bank of Australasia v. Beriliat, (1847) 6 Moor, 
P.C. 152 at pp. 193-94). 
Acts beyond Implied Authority 
Section 19(2) states that in the absence of any usage or custom or trade to the contrary, the implied authority 
of a partner does not empower him to: 
 
(a) submit a dispute relating to the business of the firm to arbitration; 
                                                                       Lesson 23        Indian Partnership Act, 1932 
587 
 
(b) open a banking account on behalf of the firm in his own name; 
 
(c) compromise or relinquish any claim or portion of a claim by the firm; 
 
(d) withdraw a suit or proceeding filed on behalf of the firm; 
 
(e) admit any liability in a suit or proceedings against the firm; 
 
(f) acquire immovable property on behalf of the firm; 
 
(g) transfer immovable property belonging to the firm; and 
 
(h) enter into a partnership on behalf of the firm. 
Extent of Partners’ Liability 
It is, however, open to the partners by means of an express contract to extend or limit the implied authority, 
but third parties will be bound by such limitations only when they have notice of such curtailment. 
All partners are liable jointly and severally for all acts or omissions binding on the firm including liabilities 
arising from contracts as well as torts (Section 25). This is known as the liability of partners for the acts of the 
firm.  But in order that an act done may be an act of the firm and, therefore, binding on the firm, it is 
necessary that the partner doing the act on behalf of the firm must have done that act in the name of and on 
behalf of the firm and not in his personal capacity. And the act must have been done in the ordinary course 
of the business of the firm. [Sections 19(1) and 22] 
Liability of the Firm for Torts 
Every partner is liable for the negligence and fraud of the other partners in the course of the management of 
business. A partner charges the firm if he acts as an agent for it. The firm is similarly liable where a partner 
commits a tort with the authority of his co-partners. (Section 26) 
If a partner acting within the scope of his apparent authority receives the property of a third person and 
misapplies it, or if the firm in the course of its business receives the property of a third person and, while it is in 
the firm’s custody, a partner misapplies it, in each case the firm is liable to make good the loss. (Section 27) 
Liability of an Incoming Partner 
As a general rule, an incoming partner is not liable for the debts incurred before he joined the firm as a 
partner [Section 31(2)]. The incoming partner may, however, assume liability for past debts by novation, i.e., 
by a tripartite agreement between (i) the creditor of the firm, (ii) the partners existing at the time the debt was 
incurred, and (iii) the incoming partner. 
Liability of an Outgoing or Retiring Partner 
An outgoing partner remains liable for the partnership debts contracted while he was a partner. He may, 
however, be discharged by novation, i.e., by an agreement between himself, the new firm and the creditors. 
He may also continue to be liable after retirement if he allows himself to be held out as a partner, e.g. by 
allowing his name to remain the firm name. To protect himself from his liability, he should give express notice 
of his retirement to the persons who were dealing with the firm before his retirement or give public notice in 
the manner as laid down in Section 72 of the Act, that is to say, by publishing it in the Official Gazette and in 
at least one vernacular newspaper where the firm carries on the business. [Section 32(3)] 
Death or Insolvency 
The estate of a partner who dies, or who becomes insolvent, is not liable for partnership debts contracted after 
EP-EBCL 
588 
the date of the death or insolvency. It will, however, be liable for debts incurred before death or insolvency. 
(Sections 34 and 35) 
Dissolution 
According to Section 39 “The dissolution of partnership between all the partners of a firm” is called the 
“Dissolution of the Firm”. A dissolution does not necessarily follow because the partnership has ceased to do 
business, for the partnership may continue for the purpose of realising the assets. 
The Partnership Act makes a distinction between the “dissolution of partnership” and “dissolution of firm”. 
Where there is dissolution of partnership between all the partners of a firm, it is a dissolution of the firm 
(Section 39). Where there is an extinction of relationship between some of the partners only, it is a 
dissolution of partnership. So the dissolution of a partnership may or may not include the dissolution of the 
firm, but the dissolution of the firm necessarily means the dissolution of the partnership as well. 
Dissolution of Partnership 
The dissolution of partnership takes place (even when there is no dissolution of the firm) in the following 
circumstances: 
 
(a) By the expiry of the fixed term for which the partnership was formed.[Section 42(a)] 
 
(b) By the completion of the adventure. [Section 42(b)] 
 
(c) By the death of a partner. [Section 42(c)] 
 
(d) By the insolvency of a partner. [Section 42(d)] 
 
(e) By the retirement of a partner. [Section 42(e)] 
In all the above cases, the remaining partners may continue the firm in pursuance of an agreement to that 
effect. If they do not continue then the dissolution of the firm takes place automatically. 
Dissolution of the Firm 
In the following cases there is necessarily a breaking up or extinction of the relationship between all the 
partners of the firm, and closing up of the business: 
 
(a) By mutual agreement: A firm may be dissolved where all the partners agree that it shall be 
dissolved. (Section 40) 
 
(b) By the insolvency of all the partners but one: If all the partners except one become insolvent, the 
firm must come to an end, as a partnership firm with one partner cannot continue. [Section 41(a)] 
 
(c) By business becoming illegal: If the business of the firm becomes illegal because of some 
subsequent events, such as change of law, it is automatically or compulsorily dissolved by the 
operation of law. [Section 41(b)] 
 
(d) By notice of dissolution: Where the partnership is at will, the firm may be dissolved at any time, by 
any partner giving notice in writing of his intention to dissolve the firm, to all the other partners. The 
dissolution will take place from the date mentioned in the notice or, if no such date is mentioned, as 
from the date of the communication of the notice. (Section 43) 
Dissolution of the Firm through Court 
Unlike a partnership at will, the partnership for a fixed period cannot be dissolved by a notice. It could only be 
dissolved by Court in a suit by a partner. Though remedy of dissolution by a suit is available in case of all 
                                                                       Lesson 23        Indian Partnership Act, 1932 
589 
kinds of partnership, it is of practical importance in case of partnership for a fixed period. 
As per Section 44, the Court may order dissolution of the firm in the following circumstances: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a)  When a partner becomes of unsound mind: As the insanity of a partner does not automatically 
dissolve the firm, either the lunatic through his guardian or other partners  may file a suit for  the 
dissolution of the firm,  in either case the Court may order dissolution which will take effect from the 
date of the order. 
 
(b) Permanent incapacity of a partner: Where a partner has become permanently incapable of 
performing his duties as a partner, e.g., he becomes blind, paralytic, etc., the Court may, at the 
instance of any of the other partners, order the dissolution of the firm.  
 
(c) Misconduct of a partner affecting the business: Where a partner is guilty of misconduct, which is 
likely to affect prejudicially the business of the firm, the Court may dissolve the firm at the instance 
of any of the other partners. Gambling  by a partner or conviction of a partner for travelling without 
ticket would be sufficient ground for dissolution. 
 
(d) Persistent disregard of partnership agreement by a partner: Where a partner frequently commits 
breaches of the partnership agreement  and the other partners find it impossible to carry on the 
business, the Court may order dissolution at the instance  of the other partners. 
 
(e) Transfer of interest or share by a partner: A partner is not entitled to assign away his interest so as 
to introduce a new partner into the firm. Where a partner has transferred the whole of his interest to 
a third person or where his interest has been attached under a decree or sold under a process of 
law, the other partners may sue for dissolution.  
 
(f) Business working at a loss: The Court may dissolve a partnership firm where it is satisfied that the 
business of the firm cannot be carried on except at a loss. 
 
(g) Where just and equitable: As the grounds mentioned are not exhaustive, the Court may dissolve a 
EP-EBCL 
590 
firm on any other ground if it is satisfied that it would be just and equitable to dissolve the firm. The 
Court may order dissolution where the sub-stratum of the partnership firm has gone or where there 
is a complete deadlock and destruction of confidence between the partners [re. Yenidje Tobacco 
Co. Ltd. (1916) 2 Ch. 426]. 
Effect of Dissolution 
Continuing authority of partners 
The authority of partners to bind the firm continues so long as is necessary to wind up the business, provided 
that the firm is in no case bound by the acts of a partner who  has  been  adjudged  an insolvent  except  on  
the principle of holding out. (Section 47) 
Also each partner has an equitable lien over the firm’s assets entitling him to have them applied in payment 
of the firm’s debts, and in payment of whatever is due to partner. This lien can be enforced by injunction 
forbiding unfair distribution. (Section 46) 
Continuing liability of partners 
The partners continue to be liable to outsiders for any act done by any of them which would have been an 
act of the firm if done before the dissolution, unless a public notice is given of the dissolution. 
After dissolution, the rights and obligations of partners continue in all things necessary for the winding up of 
the business. The partners may complete unfinished transactions. But this authority is only for the winding up 
of the affairs of the firm and not for new transactions. 
Right to Return of Premium 
To buy entry into an existing firm, a new partner sometimes has to pay a premium to the existing partners in 
addition to any investment of capital. On dissolution, he is entitled to demand the return of a proportion of  the 
premium  if the partnership was for a fixed term and was dissolved before the expiry of that term, unless 
dissolution was caused by (i) agreement, or (ii) misconduct of the party seeking return of the premium, or (iii) 
death of a partner. (Section 51) 
Settlement of Accounts on Dissolution 
Section 48 of the Act provides that in settling accounts between the partners after a dissolution of 
partnership, the following rules shall, subject to any agreement, be observed: 
 
(a) Losses, including deficiencies of capital shall be paid first out of undistributed profits, next out of 
capital, and lastly, if necessary, by the partners individually in the proportion in which they were 
entitled to share profits 
 
(b) The assets of the firm, including the sums, contributed by the partners to make up losses or 
deficiencies of capital shall be applied in the following manner and order: 
 
(i) in paying outside creditors; 
 
(ii) in repaying advances made by partners (distinct from investment of capital); 
 
(iii) in repaying capital to partners; and  
 
(iv) the ultimate residue, if any, shall be divided among the partners in the proportions in which profits 
are divisible. 
Where the assets are not sufficient, the partners have to bear the loss in equal shares. After they have 
                                                                       Lesson 23        Indian Partnership Act, 1932 
591 
contributed their share of the deficiency they will be paid rateably the amount due to them by way of their 
capital (The Rule followed in the case of Garner v. Murray, 1904 73 L.J. Ch. 66). 
Loss due to insolvency of partners 
In case a partner is insolvent and is not able to contribute towards the deficiency, the principle laid down in the 
case of Garner vs. Murray will be applicable. 
It helds that: 
 
(a) The solvent partners will contribute only their share of deficiency in cash 
 
(b) The available assets should be distributed among the solvent partners in proportion to their capital. 
 
(c) Thus, the deficiency of capital of the insolvent partners will be distributed among the solvent 
partners in the ratio of their respective capitals. 
Goodwill 
This is a partnership asset and means the benefit arising from a firm’s business connections or reputation. “It is 
the advantage which is acquired by a business, beyond the mere value of the capital, stock fund and properly 
employed therein, in consequence of the general public patronage and encouragement which it receives from 
constant or habitual customers”. Though an intangible asset, it has value; and unless otherwise agreed  in  the 
partnership articles,  upon dissolution  it must be  sold  and the proceeds of sale distributed as capital. Where 
dissolution is caused by death, the estate of the deceased partner is entitled to share in the proceeds of the sale. 
If the goodwill is sold and there is no agreement as to its disposal, any partner can carry on the business, 
provided that by doing so he does not expose former partners to liability. But if by agreement the goodwill is 
assigned to any person, he can restrain partners as explained in the next para. 
Sale of Goodwill 
Where goodwill is sold, either to a partner or to an outsider, the value is divisible among the partners in the 
same manner as they share profits and losses, unless otherwise agreed. 
The rights of the buyer and seller of the goodwill are as follows: 
 
(a) Buyer’s rights: On the sale of goodwill the buyer may, unless the terms in the contract of sale 
provide otherwise: 
 
(i) represent himself in continuing the business, 
 
(ii) maintain his exclusive rights to the use of the firm name, and  
 
(iii) solicit former customers of the business and restrain the seller of the goodwill from doing so. 
 
(b) Seller’s rights: The vendors may enter into competition with the purchaser unless he is prevented by 
a valid restraint clause in the contract of sale. 
Registration of the Firm 
Section 56-71 deal with the registration of a firm and consequences of non-registration. 
Registration 
The registration of a firm may be effected at any time by sending by post or delivering to the Registrar of the 
area in which any place of business of the firm is situated or proposed  to be situated, a statement in the 
EP-EBCL 
592 
prescribed form and accompanied by the prescribed fee, stating: 
 
(a) the name of the firm; 
 
(b) the place or principal place of business of the firm; 
 
(c) the names of any other places where the firm carries on business; 
 
(d) the date when each partner joined the firm; 
 
(e) the names in full and permanent addresses of the partners; and  
 
(f) the duration of the firm. 
The statement shall be signed and verified by all the partners or by their agents specially authorised in this 
behalf. (Section 58) 
The Partnership Act, 1932, does not make registration of a firm compulsory but it introduces certain 
disabilities, which makes registration necessary at one time or other. An unregistered firm is not an illegal 
association. 
Effects of Non-registration 
The following are the effects of non-registration of a firm: 
 
1. Sub-section (1) of Section 69 places a bar on the right of the partners of a firm  to sue each other or 
the firm for enforcing any right arising from a contract or conferred by the Partnership Act, if the firm 
is not registered and the person suing is or has not been shown in the Register of Firms as a 
partner in the firm. 
 
2. Sub-section (2) of Section 69 places a bar on the institution of a suit by or on behalf of a firm against  
a third-party if the firm is not registered and the persons suing are or have not been shown in the 
Register of Firms as partners in the firm. 
 
3. There is no bar on the right of third-parties to sue the firm or any partner. 
 
 However, the Act allows the following suits: 
 
(a) A suit for the dissolution of a firm. 
 
(b) A suit for rendering of accounts of a dissolved firm. 
 
(c) A suit for realisation of the property of a dissolved firm. 
 
(d) A suit or claim of set-off, the value of which does not exceed one hundred rupees, 
 
(e) A proceeding in execution or other proceeding incidental to or arising from a suit or claim for not 
exceeding one hundred rupees in value. 
 
(f) A suit by a firm which has no place of business in the territories to which the Indian Partnership 
Act extends. 
 
(g) A suit for the realisation of the property of an insolvent partner. 
 
(h) A suit by a firm whose places of business are situated in areas which are exempted from the 
application of Chapter VII of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932. 
Section 69 bars the very institution of a suit by an unregistered firm or by its partners. Registration is a 
condition precedent to the right to institute the suit and, therefore, the condition precedent must first be 
fulfilled before the institution of the suit. If, therefore, on the date of the institution of a suit, the firm is not 
                                                                       Lesson 23        Indian Partnership Act, 1932 
593 
registered, the subsequent registration cannot validate the suit. The only option left to the Court is to dismiss 
the suit (Prithvi Singh v. Hasan Ali, (1950) Bom. L.R. 862). By virtue of this provision a partner of an 
unregistered firm cannot institute a suit to compel the other partner or partners to join in the registration of 
firm. The only remedy of such  a partner is to institute a suit for dissolution (Keshav Lal v. Chuni Lal, AIR 
1941 Rangoon 196). A suit by the firm is really a suit by all the partners who were its partners at the time of 
the accrual of the cause of action and, therefore, all must join in the institution of the suit. 
However, an unregistered firm can bring a suit to enforce a right arising otherwise than out of contract e.g., 
for an injunction against a person for wrongful infringement of trade mark etc. 
Specific Performance of Partnership Agreement 
It is not allowed. The working of a partnership depends upon the personal inclination of the partners, there 
can be no specific performance of a partnership agreement (Scott v. Raymont, 1868, 7 Fq. 112). 
Suit for Libel or Slander 
A firm is merely a collection of partners and cannot bring a suit for libel or slander. Libel or slander against a 
firm imply a libel or slander of its partners. Such partners themselves or any one may  file the suit for libel or 
slander (P.K. Oswal Hosiery Mills v. Tilak Chand, AIR 1969, Punj. 150). 
LESSON ROUND-UP 
• The Indian Partnership Act, 1932 lays down the important provisions relating to partnership contracts. 
• According to Section 4 “Partnership is the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of 
a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all. 
• A partnership may either be for a particular adventure or for a fixed period. It may also be a partnership at 
will. 
• The minor  is incompetent  to contract  and, therefore,  partnership cannot  come into  existence if  the 
parties to a contract of partnership consist of one major and one minor. 
• Every partner is an agent of the firm and of other partners for the purpose of the business of the firm. 
• The authority of a partner means the capacity of a partner to bind the firm by his act. This authority may be 
express or implied. 
• All partners are liable jointly and severally for all acts or omissions binding on the firm including liabilities 
arising from contracts as well as torts. 
• The dissolution of partnership between all the partners of a firm is called the “Dissolution of the Firm”. 
• A dissolution does not necessarily follow because the partnership has ceased to do business, for the 
partnership may continue for the purpose of realising the assets.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Sale Exchange of  goods  and  services  is  the basis  
of  every  business  activity.  Goods are bought and 
sold for cash as well as on credit. All these 
transactions require flow of cash either immediately 
or after a certain time. In modern business, large 
number of transactions involving huge sums of 
money 
takes 
place 
every 
day. 
It 
is 
quite   
inconvenient as well as risky for either party to make 
and receive payments in cash. Therefore, it is a 
common practice for business men to make use of 
certain documents as means of making payment. 
Some of these documents are called negotiable 
instruments. But on the other hand, accepting 
payment using negotiable instruments is no less than 
a risky transaction since it involves deferred 
payments. 
In the light of this, the Negotiable Instruments Act 
was passed in 1881. There is no doubt that the Act is 
to regulate commercial transactions and was drafted 
to suit requirements of business conditions prevailing 
then. 
This lesson deals with the common provisions of  the  
mentioned  act,  which  has  played  an important  
role  in  increasing  commercial activities. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL 
596 
DEFINITION OF A NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT 
The law relating to negotiable instruments is contained in the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. It is an Act 
to define and amend the law relating to promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques. 
The Act does not affect the custom or local usage relating to an instrument in oriental language i.e., a Hundi. 
The term “negotiable instrument” means a document transferable from one person to another. However the 
Act has not defined the term. It merely says that “A negotiable instrument” means a promissory note, bill of 
exchange or cheque payable either to order or to bearer. [Section 13(1)] 
A negotiable instrument may be defined as “an instrument, the property in which is acquired by anyone who 
takes it bona fide, and for value, notwithstanding any defect of title in the person from whom he took it, from 
which it follows that an instrument cannot be negotiable unless it is such and in such a state that the true 
owner could transfer the contract or engagement contained therein by simple delivery of instrument” (Willis—
The Law of Negotiable Securities, Page 6). 
According to this definition the following are the conditions of negotiability: 
 
(i) The instrument should be freely transferable. An instrument cannot be negotiable unless it is such 
and in such state that the true owner could transfer by simple delivery or endorsement and delivery. 
 
(ii) The person who takes it for value and in good faith is not affected by the defect in the title of the 
transferor. 
 
(iii) Such a person can sue upon the instrument in his own name. 
Negotiability involves two elements namely, transferability free from equities and transferability by delivery or 
endorsement (Mookerjee J. In Tailors Priya v. Gulab Chand, AIR 1965 Cal). 
But the Act recognises only three types of instruments viz., a Promissory Note, a Bill of Exchange and a 
Cheque as negotiable instruments. However, it does not mean that other instruments are not negotiable 
instruments provided that they satisfy the following conditions of negotiability: 
 
1. The instrument should be freely transferable by the custom of trade. Transferability may be by (i) 
delivery or (ii) endorsement and delivery. 
 
2. The person who obtains it in good faith and for consideration gets it free from all defects and can 
sue upon it in his own name. 
 
3. The holder has the right to transfer.  The  negotiability  continues  till  the maturity. 
Effect of Negotiability 
The general principle of law relating to transfer of property is that no one can pass a better title than he 
himself has (nemodat quad non-habet). The exceptions to this general rule arise by virtue of statute or by a 
custom. A negotiable instrument is one such exception which is originally a creation of mercantile custom. 
Thus a bona fide transferee of negotiable instrument for consideration without notice of any defect of title, 
acquires the instrument free of any defect, i.e., he acquires a better title than that of the transferor. 
 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
597 
IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS OF NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS 
Following are the important characteristics of negotiable instruments: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Classification of Negotiable Instruments 
The negotiable instruments may be classified as under: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1) Bearer Instruments 
A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is payable to bearer when (i) it is expressed to be so payable, 
or (ii) the only or last endorsement on the instrument is an endorsement in blank. A person who is a holder of 
a bearer instrument can obtain the payment of the instrument. 
(2) Order Instruments 
A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is payable to order (i) which is expressed to be so payable; or 
(ii) which is expressed to be payable to a particular person, and does not contain any words prohibiting 
transfer or indicating an intention that it shall not be transferable. 
(3) Inland Instruments (Section 11) 
A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque drawn or made in India, and made payable, or drawn upon 
EP-EBCL 
598 
any person, resident in India shall be deemed to be an inland instrument. Since a promissory  note is not 
drawn on any person, an inland promissory  note is one which is made payable in India. Subject to this 
exception, an inland instrument is one which is either: 
 
(i) drawn and made payable in India, or 
 
(ii) drawn in India upon some persons resident therein, even though it is made payable in a foreign 
country. 
(4) Foreign Instruments 
An instrument which is not an inland instrument, is deemed to be a foreign instrument. The essentials of a 
foreign instrument include that: 
 
(i) it must be drawn outside India and made payable outside or inside India; or 
 
(ii) it must be drawn in India and made payable outside India and drawn on a person resident outside 
India. 
(5) Demand Instruments (Section 19) 
A promissory note or a bill of exchange in which no time for payment is specified is an instrument payable on 
demand. 
(6) Time Instruments 
Time instruments are those which are payable at sometime in the future. Therefore, a promissory note or a 
bill of exchange payable after a fixed period, or after sight, or on specified day, or on the happening of an 
event which is certain to happen, is known as a time instrument. The expression “after sight” in a promissory 
note means that the payment cannot be demanded on it unless it has been shown to the maker. In the case 
of bill of exchange, the expression “after sight” means after acceptance, or after noting for non-acceptance or 
after protest for non-acceptance. 
Ambiguous Instruments (Section 17) 
An instrument, which in form is such that it may either be treated by the holder as a bill or as a note, is an 
ambiguous instrument. Section 5(2) of the English Bills of Exchange Act provides that where in a bill, the 
drawer and the drawee are the same person or where the drawee is a fictitious person or a person 
incompetent to contract, the holder may treat the instrument, at his option, either as a bill of exchange or as a 
promissory note. 
Bill drawn to or to the order of the drawee or by an agent on his principal, or by one branch of a bank on 
another or by the direction of a company or their cashier are also ambiguous instruments. A promissory note 
addressed to a third person may be treated as a bill by such person by accepting it, while a bill not 
addressed to any one may be treated as a note. But where the drawer and payee are the same, e.g., where 
A draws a bill payable to A’s order, it is not an ambiguous instrument and cannot be treated as a promissory 
note. Once an instrument has been treated either as a bill or as a note, it cannot be treated differently 
afterwards. 
Inchoate or Incomplete Instrument (Section 20) 
When one person signs and delivers to another a paper stamped in accordance with the law relating to 
negotiable instruments, and either wholly blank or having written thereon an incomplete negotiable instrument, 
he thereby gives prima facie authority to the holder thereof to make or complete, as the case may be, upon it a 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
599 
negotiable instrument, for any amount specified therein, and not exceeding the amount, covered by the stamp. 
Such an instrument is called an inchoate instrument. The person so signing shall be liable upon such 
instrument, in the capacity in which he signs the same, to any holder in due course for such amount, provided 
that no person other than a holder in due course shall recover from the person delivering the instrument 
anything in excess of the amount intended by him to be paid thereon. 
The authority to fill up a blank or incomplete instrument may be exercised by any “holder” and not only the 
first holder to whom the instrument was delivered. The person signing and delivering the paper is liable both 
to a “holder” and a “holder-in-due- course”.  But there is a difference in their respective rights. A “holder” can 
recover only what the person signing and delivering the paper agreed to pay under the instrument, while a 
“holder-in- due-course” can recover the whole amount made payable by the instrument provided that it is 
covered by the stamp, even though the amount authorised was smaller. 
KINDS OF NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS 
The Act recognises only three kinds of negotiable instruments under Section 13 but it does not exclude any 
other negotiable instrument provided the instrument entitles a person to a sum of money and is transferable 
by delivery. Instruments written in oriental languages i.e. hundis are also negotiable instruments. These 
instruments are discussed below: 
(i)  Promissory Notes 
A “promissory note” is an instrument in writing (not being a bank note or a currency note) containing an 
unconditional undertaking, signed by the maker to pay a certain sum of money to, or to the order of, a certain 
person, or only to bearer of the instrument. (Section 4) 
Parties to a Promissory Note: 
A promissory note has the following parties: 
 
(a) The maker: the person who makes or executes the note promising to pay the amount stated therein. 
 
(b) The payee: one to whom the note is payable. 
 
(c) The holder: is either the payee or some other person to whom he may have endorsed the note. 
 
(d) The endorser. 
 
(e) The endorsee. 
Essentials of a Promissory Note: 
To be a promissory note, an instrument must possess the following essentials: 
 
(a) It must be in writing.  An oral promise to pay will not do. 
 
(b) It must contain an express promise or clear undertaking to pay. A promise to pay cannot be 
inferred. A mere acknowledgement of debt is not sufficient. If A writes to B “I owe you (I.O.U.) Rs. 
500", there is no promise to pay and the instrument is not a promissory note. 
 
(c) The promise or undertaking to pay must be unconditional. A promise to pay “when able”, or “as 
soon as possible”, or “after your marriage to D”, is conditional. But a promise to pay after a specific 
time or on the happening of an  event  which  must  happen,  is not conditional,  e.g.  “I promise to 
pay Rs. 1,000 ten days after the death of B”, is unconditional. 
 
(d) The maker must sign the promissory note in token of an undertaking to pay to the payee or his 
EP-EBCL 
600 
order. 
 
(e) The maker must be a certain person, i.e., the note must show clearly who is the person engaging 
himself to pay. 
 
(f) The payee must be certain. The promissory note must contain a promise to pay to some person or 
persons ascertained by name or designation or to their order. 
 
(g) The sum payable must be certain and the amount must not be capable of contingent additions or 
subtractions. If A promises to pay Rs. 100 and all other sums which shall become due to him, the 
instrument is not a promissory note. 
 
(h) Payment must be  in  legal money  of  the country.  Thus, a promise to pay Rs. 500 and deliver 10 
quintals of rice is not a promissory note. 
 
(i) It must be properly stamped in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Stamp Act. Each stamp 
must be duly cancelled by maker’s signature or initials. 
 
(j) It must contain the name of place, number and the date on which it is made. However, their 
omission will not render the instrument invalid, e.g. if it is undated, it is deemed to be dated on the 
date of delivery. 
 
 Note: A promissory note cannot be made payable or issued to bearer, no matter  whether  it is  
payable  on  demand  or  after  a certain time (Section 31 of the RBI Act). 
(ii) Bills of Exchange 
A “bill of exchange” is an instrument in writing containing an unconditional order, signed by the maker, 
directing a certain person to pay a certain sum of money only to or to the order of, a certain person or to the 
bearer of the instrument. (Section 5) 
The definition of a bill of exchange is very similar to that of a promissory note and for most of the cases the 
rules which apply to promissory notes are in general applicable to bills. There are however, certain important 
points of distinction between the two. 
Parties to bills of exchange 
The following are parties to a bill of exchange: 
 
(a) The Drawer: the person who draws the bill. 
 
(b) The Drawee: the person on whom the bill is drawn. 
 
(c) The Acceptor: one who accepts the bill. Generally, the drawee is the acceptor but a stranger may 
accept it on behalf of the drawee. 
 
(d) The payee: one to whom the sum stated in the bill is payable, either the drawer or any other person 
may be the payee. 
 
(e) The holder: is either the original payee or any other person to whom, the payee has endorsed the 
bill. In case of a bearer bill, the bearer is the holder. 
 
(f) The endorser: when the holder endorses the bill to any one else he becomes the endorser. 
 
(g) The endorsee: is the person to whom the bill is endorsed. 
 
(h) Drawee in case of need: Besides the above parties, another person called the “drawee in case of 
need”, may be introduced at the option of the drawer. The name of such a person may be inserted 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881

either by the drawer or by any endorser in order that resort may be had to him in case of need, i.e., 
when the bill is dishonoured by either non-acceptance or non-payment. 
 
(i) Acceptor for honour: Further, any person may voluntarily become a party to a bill as acceptor. A 
person, who on the refusal by the original drawee to accept the bill or to furnish better security, 
when demanded by the notary, accept the bill supra protest in order to safeguard the honour of the 
drawer or any endorser, is called the acceptor for honour. 
Essentials of a Bill of Exchange: 
 
(1) It must be in writing. 
 
(2) It must contain an unconditional order to pay money only and not merely a request. 
 
(3) It must be signed by the drawer. 
 
(4) The parties must be certain. 
 
(5) The sum payable must also be certain. 
 
(6) It must comply with other formalities e.g. stamps, date, etc. 
Distinction between Bill of Exchange and Promissory Note 
The following are the important points of distinction between a bill of exchange and a promissory note: 
 
(a) A promissory note is a two-party instrument, with a maker (debtor) and a payee (creditor). In a bill 
there are three parties—drawer, drawee and payee, though any two out of the three capacities may 
be filled by one and the same person. In a bill, the drawer is the maker who orders the drawee to 
pay the bill to a person called the payee or to his order. When the drawee accepts the bill he is 
called the acceptor. 
 
(b) A note cannot be made payable to the maker himself, while in a bill, the drawer and payee may be 
the same person. 
 
(c) A note contains an unconditional promise by the maker to pay to the payee or his order; in a bill 
there is an unconditional order to the drawee to pay according to the directions of the drawer. 
 
(d) A note is presented for payment without any prior acceptance by the maker. A bill payable after 
sight must be accepted by the drawee or someone else on his behalf before it can be presented for 
payment. 
 
(e) The liability of the maker of a pro-note is primary and absolute, but the liability of the drawer of a bill 
is secondary and conditional. 
 
(f) Foreign bill must be protested for dishonour but no such protest is necessary in the case of a note. 
 
(g) When a bill is dishonoured, due notice of dishonour is to be given by the holder to the drawer and 
the intermediate endorsee, but no such notice need to be given in the case of a note. 
 
(h) A bill can be drawn payable to bearer provided it is not payable on demand. A promissory note 
cannot be made payable to bearer, even if it is made payable otherwise than on demand. 
How Bill of Exchange Originates—Forms of Bills of Exchange 
Bills of exchange were originally used for payment of debts by traders residing in one country to another 
country with a view to avoid transmission of coin. Now-a-days they are used more as trade bills both in 
connection with domestic trade and foreign trade and are called inland bills and foreign bills respectively. 
EP-EBCL 
602 
Inland Bills (Sections 11 and 12) 
A bill of exchange is an inland instrument if it is (i) drawn or made and payable in India, or (ii) drawn in India 
upon any person who is a resident in India, even though it is made payable in a foreign country. But a 
promissory note to be an inland should be drawn and payable in India, as it has no drawee. 
Two essential conditions to make an inland instrument are: 
 
(1) the instrument must have been drawn or made in India; and 
 
(2) the instrument must be payable in India or the drawee must be in India. 
Examples: A bill drawn in India, payable in USA, upon a person in India is an inland instrument. A bill drawn 
in India and payable in India but drawn on a person in USA is also an inland instrument. 
Foreign Bills 
All bills which are not inland are deemed to be foreign bills. Normally foreign bills are drawn in sets of three 
copies. 
Trade Bill 
A bill drawn and accepted for a genuine trade transaction is termed as a trade bill. When a trader sells goods 
on credit, he may make use of a bill of exchange. Suppose A sells goods worth  Rs. 1,000 to B and allows him 
90 days time to pay  the price,  A will  draw  a  bill of exchange on B,  on the following terms:  “Ninety days after 
date pay A or order,  the sum of  one thousand rupees only for value received”.  A will sign the bill and then 
present it to B for acceptance. This is necessary because, until a bill is accepted by the drawee, nobody has 
either rights or obligations. If B agrees to obey the order of A, he will accept the bill by writing across its face the 
word “accepted” and signing his name underneath and then delivering the bill to the holder. B, the drawee, now 
becomes the acceptor of the bill and liable to its holders. Such a bill is a genuine trade bill. 
Accommodation Bill 
All bills are not genuine trade bills, as they are often drawn for accommodating a party. An accommodation 
bill is a bill in which a person lends or gives his name to oblige a friend or some person whom he knows or 
otherwise. In other words, a bill which is drawn, accepted or endorsed without consideration is called an 
accommodation bill. The party lending his name to oblige the other party is known as the accommodating or 
accommodation party, and the party so obliged is called the party accommodated. An accommodation party 
is not liable on the instrument to the party accommodated because as between them there was no 
consideration and the instrument was merely to help. But the accommodation party is liable to a holder for 
value, who takes the accommodation bill for value, though such holder may not be a holder in due course. 
Thus, A may be in need of money and approach his friends B and C who, instead of lending the money 
directly, propose to draw an “Accommodation Bill” in his favour in the following form: 
“Three months after date pay A or order, the sum of Rupees one thousand only”. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
B. 
To 
 
C. 
If the credit of B and C is good, this device enables A to get an advance of `1,000 from his banker at the 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
603 
commercial rate of discount. The real debtor in this case is not C, but A the payee who promises to 
reimburse C before the period of three months only. A is here the principal debtor and B and C are mere 
sureties. This inversion of liability affords a good definition of an accommodation bill: “If as between the 
original parties to the bill the one who should prima facie be principal is in fact the surety whether he be 
drawer, acceptor, or endorser, that bill is an accommodation bill”. 
Bills in Sets (Section 132 and 133) 
Foreign bills are usually drawn in sets to avoid  the danger of loss.  They are drawn in sets  of  three,  each 
of which is  called  “Via” and as  soon  as  any one of them is paid, the others become inoperative. All these 
parts form one bill and the drawer must sign and deliver all of them to the payee. The stamp is affixed only 
on one part and one part is required to be accepted. But if the drawer mistakenly accepts all the parts of the 
same bill, he will be liable on each part accepted as if it were a separate bill. 
Right to Duplicate Bill 
Where a bill of exchange has been lost before it was overdue, the person who was the holder to it may apply 
to the drawer, to give him another bill of the same tenor. It is only the holder who can ask for a duplicate bill, 
promissory note or cheque. 
Bank Draft 
A bill of exchange is also sometimes spoken of as a draft. It is called as a bank draft when a bill of exchange 
drawn by one bank on another bank, or by itself on its own branch, and is a negotiable instrument. It is very 
much like the cheque with three points of distinction between the two. A bank draft can be drawn only by a 
bank on another bank, usually its own branch. It cannot so easily be counter-manded. It cannot be made 
payable to bearer.

(iii) Cheques 
The Negotiable Instruments (Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2002 has broadened, the 
definition of cheque to include the electronic image of a truncated cheque and a cheque in the electronic 
form. Section 6 of the Act provides that a ‘cheque’ is a bill of exchange drawn on a specified banker and not 
EP-EBCL 
604 
expressed to be payable otherwise than on demand and it includes the electronic image of a truncated 
cheque and a cheque in the electronic form. 
Despite the amendment as is evident the basic definition of the cheque has been retained and the definition 
has only been enlarged to include cheques in the above form as well. 
As per explanation appended to the section, the expression: 
 
(i) ‘“a cheque in the electronic form” means a cheque drawn in electronic form by using any computer 
resource and signed in a secure system with digital signature (with or without biometrics signature) 
and asymmetric crypto system or with electronic signature, as the case may be; 
 
(ii) ‘a truncated cheque’ means a cheque which is truncated during the course of a clearing cycle, 
either by the clearing house or by the bank whether paying or receiving payment, immediately on 
generation of an electronic image for transmission, substituting the further physical movement of the 
cheque in writing. (Explanation I). 
The expression ‘clearing house’ means the clearing house managed by the Reserve Bank of India or a 
clearing house recognised as such by the Reserve Bank of India. (Explanation II). 
‘Explanation III. – For the purposes of this section, the expressions “asymmetric crypto system”, “computer 
resource”, “digital signature”, “electronic form” and “electronic signature” shall have the same meanings 
respectively assigned to them in the Information Technology Act, 2000.’ 
Simply stated, a cheque is a bill of exchange drawn on a bank payable always on demand. Thus, a cheque 
is a bill of exchange with two additional qualifications, namely: (i) it is always drawn on a banker, and (ii) it is 
always payable on demand. A cheque being a species of a bill of exchange, must satisfy all the requirements 
of a bill; it does not, however, require acceptance. 
Note: By virtue of Section 31 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, no bill of exchange or hundi can be made 
payable to bearer on demand and no promissory note or a bank draft can be made payable to bearer at all, 
whether on demand or after a specified time. Only a cheque can be payable to bearer on demand. 
Parties to a cheque 
The following are the parties to a cheque: 
 
(a) The drawer: The person who draws the cheque. 
 
(b) The drawee: The banker of the drawer on whom the cheque is drawn. 
 
(c), (d), (e) and (f) The payee, holder, endorser and endorsee: same as in the case of a bill. 
Essentials of a Cheque 
 
(1) It is always drawn on a banker. 
 
(2) It is always payable on demand. 
 
(3) It does not require acceptance. There is, however, a custom among banks to mark cheques as 
good for purposes of clearance. 
 
(4) A cheque can be drawn on bank where the drawer has an account. 
 
(5) Cheques may be payable to the drawer himself. It may be made payable to bearer on demand 
unlike a bill or a note. 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
605 
 
(6) The banker is liable only to the drawer. A holder has no remedy against the banker if a cheque is 
dishonoured. 
 
(7) A cheque is usually valid for fix months. However, it is not invalid if it is post dated or ante-dated. 
 
(8) No Stamp is required to be affixed on cheques. 
Distinction between Cheques and Bills of Exchange 
As a general rule, the provisions applicable to bills payable on demand apply to cheques, yet there are few 
points of distinction between the two, namely: 
 
(a) A cheque is a bill of exchange and always drawn on a banker, while a bill may be drawn on any 
one, including banker. 
 
(b) A cheque can only be drawn payable on demand, a bill may be drawn payable on demand, or on 
the expiry of a specified period after sight or date. 
 
(c) A bill payable after sight must be accepted before payment can be demanded, a cheque does not 
require acceptance and is intended for immediate payment. 
 
(d) A grace of 3 days is allowed in the case of time bills, while no grace is given in the case of a 
cheque, for payment. 
 
(e) The drawer of a bill is discharged, if it is not presented for payment, but the drawer of a cheque is 
discharged only if he suffers any damage by delay in presentment for payment. 
 
(f) Notice of the dishonour of a bill is necessary, but not in the case of a cheque. 
 
(g) The cheque being a revocable mandate, the authority may be revoked by countermanding payment, 
and is determined by notice of the customer’s death or insolvency. This is not so in the case of bill. 
 
(h) A cheque may be crossed, but not a bill. 
A cheque is a bill of exchange drawn on a specified banker and always payable on demand. A cheque is 
always drawn on a particular banker and is always payable on demand. Consequently, all cheques are bills 
of exchange but all bills are not cheques.

Banker 
A banker is one who does banking business. Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 defines 
banking as, “accepting for the purpose of lending or investment, of deposits of money from the public, 
repayable on demand or otherwise and withdrawable by cheque, draft or otherwise.”  This definition 
EP-EBCL 
606 
emphasises two points: (1) that the primary function of a banker consists of accepting of deposits for the 
purpose of lending or investing the same; (2) that the amount deposited is repayable to the depositor on 
demand or according to the agreement. The demand for repayment can be made through a cheque, draft or 
otherwise, and not merely by verbal order.  
Customer 
The term “customer” is neither defined in Indian nor in English statutes. The general opinion is that a 
customer is one who has an account with the bank or who utilises the services of the bank. 
The special features of the legal relationship between the banker and the customer may be termed as the 
obligations and rights of the banker. These are: 
 
1. Obligation to honour cheques of the customers. 
 
2. Obligation to collect cheques and drafts on behalf of the customers. 
 
3. Obligation to keep proper record of transactions with the customer. 
 
4. Obligation to comply with the express standing instructions of the customer. 
 
5. Obligation not to disclose the state of customer’s account to anyone else. 
 
6. Obligation to give reasonable notice to the customer, if the banker wishes to close the account. 
 
7. Right of lien over any goods and securities bailed to him for a general balance of account. 
 
8. Right of set off and right of appropriation. 
 
9. Right to claim incidental charges and interest as per rules and regulations of the bank, as 
communicated to the customer  at  the time of opening the account. 
Liability of a Banker 
By opening a current account of a customer, the banker becomes liable to his debtor to the extent of the 
amount so received in the said account and undertakes to honour the cheques drawn by the customer so 
long as he holds sufficient funds to the customer’s credit. If a banker, without justification, fails to honour his 
customer’s cheques, he is liable to compensate the drawer for any loss or damage suffered by him. But the 
payee or holder of the cheque has no cause of action against the banker as the obligation to honour a 
cheque is only towards the drawer. 
The banker must also maintain proper and accurate accounts of credits and debits.  He must honour a 
cheque presented in due course.  But in the following circumstances, he must refuse to honour a cheque and 
in some others he may do so. 
When Banker must Refuse Payment 
In the following cases the authority of the banker to honour customer’s cheque comes to an end, he must 
refuse to honour cheques issued by the customer: 
 
(a) When a customer countermands payment i.e., where or when a customer, after issuing a cheque 
issues instructions not to honour it, the banker must not pay it. 
 
(b) When the banker receives notice of customer’s death. 
 
(c) When customer has been adjudged an insolvent. 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
607 
 
(d) When the banker receives notice of customer’s insanity. 
 
(e) When an order (e.g., Garnishee Order) of the Court, prohibits payment. 
 
(f) When the customer has given notice of assignment of the credit balance of his account. 
 
(g) When the holder’s title is defective and the banker comes to know of it. 
 
(h) When the customer has given notice for closing his account. 
When Banker may Refuse Payment 
In the following cases the banker may refuse to pay a customer’s cheque: 
 
(a) When the cheque is post-dated. 
 
(b) When the banker has no sufficient funds of the drawer with him and there is no communication 
between the bank and the customer to honour the cheque. 
 
(c) When the cheque is of doubtful legality. 
 
(d) When the cheque is not duly presented, e.g., it is presented after banking hours. 
 
(e) When the cheque on the face of it is irregular, ambiguous or otherwise materially altered. 
 
(f) When the cheque is presented at a branch where the customer has no account. 
 
(g) When some persons have joint account and the cheque is not signed jointly by all or by the 
survivors of them. 
 
(h) When the cheque has been allowed to become stale, i.e., it has not been presented within six 
months of the date mentioned on it. 
Protection of Paying Banker (Sections 10, 85 and 128) 
Section 85 lays down that where a cheque payable to order purports to be endorsed by or on behalf of the 
payee the banker is discharged by payment in due course. He can debit the account of the customer with the 
amount even though the endorsement turns out subsequently to have been forged, or the agent of the payee 
without authority endorsed it on behalf of the payee. It would be seen that the payee includes endorsee. This 
protection is granted because a banker cannot be expected to know the signatures of all the persons in the 
world. He is only bound to know the signatures of his own customers. 
Therefore, the forgery of drawer’s signature will not ordinarily protect the banker but even in this case, the 
banker may debit the account of the customer, if it can show that the forgery was intimately connected with 
the negligence of the customer and was the proximate cause of loss. 
In the case of bearer cheques, the rule is that once a bearer cheque, always a bearer cheque. Where, 
therefore, a cheque originally expressed by the drawer himself to be payable to bearer, the banker may 
ignore any endorsement on the cheque. He will be discharged by payment in due course. But a cheque 
which becomes bearer by a subsequent endorsement in blank is not covered by this Section. A banker is 
discharged from liability on a crossed cheque if he makes payment in due course. 
Payment in due Course (Section 10) 
Any person liable to make payment under a negotiable instrument, must make the payment of the amount 
due thereunder in due course in order to obtain a valid discharge against the holder. 
A payment in due course means a payment in accordance with the apparent tenor of the instrument, in good 
EP-EBCL 
608 
faith and without negligence to any person in possession thereof. 
A payment will be a payment in due course if: 
 
(a) it is in accordance with the apparent tenor of the instrument, i.e., according to what appears on the 
face of the instrument to be the intention of the parties; 
 
(b) it is made in good faith and without negligence, and under circumstances which do not afford a 
ground for believing that the person to whom it is made is not entitled to receive the amount; 
 
(c) it is made to the person in possession of the instrument who is entitled as holder to receive 
payment; 
 
(d) payment is made under circumstances which do not afford a reasonable ground believing that he is 
not entitled to receive payment of the amount mentioned in the instrument; and 
 
(e) payment is made in money and money only. 
Under Sections 10 and 128, a paying banker making payment in due course is protected. 
Collecting Banker 
Collecting Banker is one who collects the proceeds of a cheque for a customer. Although a banker collects 
the proceeds of a cheque for a customer purely as a matter of service, yet the Negotiable Instruments Act, 
1881 indirectly imposes statutory obligation, statutory in nature. This is evident from Section 126 of the Act 
which provides that a cheque bearing a “general crossing” shall not be paid to anyone other than banker and 
a cheque which is “specially crossed” shall not be paid to a person other than the banker to whom it is 
crossed. Thus, a paying banker must pay a generally crossed cheque only to a banker thereby meaning that 
it should be collected by another banker. While so collecting the cheques for a customer, it is quite possible 
that the banker collects for a customer, proceeds of a cheque to which the customer had no title in fact. In 
such cases, the true owner may sue the collecting banker for “conversion”. At the same time, it cannot be 
expected of a banker to know or to ensure that all the signatures appearing in endorsements on the reverse 
of the cheque are genuine. The banker is expected to be conversant only with the signatures of his 
customer. A customer to whom a cheque has been endorsed, would request his banker to collect a cheque. 
In the event of the endorser’s signature being proved to be forged at later date, the banker who collected the 
proceeds should not be held liable for the simple reason that he has merely collected the proceeds of a 
cheque. Section 131 of the Negotiable Instruments Act affords statutory protection in such a case where the 
customer’s title to the cheque which the banker has collected has been questioned. It reads as follows: 
“A banker who has in good faith and without negligence received payment for a customer of a cheque 
crossed generally or specially to himself shall not, in case the title to the cheque proves defective, incur any 
liability to the true owner of the cheque by reason of only having received such payment. 
Explanation: A banker receives payment of a crossed cheque for a customer within the meaning of this 
section notwithstanding that he credits his customer’s account with the amount of the cheque before 
receiving payment thereof." 
The Amendment Act, 2002 has added a new explanation to Section 131 which provides that it shall be the duty 
of the banker who receives payment based on an electronic image of a truncated cheque held with him, to 
verify the prima facie genuineness of the cheque to be truncated and any fraud, forgery or tampering apparent 
on the face of the instrument that can be verified with due diligence and ordinary care. (Explanation II) 
The requisites of claiming protection under Section 131 are as follows: 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
609 
 
(i) The collecting banker should have acted in good faith and without negligence. An act is done in 
good faith when it is done honestly. The plea of good faith can be rebutted on the ground of 
recklessness indicative of want of proper care and attention. Therefore, much depends upon the 
facts of the case. The burden of proving that the cheque was collected in good faith and without 
negligence is upon the banker claiming protection. Failure to verify the regularity of endorsements, 
collecting a cheque payable to the account of the company to the credit of the director, etc. are 
examples of negligence. 
 
(ii) The banker should have collected a crossed cheque, i.e., the cheque should have been crossed 
before it came to him for collection. 
 
(iii) The proceeds should have been collected for a customer, i.e., a person who has an account with 
him. 
 
(iv) That the collecting banker has only acted as an agent of the customer. If he had become the holder 
for value, the protection available under Section 131 is forfeited—Where for instance, the banker 
allows the customer to withdraw the amount of the cheque before the cheque is collected or where 
the cheque has been accepted in specific reduction of an overdraft, the banker is deemed to have 
become the holder for value and the protection is lost. But the explanation to Section 131 says that 
the mere crediting of the amount to the account does not imply that the banker has  become  a 
holder for value because due to accounting conveniences the banker may credit the account of the 
cheque to the customer’s account even before proceeds thereof are realised. 
Overdue, Stale or Out-of-date Cheques 
A cheque is overdue or becomes statute-barred after three years from its due date of issue. A holder cannot 
sue on the cheque after that time. Apart from this provision, the holder of a cheque is required to present it 
for payment within a reasonable time, as a cheque is not meant for indefinite circulation. In India, a cheque, 
which has been in circulation for more than six months, is regarded by bankers as stale. If, as a result of any 
delay in presenting a cheque, the drawer suffers any loss, as by the failure of the bank, the drawer is 
discharged from liability to the holder to the extent of the damage. 
Liability of Endorser 
In order to charge an endorser, it is necessary to present the cheque for payment within a reasonable time of 
its delivery by such endorser. ‘A’ endorses and delivers a cheque to B, and B keeps it for an unreasonable 
length of time, and then endorses and delivers it to C. C presents it for payment within a reasonable time 
after its receipt by him, and it is dishonoured. C can enforce payment against B but not against A, as qua A, 
the cheque has become stale. 
Rights of Holder against Banker 
A banker is liable to his customer for wrongful dishonour of his cheque but it is not liable to the payee or 
holder of the cheque. The holder has no right to enforce payment from the banker except in two cases, 
namely, (i) where the holder does not present the cheque within a reasonable time after issue, and as a 
result the drawer suffers damage by the failure of the banker in liquidation proceedings; and (ii) where a 
banker pays a crossed cheque by mistake over the counter, he is liable to the owner for any loss occasioned 
by it. 
Crossing of Cheques 
A cheque is either “open” or “crossed”. An open cheque can be presented by the payee to the paying banker 
and is paid over the counter. A crossed cheque cannot be paid across the counter but must be collected 
through a banker. 
EP-EBCL 
610 
A crossing is a direction to the  paying  banker  to  pay  the  money generally to a banker or to a particular 
banker, and not to pay otherwise. The object of crossing is  to  secure  payment  to  a  banker  so  that  it  
could be  traced to the person receiving the amount of the cheque. Crossing is a direction to the paying 
banker that the cheque should be paid only to a banker or a specified banker. To restrain negotiability, 
addition of words “Not Negotiable” or “Account Payee Only” is necessary. A crossed bearer cheque can be 
negotiated by delivery and crossed order cheque by endorsement and delivery. Crossing affords security 
and protection to the holder of the cheque. 
Modes of Crossing (Sections 123-131A) 
There are two types of crossing which may be used on cheque, namely: (i) General, and (ii) Special. To 
these may be added another type, i.e. Restrictive crossing. 
It is general crossing where a cheque bears across its face an addition of two parallel transverse lines and/or 
the addition of the words “and Co.” between them, or addition of “not negotiable”. As stated earlier, where a 
cheque is crossed generally, the paying banker will pay to any banker. Two transverse parallel lines are 
essential for a general crossing (Sections 123-126). 
In case of general crossing, the holder or payee cannot get the payment over the counter of the bank but 
through a bank only. The addition of the words “and Co.” do not have any significance but the addition of the 
words “not negotiable” restrict the negotiability of the cheque and in case of transfer, the transferee will not 
give a better title than that of a transferor. 
Where a cheque bears across its face an addition of the name of a banker, either with or without the words 
“not negotiable” that addition constitutes a crossing and the cheque is crossed specially and to that banker. 
The paying banker will pay only to the banker whose name appears across the cheque, or to his collecting 
agent. Parallel transverse lines are not essential but the name of the banker is the insignia of a special 
crossing. 
In case of special crossing, the paying banker is to honour the cheque only when it is prescribed through the 
bank mentioned in the crossing or it’s agent bank. 
Account Payee’s Crossing: Such crossing does, in practice, restrict negotiability of a cheque. It warns the 
collecting banker that the proceeds are to be credited only to the account of the payee, or the party named, 
or his agent. If the collecting banker allows the proceeds of a cheque bearing such crossing to be credited to 
any other account, he will be guilty of negligence and will not be entitled to the protection given to collecting 
banker under Section 131.  Such crossing does not affect the paying banker, who is under no duty to 
ascertain that the cheque is in fact collected for the account of the person named as payee. 
Not Negotiable Crossing 
A cheque may be crossed not negotiable by writing across the face of the cheque the words “Not Negotiable” 
within two transverse parallel lines in the case of a general crossing or alongwith the name of a banker in the 
case of a special crossing. Section 130 of the Negotiable Instruments Act provides “A person taking a 
cheque crossed generally or specially bearing in either case with the words ”not negotiable" shall not have 
and shall not be capable of giving, a better title to the cheque than that which the person from whom he took 
it had". The crossing of cheque “not negotiable” does not mean that it is non-transferable. It only deprives the 
instrument of the incident of negotiability. Normally speaking, the essential feature of a negotiable instrument 
as opposed to chattels is that a person who takes the instrument in good faith, without negligence, for value, 
before maturity and without knowledge of the defect in the title of the transferor, gets a good title to the 
instrument. In other words, he is called a holder in due course who acquires an indisputable title to the 
cheque. (When the instrument passes through a holder-in-due course, it is purged of all defects and the 
subsequent holders also get good title). It is exactly this important feature which is taken away by crossing 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
611 
the cheque “not negotiable”. In other words, a cheque crossed “not negotiable” is like any other chattel and 
therefore the transferee gets same title to the cheque which his transferor had.  That is to say that the 
transferee cannot claim the rights of a holder-in-due-course. So long as the title of the transferors is good, 
the title of the transferees is also good but if there is a taint in the title to the cheque of one of the endorsers, 
then all the subsequent transferees’ title also become tainted with the same defect they cannot claim to be 
holders-in-due-course. 
The object of this Section is to afford protection to the drawer or holder of a cheque who is desirous of 
transmitting it to another person, as much protection as can reasonably be afforded to him against 
dishonestly or actual miscarriage in the course of transit. For example, a cheque payable to bearer is 
crossed generally and is marked “not negotiable”. It is lost or stolen and comes into the possession of X who 
takes it in good faith and gives value for it, X collects the cheque through his bank and paying banker also 
pays. In this case, both the paying and the collecting bankers are protected under Sections 128 and 131 
respectively. But X cannot claim that he is a holder-in-due course which he could have under the normal 
circumstances claimed. The reason is that cheque is crossed “not negotiable” and hence the true owner’s 
(holder’s) right supercedes the rights of the holder-in-due-course. Since X obtained the cheque from a 
person who had no title to the cheque (i.e. from one whose title was defective) X can claim no better title 
solely because the cheque was crossed “not negotiable” and not for any other reason. Thus “not negotiable” 
crossing not only protects the rights of the true owner of the cheque but also serves as a warning to the 
endorsees’ to enquire thoroughly before taking the cheque as they may have to be answerable to the true 
owner thereof if the endorser’s title is found to be defective. 
“Not negotiable” restricts the negotiability of the cheque and in case of transfer, the transferee will not get a 
better title than that of a transferor. 
If the cheque becomes “not negotiable” it lacks negotiability. A cheque crossed specially or generally bearing 
the words “not negotiable”, lacks negotiability and therefore is not a negotiable instrument in the true sense. 
It does not restrict transferability but restricts negotiability only.

Maturity 
Cheques are always payable on demand but other instruments like bills, notes, etc. may be made payable 
on a specified date or after the specified period of time. The date on which payment of an instrument falls 
due is called its maturity. According to Section 22 of the Act, “the maturity of a promissory note or a bill of 
exchange is the date at which it falls due”. According to Section 21 a promissory note or bill of exchange 
payable “at sight” or “on presentment” is payable on demand. It is due for payment as soon as it is issued. 
The question of maturity, therefore, arises only in the case of a promissory note or a bill of exchange payable 
“after date” or “after sight” or at a certain period after the happening of an event which is certain to happen. 
Maturity is the date on which the payment of an instrument falls due. Every instrument payable at a specified 
period after date or after sight is entitled to three days of grace. Such a bill or note matures or falls due on 
the last day of the grace period, and must be presented for payment on that day and if dishonoured, suit can 
be instituted on the next day after maturity. If an instrument is payable by instalments, each instalment is 
entitled to three days of grace. No days of grace are allowed for cheques, as they are payable on demand. 
Where a note or bill is expressed to be payable on the expiry of specified number of months after sight, or 
after date, the period of payment terminates on the day of the month which corresponds with the date of 
instrument, or with the date of acceptance if the bill be accepted or presented for sight, or noted or protested 
for non-acceptance. If the month in which the period would terminate has no corresponding day, the period 
shall be held to terminate on the last day of such month. 
Illustrations 
 
(i) A negotiable instrument dated 31st January, 2001, is made payable at one months after date. The 
instrument is at maturity on the third day after the 28th February, 2001, i.e. on 3rd March, 2001. 
 
(ii) A negotiable instrument dated 30th August, 2001, is made payable three months after date. The 
instrument is at maturity on 3rd December, 2001. 
 
(iii) A negotiable instrument dated the 31st August, 2001, is made payable three months after date. The 
instrument is at maturity on 3rd December, 2001. 
If the day of maturity falls on a public holiday, the instrument is payable on the preceeding business day. 
Thus, if a bill is at maturity on a Sunday. It will be deemed due on Saturday and not on Monday. 
The ascertainment of the date of maturity becomes important because all these instruments must be 
presented for payment on the last day of grace and their payment cannot be demanded before that date. 
Where an instrument is payable by instalments, it must be presented for payment on the third day after the 
day fixed for the payment of each instalment. 
Holder 
According to Section 8 of the Act a person is a holder of a negotiable instrument who is entitled in his own 
name (i) to the possession of the instrument, and (ii) to recover or receive its amount from the parties 
thereto. It is not every person in possession of the instrument who is called a holder. To be a holder, the 
person must be named in the instrument as the payee, or the endorsee, or he must be the bearer thereof. A 
person who has obtained possession of an instrument by theft, or under a forged endorsement, is not a 
holder, as he is not entitled to recover the instrument. The holder implies de jure (holder in law) holder and 
not de facto (holder in fact) holder. An agent holding an instrument for his principal is not a holder although 
he may receive its payment. 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
613 
Holder in Due Course 
Section 9 states that a holder in due course is (i) a person who for consideration, obtains possession of a 
negotiable instrument if payable to bearer, or (ii) the payee or endorsee thereof, if payable to order, before its 
maturity and without having sufficient cause to believe that any defect existed in the title of the person from 
whom he derived his title. 
In order to be a holder in due course, a person must satisfy the following conditions: 
 
(i) He must be the holder of the instrument. 
 
(ii) He should have obtained the instrument for value or consideration. 
 
(iii) He must have obtained the negotiable instrument before maturity. 
 
(iv) The instrument should be complete and regular on the face of it. 
 
(v) The holder should take the instrument in good faith. 
A holder in due course is in a privileged position. He is not only himself protected against all defects of the 
persons from whom he received the instrument as current coin, but also serves as a channel to protect all 
subsequent holders. A holder in due course can recover the amount of the instrument from all previous 
parties, although, as a matter of fact, no consideration was paid by some of the previous parties to the 
instrument or there was a defect of title in the party from whom he took it. Once an instrument passes 
through the hands of a holder in due course, it is purged of all defects. It is like current coin. Whoever takes it 
can recover the amount from all parties previous to such holder. 
Capacity of Parties 
Capacity to incur liability as a party to a negotiable instrument is co-extensive with capacity to contract. 
According to Section 26, every person capable of contracting according to law to which he is subject, may 
bind himself and be bound by making, drawing, acceptance, endorsement, delivery and negotiation of a 
promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque. 
Negatively, minors, lunatics, idiots, drunken person and persons otherwise disqualified by their personal law, 
do not incur any liability as parties to negotiable instruments. But incapacity of one or more of the parties to a 
negotiable instrument in no way, diminishes the abilities and the liabilities of the competent parties. Where a 
minor is the endorser or payee of an instrument which has been endorsed all the parties accepting the minor 
are liable in the event of its dishonour. 
Liability of Parties 
The provisions regarding the liability of parties to negotiable instruments are laid down in Sections 30 to 32 
and 35 to 42 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. These provisions are as follows: 
1. Liability of Drawer (Section 30) 
The drawer of a bill of exchange or cheque is bound, in case of dishonour by the drawee or acceptor thereof, 
to compensate the holder, provided due notice of dishonour has been given to or received by the drawer. 
The nature of drawer’s liability is that by drawing a bill, he undertakes that (i) on due presentation, it shall be 
accepted and paid according to its tenor, and (ii) in case of dishonour, he will compensate the holder or any 
endorser, provided notice of dishonour has been duly given. However, in case of accommodation bill no 
notice of dishonour to the drawer is required. 
EP-EBCL 
614 
The liability of a drawer of a bill of exchange is secondary and arises only on default of the drawee, who is 
primarily liable to make payment of the negotiable instrument. 
2. Liability of the Drawee of Cheque (Section 31) 
The drawee of a cheque having sufficient funds of the drawer in his hands properly applicable to the 
payment of such cheque must pay the cheque when duly required to do so and, or in default of such 
payment, he shall compensate the drawer for any loss or damage caused by such default. 
As a cheque is a bill of exchange, drawn on a specified banker, the drawee of a cheque must always be a 
banker. The banker, therefore, is bound to pay the cheque of the drawer, i.e., customer, if the following 
conditions are satisfied: 
 
(i) The banker has sufficient funds to the credit of customer’s account. 
 
(ii) The funds are properly applicable to the payment of such cheque, e.g., the funds are not under any 
kind of lien etc. 
 
(iii) The cheque is duly required to be paid, during banking hours and on or after the date on which it is 
made payable. 
If the banker is unjustified in refusing to honour the cheque of its customer, it shall be liable for damages. 
3. Liability of “Maker” of Note and “Acceptor” of Bill (Section 32) 
In the absence of a contract to the contrary, the maker of a promissory note and the acceptor before maturity 
of a bill of exchange are bound to pay the amount thereof at maturity, according to the apparent tenor of the 
note or acceptance respectively. The acceptor of a bill of exchange at or after maturity is bound to pay the 
amount thereof to the holder on demand. 
It follows that the liability of the acceptor of a bill corresponds to that of the maker of a note and is absolute 
and unconditional but the liability under this Section is subject to a contract to the contrary (e.g., as in the 
case of accommodation bills) and may be excluded or modified by a collateral agreement. Further, the 
payment must be made to the party named in the instrument and not to any-one else, and it must be made at 
maturity and not before. 
4. Liability of endorser (Section 35) 
Every endorser incurs liability to the parties that are subsequent to him. Whoever endorses and delivers a 
negotiable instrument before maturity is bound thereby to every subsequent holder in case of dishonour of the 
instrument by the drawee, acceptor or maker, to compensate such holder of any loss or damage caused to him by 
such dishonour provided (i) there is no contract to the contrary; (ii) he (endorser) has not expressly excluded, 
limited or made conditional his own liability; and (iii) due notice of dishonour has been given to, or received by, 
such endorser. Every endorser after dishonour, is liable upon the instrument as if it is payable on demand. 
He is bound by his endorsement notwithstanding any previous alteration of the instrument. (Section 88) 
5. Liability of Prior Parties (Section 36) 
Every prior party to a negotiable instrument is liable thereon to a holder in due course until the instrument is 
duly satisfied. Prior parties may include the maker or drawer, the acceptor and all the intervening endorsers 
to a negotiable instrument. The liability of the prior parties to a holder in due course is joint and several. The 
holder in due course may hold any or all prior parties liable for the amount of the dishonoured instrument. 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
615 
6. Liability inter se 
Various parties to a negotiable instrument who are liable thereon stand on a different footing with respect to 
the nature of liability of each one of them. 
7. Liability of Acceptor of Forged Endorsement (Section 41) 
An acceptor of a bill of exchange already endorsed is not relieved from liability by reason that such 
endorsement is forged, if he knew or had reason to believe the endorsement to be forged when he accepted 
the bill. 
8. Acceptor’s Liability on a Bill drawn in a Fictitious Name 
An acceptor of a bill of exchange drawn in a fictitious name and payable to the drawer’s order is not, by 
reason that such name is fictitious, relieved from liability to any holder in due course claiming under an 
endorsement by the same hand as the drawer’s signature, and purporting to be made by the drawer. 
Negotiation (Section 14) 
A negotiable instrument may be transferred by negotiation or assignment. Negotiation is the transfer of an 
instrument (a note, bill or cheque) for one person to another in such a manner as to convey title and to 
constitute the transferee the holder thereof.  When a negotiable instrument is transferred by negotiation, the 
rights of the transferee may rise higher than those of the transferor, depending upon the circumstances 
attending the negotiation. When the transfer is made by assignment, the assignee has only those rights 
which the assignor possessed. In case of assignment, there is a transfer of ownership by means of a written 
and registered document. 
Negotiability and Assignability Distinguished 
A transfer by negotiation differs from transfer by assignment in the following respects: 
 
(a) Negotiation requires mere delivery of a bearer instrument and endorsement and delivery of an order 
instrument to effectuate a transfer. Assignment requires a written document signed by the 
transferor. 
 
(b) Notice of transfer of debt (actionable claim) must be given by the assignee to the debtor in order to 
complete his title; no such notice is necessary in a transfer by negotiation. 
 
(c) On assignment, the transferee of an actionable claim takes it subject to all the defects in the title of, 
and subject to all the equities and defences available against the assignor, even though he took the 
assignment for value and in good faith. In case of negotiation the transferee, as holder-in-due 
course, takes the instrument free from any defects in the title of the transferor. 
Importance of Delivery 
Negotiation is effected by mere delivery of a bearer instrument and by endorsement and delivery of an order 
instrument. This shows that “delivery” is essential in negotiable instruments. Section 46 expressly provides 
that making acceptance or endorsement of negotiable instrument is not complete until delivery, actual or 
constructive, of the instrument. Delivery made voluntarily with the intention of passing property in the 
instrument to the person to whom it is given is essential. 
Negotiation by Mere Delivery 
A bill or cheque payable to bearer is negotiated by mere delivery of the instrument. An instrument is payable 
EP-EBCL 
616 
to bearer: 
 
(i) Where it is made so payable, or 
 
(ii) Where it is originally made payable to order but the only or the last endorsement is in blank. 
 
(iii) Where the payee is a fictitious or a non-existing person. 
These instruments do not require signature of the transferor. The person who takes them is a holder, and 
can sue in his own name on them. Where a bearer negotiates an instrument by mere delivery, and does not 
put his signature thereon, he is not liable to any party to the instrument in case the instrument is 
dishonoured, as he has not lent his credit to it. His obligations are only towards his immediate transferee and 
to no other holders. 
A cheque, originally drawn payable to bearer remains bearer, even though it is subsequently endorsed in full. 
The rule is once a bearer cheque always a bearer cheque. 
Negotiation by Endorsement and Delivery 
An instrument payable to a specified person or to the order of a specified person or to a specified person or 
order is an instrument payable to order. Such an instrument can be negotiated only by endorsement and 
delivery. Unless the holder signs his endorsement on the instrument, the transferee does not become a 
holder. Where an instrument payable to order is delivered without endorsement, it is merely assigned and 
not negotiated and the holder thereof is not entitled to the rights of a holder in due course, and he cannot 
negotiate it to a third person. 
Endorsement (Sections 15 and 16) 
Where the maker or holder of a negotiable instrument signs the same otherwise than as such maker for the 
purpose of negotiation, on the back or face thereof or on a slip of paper annexed thereto (called Allonge), or 
so, signs for the same purpose, a stamped paper intended to be completed as a negotiable instrument, he is 
said to endorse the same (Section 15), the person to whom the instrument is endorsed is called the 
endorsee. 
In other words, ‘endorsement’ means and involves the writing of something on the back of an instrument for 
the purpose of transferring the right, title and interest therein to some other person. 
Classes of endorsement 
An endorsement may be (a) Blank or General, (b) Special or Full, (c) Restrictive, or (d) Partial, and (e) 
Conditional or Qualified. 
 
(a) Blank or General: An endorsement is to be blank or general where the endorser merely writes his 
signature on the back of the instrument, and the instrument so endorsed becomes payable to 
bearer, even though originally it was payable to order. Thus, where bill is payable to “Mohan or 
order”, and he writes on its back “Mohan”, it is an endorsement in blank by Mohan and the property 
in the bill can pass by mere delivery, as long as the endorsement continues to be a blank. But a 
holder of an instrument endorsed in blank may convert the endorsement in blank into an 
endorsement in full, by writing above the endorser’s signature, a direction to pay the instrument to 
another person or his order. 
 
(b) Special or Full: If the endorser signs his name and adds a direction to pay the amount mentioned in 
the instrument to, or to the order of a specified person, the endorsement is said to be special or in 
full. A bill made payable to Mohan or Mohan or order, and endorsed “pay to the order of Sohan” 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
617 
would be specially endorsed and Sohan endorses it further. A blank endorsement can be turned 
into a special one by the addition of an order making the bill payable to the transferee. 
 
(c) Restrictive: An endorsement is restrictive which prohibits or restricts the further negotiation of an 
instrument. Examples of restrictive endorsement: “Pay A only” or “Pay A for my use” or “Pay A on 
account of B” or “Pay A or order for collection”. 
 
(d) Partial: An endorsement partial is one which purports to transfer to the endorsee a part only of the 
amount payable on the instrument. A partial endorsement does not operate as negotiation of the 
instrument. A holds a bill for Rs. 1,000 and endorses it as “Pay B or order Rs. 500". The 
endorsement is partial and invalid. 
 
(e) Conditional or qualified: An endorsement is conditional or qualified which limits or negatives the 
liability of the endorser. An endorser may limit his liability in any of the following ways: 
 
(i) By sans recourse endorsement, i.e. by making it clear that he does not incur the liability of an 
endorser to the endorsee or subsequent holders and they should not look to him in case of 
dishonour of instrument. The endorser excludes his liability by adding the words “sans recourse” 
or “without recourse”, e.g., “pay A or order sans recourse”. 
 
(ii) By making his liability depending upon happening of a specified event which may never happen, 
e.g., the holder of a bill may endorse it thus: “Pay A or order on his marrying B”. In such a case, 
the endorser will not be liable until A marries B. 
It is pertinent to refer to Section 52 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 here. It reads “The endorser of a 
negotiable instrument may, by express words in the endorsement exclude his own liability thereon, or make 
such liability or the right of the endorsee to receive the amount due thereon depend upon the happening of a 
specified event, although such event may never happen”. 
Negotiation Back 
Where an endorser negotiates an instrument and again becomes its holder, the instrument is said to be 
negotiated back to that endorser and none of the intermediary endorsees are then liable to him. The rule 
prevents a circuity of action.  For example, A, the holder of a bill endorses it to B, B endorses to C, and C to 
D, and endorses it again to A. A, being a holder in due course of the bill by second endorsement by D, can 
recover the amount thereof from B, C, or D and himself being a prior party is liable to all of them. Therefore, 
A having been relegated by the second endorsement to his original position, cannot sue B, C and D.  
Where an endorser so excludes his liability and afterwards becomes the holder of the instrument, all the 
intermediate endorsers are liable to him. “the italicised portion of the above Section is important”.  An 
illustration will make the point clear. A is the payee of a negotiable instrument. He endorses the instrument 
‘sans recourse’ to B, B endorses to C, C to D, and D again endorses it to A. In this case, A is not only 
reinstated in his former rights but has the right of an endorsee against B, C and D. 
Negotiation of Lost Instrument or that Obtained by Unlawful Means 
When a negotiable instrument has been lost or has been obtained from any maker, acceptor or holder 
thereof by means of an offence or fraud, or for an unlawful consideration, no possessor or endorsee, who 
claims through the person who found or obtained the instrument is entitled to receive the amount due 
thereon from such maker, acceptor, or holder from any party prior to such holder unless such possessor or 
endorsee is, or some person through whom he claims was, a holder in due course. 
EP-EBCL 
618 
Forged Endorsement 
The case of a forged endorsement is worth special notice. If an instrument is endorsed in full, it cannot be 
negotiated except by an endorsement signed by the person to whom or to whose order the instrument is 
payable, for the endorsee obtains title only through his endorsement. Thus, if an instrument be negotiated by 
means of a  forged endorsement, the endorsee acquires no title even though he be a purchaser for value and 
in good faith, for the endorsement is a nullity. Forgery conveys no title. But where the instrument is a bearer 
instrument or has been endorsed in blank, it can be negotiated by mere delivery, and the holder derives his title 
independent of the forged endorsement and can claim the amount from any of the parties to the instrument.  
For example, a bill is endorsed, “Pay A or order”. A endorses it in blank, and it comes into the hands of B, who 
simply delivers it to C, C forges B’s endorsement and transfer it to D. Here, D, as the holder does not derive his 
title through the forged endorsement of B, but through the genuine endorsement of A and can claim payment 
from any of the parties to the instrument in spite of the intervening forged endorsement. 
Acceptance of a Bill of Exchange 
The drawee of a bill of exchange, as such, has no liability on any bill addressed to him for acceptance or 
payment. A refusal to accept or to pay such bill gives the holder no rights against him. The drawee becomes 
liable only after he accepts the bill. The acceptor has to write the word ‘accepted’ on the bill and sign his 
name below it. Thus, it is the acceptor who is primarily liable on a bill. 
The acceptance of a bill is the indication by the drawee of his assent to the order of the drawer. Thus, when 
the drawee writes across the face of the bill the word “accepted” and signs his name underneath he 
becomes the acceptor of the bill. 
An acceptance may be either general or qualified. A general acceptance is absolute and as a rule, an 
acceptance has to be general.  Where an acceptance is made subject to some condition or qualification, 
thereby varying the effect of the bill, it is a qualified acceptance.   The holder of the bill may either refuse to 
take a qualified acceptance or non-acquiescence in it. Where he refuses to take it, he can treat the bill as 
dishonoured by non-acceptance, and sue the drawer accordingly. 
Acceptance for Honour  
When a bill has been noted or protested for non-acceptance or for better security, any person not being a 
party already liable thereon may, with the consent of the holder, by writing on the bill, accept the same for the 
honour of any party thereto. The stranger so accepting, will declare under his hand that he accepts the 
protested bill for the honour of the drawer or any particular endorser whom he names. 
The acceptor for honour is liable to pay only when the bill has been duly presented at maturity to the drawee for 
payment and the drawee has refused to pay and the bill has been noted and protested for non-payment. Where 
a bill has been protested for non-payment after having been duly accepted, any person may intervene and pay 
it supra protest for the honour of any party liable on the bill. When a bill is paid supra protest,  it ceases to be 
negotiable. The stranger, on paying for honour, acquires all the right of holder for whom he pays. 
Presentment for Acceptance  
It is only bills of exchange that require presentment for acceptance and even these of certain kinds only. Bills 
payable on demand or on a fixed date need not be presented. Thus, a bill payable 60 days after due date on 
the happening of a certain event may or may not be presented for acceptance. But the following bills must be 
presented for acceptance otherwise, the parties to the bill will not be liable on it: 
 
(a) A bill payable after sight. Presentment is necessary in order to fix maturity of the bills; and 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
619 
 
(b) A bill in which there is an express stipulation that it shall be presented for acceptance before it is 
presented for payment. 
Section 15 provides that the presentment for acceptance must be made to the drawee or his duly authorised 
agent. If the drawee is dead, the bill should be presented to his legal representative, or if he has been 
declared an insolvent, to the official receiver or assigner. 
The following are the persons to whom a bill of exchange should be presented: 
 
(i) The drawee or his duly authorised agent. 
 
(ii) If there are many drawees, bill must be presented to all of them. 
 
(iii) The legal representatives of the drawee if drawee is dead. 
 
(iv) The official receiver or assignee of insolvent drawee. 
 
(v) To a drawee in case of need, if there is any. This is necessary when the original drawee refuses to 
accept the bill. 
 
(vi) The acceptor for honour. In case the bill is not accepted and is noted or protested for non-
acceptance, the bill may be accepted by the acceptor for honour. He is a person who comes 
forward to accept the bill when it is dishonoured by non-acceptance. 
The presentment must be made before maturity, within a reasonable time after it is drawn, or within the 
stipulated period, if any, on a business day within business hours and at the place of business  or residence 
of the drawee. The presentment must be made by exhibiting the bill to the drawee; mere notice of its 
existence in the possession of holder will not be sufficient. 
When presentment is compulsory and the holder fails to present for acceptance, the drawer and all the 
endorsers are discharged from liability to him. 
Presentment for Acceptance when Excused 
Compulsory presentment for acceptance is excused and the bill may be treated as dishonoured in the 
following cases: 
 
(a) Where the drawee cannot be found after reasonable search. 
 
(b) Where drawee is a fictitious person or one incapable of contracting. 
 
(c) Where although the presentment is irregular, acceptance has been refused on some other ground. 
Presentment for Payment 
Section 64 lays down the general rule as to presentment of negotiable instruments for payment. It says all 
notes, bills and cheques must be presented for payment thereof respectively by or on behalf of the holder 
during the usual hours of business and of the maker or acceptor, and if at banker’s within banking hours. 
[Section 64(1)] 
As mentioned earlier, the definition of cheque has been broadened to include the electronic image of a 
truncated cheque and a cheque in the electronic form. Thus, the section has also been suitably amended to 
provide rules as to presentment of truncated cheque. The amendment, despite recognising electronic image 
of a truncated cheque, has made provision for the drawee bank to call for the truncated cheque in original if it 
is not satisfied about the instrument. 
Section 64(2) stipulates, where an electronic image of a truncated cheque is presented for payment, the 
EP-EBCL 
620 
drawee bank is entitled to demand any further information regarding the truncated cheque from the bank 
holding the truncated cheque in case of any reasonable suspicion about the genuineness of the apparent 
tenor of instrument, and if the suspicion is that of any fraud, forgery, tampering or destruction of the 
instrument, it is entitled to further demand the presentment of the truncated cheque itself for verification: 
Provided that the truncated cheque so demanded by the drawee bank shall be retained by it, if the payment 
is made accordingly. 
Presentment for Payment when Excused  
No presentment is necessary and the instrument may be treated as dishonoured in the following cases: 
 
(a) Where the maker, drawer or acceptor actively does something so as to intentionally obstruct the 
presentment of the instrument, e.g., deprives the holder of the instrument and keeps it after 
maturity. 
 
(b) Where his business place is closed on the due date. 
 
(c) Where no person is present to make payment at the place specified for payment. 
 
(d) Where he cannot, after due search be found. (Section 61) 
 
(e) Where there is a promise to pay notwithstanding non-presentment. 
 
(f) Where the presentment is express or impliedly waived by the party entitled to presentment. 
 
(g) Where the drawer could not possibly have suffered any damage by non-presentment. 
 
(h) Where the drawer is a fictitious person, or one incompetent to contract. 
 
(i) Where the drawer and the drawee are the same person. 
 
(j) Where the bill is dishonoured by non-acceptance. 
 
(k) Where presentment has become impossible, e.g., the declaration of war between the countries of 
the holder and drawee. 
 
(l) Where though the presentment is irregular, acceptance has been refused on some other grounds. 
Dishonour by Non-Acceptance 
Section 91 provides that a bill is said to be dishonoured by non-acceptance: 
 
(a) When the drawee does not accept it within 48 hours from the time of presentment for acceptance. 
 
(b) When presentment for acceptance is excused and the bill remains unaccepted. 
 
(c) When the drawee is incompetent to contract. 
 
(d) When the drawee is a fictitious person or after reasonable search can not be found. 
 
(e) Where the acceptance is a qualified one. 
Dishonour by Non-payment (Section 92) 
A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is said to be dishonoured by non-payment when the maker of 
the note, acceptor of the bill or drawee of the cheque makes default in payment upon being duly required to 
pay the same. Also, a negotiable instrument is dishonoured by non-payment when presentment for payment 
is excused and the instrument when overdue remains unpaid. 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
621 
If the bill is dishonoured either by non-acceptance or by non-payment, the drawer and all the endorsers of 
the bill are liable to the holder, provided he gives notice of such dishonour. The drawee is liable only when 
there is dishonour by non-payment. 
Notice of Dishonour (Sections 91-98 and Sections 105-107) 
When a negotiable instrument is dishonoured either by non-acceptance or by non-payment, the holder or 
some party liable thereon must give notice of dishonour to all other parties whom he seeks to make liable. 
Each party receiving notice of dishonour must in order to render any prior party liable to himself, give notice 
of dishonour to such party within a reasonable time after he has received it. The object of giving notice is not 
to demand payment but to whom the party notified of his liability and in case of drawer to enable him to 
protect himself as against the drawee or acceptor who has dishonoured the instrument issued by him. Notice 
of dishonour is so necessary that an omission to give it discharges all parties other than the maker or 
acceptor. These parties are discharged not only on the bill or note, but also in respect of the original 
consideration. 
Notice may be oral or in writing, but it must be actual formal notice. It must be given within a reasonable time 
of dishonour. 
Notice of Dishonour Unnecessary  
No notice of dishonour is necessary: 
 
(a) When it is dispensed with or waived by the party entitled thereto, e.g., where an endorser writes on 
the instrument such words as “notice of dishonour waived”, 
 
(b) When the drawer has countermanded payment. 
 
(c) When the party charged would not suffer damage for want of notice. 
 
(d) When the party entitled to notice cannot after due search be found. 
 
(e) When the omission to give notice is caused by unavoidable circumstances, e.g., death or 
dangerous illness of the holder. 
 
(f) Where the acceptor is also a drawer, e.g., where a firm draws on its branch. 
 
(g) Where the promissory note is not negotiable. Such a note cannot be endorsed. 
 
(h) Where the party entitled to notice promises to pay unconditionally. 
Noting and Protest (Sections 99-104 A) 
 
Noting 
Where a note or bill is dishonoured, the holder is entitled after giving due notice of dishonour, to sue the 
drawer and the endorsers. Section 99 provides a convenient method of  authenticating the   fact of dishonour 
by means of “Noting”. Where a bill or note is dishonoured, the holder may, if he so desires, cause such 
dishonour to be noted by a notary public on the instrument, or on a paper attached thereto or partly on each. 
The noting or minute must be recorded by the notary public within a reasonable time after dishonour and 
must contain the fact of dishonour, the date of dishonour, the reason, if any, assigned for such dishonour if 
the instrument has not been expressly dishonoured the reasons why the holder treats it dishonoured and 
notary’s charges. 
EP-EBCL 
622 
Protest 
The protest is the formal notarial certificate attesting the dishonour of the bill, and based upon the noting 
which has been effected on the dishonour of the bill. After the noting has been made, the formal protest is 
drawn up by the notary and when it is drawn up it relates back to the date of noting. 
Where the acceptor of a bill has become insolvent, or has suspended  payment, or his credit has been 
publicly impeached, before the maturity of the bill, the holder may have the bill protested for better security. 
The notary public demands better security and on its refusal makes a protest known as “protest for better 
security”.  
Foreign bills must be protested for dishonour when such protest is required by the law of the place where 
they are drawn. Foreign promissory notes need not be so protested. Where a bill is required by law to be 
protested, then instead of a notice of dishonour, notice of protest must be given by the notary public. 
A protest to be valid must contain on the instrument itself or a literal  transcript thereof, the names of the 
parties for and against whom protest is made, the fact and reasons for dishonour together with the place and 
time of dishonour and the signature of the notary public. Protest affords an authentic evidence of dishonour 
to the drawer and the endorsee. 
Discharge 
The discharge in relation to negotiable instrument may be either (i) discharge of the instrument or (ii) 
discharge of one or more parties to the instrument from liability. 
Discharge of the Instrument 
A negotiable instrument is discharged: 
 
(a) by payment in due course; 
 
(b) when the principal debtor becomes the holder; 
 
(c) by an act that would discharge simple contract; 
 
(d) by renunciation; and  
 
(e) by cancellation. 
Discharge of a Party or Parties 
When any particular party or parties are discharged, the instrument continues to be negotiable and the 
undischarged parties remain liable on it. For example, the non-presentment of a bill on the due date 
discharges the endorsers from their liability, but the acceptor remains liable on it. 
A party may be discharged in the following ways : 
 
(a) By cancellation by the holder of the name of any party to it with the intention of discharging him. 
 
(b) By release, when the holder releases any party to the instrument  
 
(c) Discharge of secondary parties, i.e., endorsers. 
 
(d) By the operation of the law, i.e., by insolvency of the debtor. 
 
(e) By allowing drawee more than 48 hours to accept the bill, all previous parties are discharged. 
 
(f) By non-presentment of cheque promptly the drawer is discharged. 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
623 
 
(g) By taking qualified acceptance, all the previous parties are discharged.  
 
(h) By material alteration.  
Material Alteration (Section 87) 
An alteration is material which in any way alters the operation of the instrument and the liabilities of the 
parties thereto. Therefore, any change in an instrument which causes it to speak a different language in legal 
effect from that which it originally spoke, or which changes legal character of the instrument is a material 
alteration.  
A material alteration renders the instrument void, but it affects only those persons who have already become 
parties at the date of the alteration. Those who take the altered instrument cannot complain. Section 88 
provides that an acceptor or endorser of a negotiable instrument is bound by his acceptance or endorsement 
notwithstanding any previous alteration of the instrument. 
Examples of material alteration are : 
Alteration (i) of the date of the instrument (ii) of the sum payable, (iii) in the time of payment, (iv) of the place 
of payment,(v) of the rate of interest,  (vi) by addition of a new party, (vii) tearing the instrument in a material 
part. 
There is no material alteration and the instrument is not vitiated in the following cases: 
(i) correction of a mistake,  (ii) to carry out the common intention of the parties, (iii) an alteration made before 
the instrument is issued and made with the consent of the parties, (iv) crossing a cheque, (v) addition of the 
words “on demand” in an instrument where no time of payment is stated. 
Section 89 affords protection to a person who pays an altered note bill or cheque. However, in order to be 
able to claim the protection, the following conditions must be fulfilled: 
 
(i) the alteration should not be apparent; 
 
(ii) the payment must be made in due course; and 
 
(iii) the payment must be by a person or banker liable to pay. 
Section 89 has been amended to provide for the amendment in the definition of cheque so as to provide for 
electronic image of a truncated cheque. The section provides that any bank or a clearing house which 
receives a transmitted electronic image of a truncated cheque, shall verify from the party who transmitted the 
image to it, that the image so transmitted to it and received by it, is exactly the same. Where there is any 
difference in apparent tenor of such electronic image and the truncated cheque, it shall be a material 
alteration. In such a case, it shall be the duty of the bank or the clearing house, as the case may be, to 
ensure the exactness of the apparent tenor of electronic image of the truncated cheque while truncating and 
transmitting the image. If the bank fails to discharge this duty, the payment made by it shall not be regarded 
as good and it shall not be afforded protection. 
Retirement of a Bill under Rebate 
An acceptor of a bill may make payment before maturity,  and the bill is then said to be retired, but it is not 
discharged and must not be cancelled except by the acceptor when it comes into his hands. It is customary 
in such a case to make allowance of interest on the money to the acceptor for the remainder of the time 
which the bill has to run. The interest allowance is known as rebate.

Hundis 
Hundis are negotiable instruments written in an oriental language. They are sometimes bills of exchange and 
sometimes promissory notes, and are not covered under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Generally, 
they are governed by the customs and usages in the locality but if custom is silent on the point in dispute 
before the Court, this Act applies to the hundis. The term “hundi” was formerly applicable to native bills of 
exchange. The promissory notes were then called “teep”. The hundis were in circulation in India even before 
the present Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 came into operation. The usages attached to these hundis 
varied with the locality in which they were in circulation. 
Generally understood, the term “hundi” includes all indigenous negotiable instruments whether they are bills 
of exchange or promissory notes. An instrument in order to be a hundi must be capable of being sued by the 
holder in his own name, and must by the custom of trade be transferred like cash by delivery. Obviously the 
customs relating to hundis were many. In certain parts of the country even oral acceptance was in vague. 
The following types of hundis are worth mentioning : 
1.  Shah Jog Hundi 
“Shah” means a respectable and responsible person or a man of worth in the bazar. Shah Jog Hundi means 
a hundi which is payable only to a respectable holder, as opposed to a hundi payable to bearer. In other 
words the drawee before paying the same has to satisfy himself that the payee is a ‘SHAH’. 
2.  Jokhmi Hundi 
A “jokhmi” hundi is always drawn on or against goods shipped on the vessel mentioned in the hundi. It 
implies a condition that money will be paid only in the event of arrival of the goods against which the hundi is 
drawn. It is in the nature of policy of insurance. The difference, however, is that the money is paid before 
hand and is to be recovered if the ship arrives safely. 
3.  Jawabee Hundi 
According to Macpherson, “A person desirous of making a remittance writes to the payee and delivers the 
letter to a banker, who either endorses it on to any of his correspondents near the payee’s place of 
residence, or negotiates its transfer. On the arrival, the letter is forwarded to the payee, who attends and 
gives his receipt in the form of an answer to the letter which is forwarded by the same channel of the drawer 
or the order.” Therefore, this is a form of hundi which is used for remitting money from one place to another. 
4.   Nam jog Hundi 
It is a hundi payable to the party named in the bill or his order. The name of the payee is specifically inserted 
in the hundi. It can also be negotiated like a bill of exchange. Its alteration into a Shah Jog hundi is a material 
alteration and renders it void. 
5.  Darshani Hundi 
This is a hundi payable at sight. It is freely negotiable and the price is regulated by demand and supply. They 
are payable on demand and must be presented for payment within a reasonable time after they are received 
by the holder. 
6.  Miadi Hundi 
This is otherwise called muddati hundi, that is, a hundi payable after a specified period of time. Usually 
money is advanced against these hundis by shroffs after deducting the advance for the period in advance. 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
625 
There are other forms of hundis also like. 
Dhani Jog Hundi - A hundi which is payable to “dhani” i.e., the owner. 
Firman Jog Hundi - which is payable to order if can be negotiated by endorsement and delivery. 
Presumptions of Law 
A negotiable instrument is subject to certain presumptions. These have been recognised by the Negotiable 
Instruments Act under Sections 118 and 119 with a view to facilitate the business transactions. These are 
described below: 
It shall be presumed that: 
 
(1) Every negotiable instrument was made or drawn for consideration irrespective of the consideration 
mentioned in the instrument or not. 
 
(2) Every negotiable instrument having a date was made on such date. 
 
(3) Every accepted bill of exchange was accepted within a reasonable time before its maturity. 
 
(4) Every negotiable instrument was transferred before its maturity. 
 
(5) The instruments were endorsed in the order in which they appear on it. 
 
(6) A lost  or destroyed instrument was duly signed and stamped. 
 
(7) The holder of the instrument is a holder in due course. 
 
(8) In a suit upon an instrument which has been dishonoured, the Court shall presume the fact of 
dishonour, or proof of the protest. 
However these legal presumptions are rebuttable by evidence to the contrary. The burden to prove to the 
contrary lies upon the defendant to the suit and not upon the plaintiff. 
Payment of Interest in case of dishonour 
The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 was amended in the year 1988, revising the rate of interest as 
contained in Sections 80 and 117, from 6 per cent to 18 per cent per annum payable on negotiable 
instruments from the due date in case no rate of interest is specified, or payable to an endorser from the date 
of payment on a negotiable instrument on its dishonour with a view to discourage the withholding of payment 
on negotiable instruments on due dates. 
Penalties in case of dishonour of cheques 
Chapter XVII of the Negotiable Instruments Act provides for penalties in case of dishonour  of  certain  
cheques  for  insufficiencies  of  funds  in  the  accounts. Sections 138 to 147 deal with these aspects. 
Chapter XVII has been amended by the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions) 
Act, 2002. The amendments have provided the drawer with more time to send notice, made the punishment 
for the offence more stringent, given power to court for condonation of delay in filing of complaint, excluded 
liability of government nominated directors, made provision for summary trial of cases under the Chapter and 
time bound disposal of cases, have relaxed the rules of evidence, and made the offences under the Act 
compoundable. 
EP-EBCL 
626 
The working of the provisions of Chapter XVII for a period of more than a decade had brought to the fore 
front various lacunae and shortcomings from which it suffered. It was seen that there were enormous delays 
in the disposal of the cases filed under Section 138 and the drawer of the cheques, by taking shield of 
various technicalities and procedures were frustrating the very object of the Chapter. 
The provisions contained in this Chapter provide that where any cheque drawn by a person for discharge of 
any liability is returned by the bank unpaid for the reason of insufficiency of the amount of money standing to 
the credit of the account on which the cheque was drawn or for the reason that it exceeds the arrangement 
made by the drawer of the cheque with the banker for that account, the drawer of such cheque shall be 
deemed to have committed an offence. In that case, the drawer, without prejudice to the other provisions of 
the Act, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine which 
may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both. 
In order to constitute the said offence  
 
(a) such cheque should have been presented to the bank within a period of six months from the date on 
which it is drawn or within the period of its validity, whichever is earlier; and  
 
(b) the payee or holder in due course of such cheque should have made a demand for the payment of 
the said amount of money by giving notice, in writing, to the drawer of the cheque within thirty days 
of the receipt of information by him from the bank regarding the return of the cheque unpaid; and  
 
(c) the drawer of such cheque should have failed to make the payment of the said amount of money to 
the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque within fifteen days of the receipt of the said 
notice. 
It has also been provided that it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that the holder of such 
cheque received the cheque in the discharge of a liability. Defences which may or may not be allowed in any 
prosecution for such offence have also been provided to make the provisions effective. The Supreme Court 
in Modi Cements Ltd. v. K.K. Nandi, (1988) 28 CLA 491, held that merely because the drawer issued a 
notice to the drawee or to the Bank for ‘stop payment’, it would not preclude an action under Section 138 by 
the drawee or holder in due course. 
The liability of government nominated directors  has been  excluded under Section 141 of the Act dealing 
with ‘offences by companies’. The second proviso inserted in Section 141 by the Amendment Act, 2002 
provides that where a person is nominated as a director of a company by virtue of his holding any office or 
employment in the Central Government or State Government or a financial corporation owned or controlled 
by the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be, he shall not be liable for 
prosecution under this Chapter. In order to ensure that genuine and honest bank customers are not 
harassed or put to inconvenience, sufficient safeguards have also been provided in the new Chapter, as 
under: 
 
(a) that no court shall take cognizance of such offence except on a complaint in writing, made by the 
payee or the holder in due course of the cheque; 
 
(b) that such complaint is made within one month or the date on which the cause of action arises; 
 
 Provided that the cognizance of a complaint may be taken by the court after the prescribed period, if 
the complainant satisfies the court that he had sufficient cause for not making the complaint within 
such period. 
 
(c) that no court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial magistrate of the first class 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
627 
shall try any such offence. (Section 142) 
Moreover, the new Sections inserted by the Amendment Act, 2002 provide that all offences under this 
Chapter shall be tried by a Judicial Magistrate of the first class or by a Metropolitan Magistrate and the 
provisions of Sections 262 to 265 (both inclusive) of the said Code shall, as far as may be, apply to such 
trials: 
Provided that in the case of any conviction in a summary trial under this Section, it shall be lawful for the 
Magistrate to pass a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year and an amount of fine 
exceeding five thousand rupees: 
Provided further that when at the commencement of, or in the course of, a summary trial under this Section, 
it appears to the Magistrate that the nature of the case is such that a sentence of imprisonment for a term 
exceeding one year may have to be passed or that it is, for any other reason, undesirable to try the case 
summarily, the Magistrate shall, after hearing the parties, record an order to that effect and thereafter recall 
any witness who may have been examined and proceed to hear or rehear the case in the manner provided 
by the said Code. 
According to the sub-section (2) of Section 142 of the Negotiable Instrument (Amendment) Act, 2015, the 
offence under section 138 shall be inquired into and tried only by a court within whose local jurisdiction,— 
if the cheque is delivered for collection through an account, the branch of the bank where the payee or holder 
in due course, as the case may be, maintains the account, is situated; or 
if the cheque is presented for payment by the payee or holder in due course, otherwise through an account, 
the branch of the drawee bank where the drawer maintains the account, is situated. 
Explanation. – For the purposes of clause (a), where a cheque is delivered for collection at any branch of the 
bank of the payee or holder in due course, then, the cheque shall be deemed to have been delivered to the 
branch of the bank in which the payee or holder in due course, as the case may be, maintains the account.”. 
(2) The trial of a case under this Section shall, so far as practicable, consistently with the interests of justice, 
be continued from day to day until its conclusion, unless the court finds the adjournment of the trial beyond 
the following day to be necessary for reasons to be recorded in writing. 
(3) Every trial under this Section shall be conducted as expeditiously as possible and an endeavour shall be 
made to conclude the trial within six months from the date of filing of the complaint. (Section 143) 
A Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at 
the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business or personally works for 
gain, by speed post or by such courier services as are approved by a Court of Session. 
Where an acknowledgement purporting to be signed by the accused or the witness or an endorsement 
purported to be made by any person authorised by the postal department or the courier services that the 
accused or the witness refused to take delivery of summons has been received, the court issuing the 
summons may declare that the summons has been duly served. (Section 144) 
The evidence of the complainant may be given by him on affidavit and may, subject to all just exceptions be 
read in evidence in any enquiry, trial or other proceeding under the said Code. 
The court may, if it thinks fit, and shall, on the application of the prosecution or the accused, summon and 
EP-EBCL 
628 
examine any person giving evidence on affidavit as to the facts contained therein. (Section 145) 
The court shall, in respect of every proceeding under this Chapter, on production of bank’s slip or memo 
having thereon the official mark denoting that the cheque has been dishonoured, presume the fact of 
dishonour of such cheque, unless and until such fact is disproved. Every offence punishable under this Act 
shall be compoundable. (Sections 146 and 147) 
The practical effect of these amendments which have only recently been brought into force would be seen 
with time to come but it is expected that they would go a long way in making the remedy provided for by 
Chapter XVII meaningful and effective. 
National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) and Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) 
National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) is a nation-wide payment system facilitating one-to-one funds 
transfer. Under this Scheme, individuals, firms and corporates can electronically transfer funds from any 
bank branch to any individual, firm or corporate having an account with any other bank branch in the country 
participating in the Scheme. 
NEFT is an electronic fund transfer system that operates on a Deferred Net Settlement (DNS) basis which 
settles transactions in batches. In DNS, the settlement takes place with all transactions received till the 
particular cut-off time. These transactions are netted (payable and receivables) in NEFT whereas in RTGS 
the transactions are settled individually. For example, currently, NEFT operates in hourly batches. Any 
transaction initiated after a designated settlement time would have to wait till the next designated settlement 
time Contrary to this, in the RTGS transactions are processed continuously throughout the RTGS business 
hours. 
The acronym ‘RTGS’ stands for Real Time Gross Settlement, which can be defined as the continuous (real- 
time) settlement of funds transfers individually on an order by order basis (without netting). ‘Real Time’ 
means the processing of instructions at the time they are received rather than at some later time; ‘Gross 
Settlement’ means the settlement of funds transfer instructions occurs individually (on an instruction by 
instruction basis). Considering that the funds settlement takes place in the books of the Reserve Bank of 
India, the payments are final and irrevocable. 
LESSON ROUND-UP 
• The law relating to negotiable instruments is contained in the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. It is an Act 
to define and amend the law relating to promissory notes, bills of exchange and Cheques. 
• The term “negotiable instrument” means a document transferable from one person to another. 
• A “promissory note” is an instrument in writing containing an unconditional undertaking, signed by the 
maker to pay a certain sum of money to, or to the order of, a certain person, or only to bearer of the 
instrument. 
• A “bill of exchange” is an instrument in writing containing an unconditional order, signed by the maker, 
directing a certain person to pay a certain sum of money only to or to the order of, a certain person or to the 
bearer of the instrument. 
• Bills of exchange were originally used for payment of debts by traders residing in one country to another 
country with a view to avoid transmission of coin. Now-a-days they are used more as trade bills both in 
connection with domestic trade and foreign trade and are called inland bills and foreign bills respectively. 
• A ‘Cheque’ is a bill of exchange drawn on a specified banker and not expressed to be payable otherwise 
than  on demand  and it  includes the  electronic image  of a  truncated Cheque  and a  Cheque  in  the 
electronic form. 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881
