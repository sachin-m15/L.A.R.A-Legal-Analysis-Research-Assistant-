EXECUTIVE PROGRAMME 
GENERAL AND COMMERCIAL LAWS 
This study material has been published to aid the students in preparing 
for the General and Commercial Laws paper of the CS Executive 
Programme. It has been prepared to provide basic understanding of some of 
the General and Commercial Laws thereunder, which have a bearing on the 
conduct of corporate affairs. It is part of the educational kit and takes the 
students step by step through each phase of preparation stressing key 
concepts, pointers and procedures. Company Secretaryship being a 
professional course, the examination standards are set very high, with 
emphasis on knowledge of concepts, applications, procedures and case 
laws, for which sole reliance on the contents of this study material may not be 
enough. Besides, as per the Company Secretaries Regulations, 1982, 
students are expected to be conversant with the amendments to the laws 
made upto six months preceding the date of examination. The material may, 
therefore, be regarded as the basic material and must be read alongwith the 
original Bare Acts, Rules, Regulations, Case Law, Student Company 
Secretary Bulletin published and supplied to the students by the Institute 
every month as well as recommended readings given with each study lesson. 
This study material has been updated upto August, 2011.  The subject of 
General and Commercial Laws is inherently complicated and is subjected to 
constant refinement through new primary legislations, rules and regulations 
made thereunder and court decisions on specific legal issues. It, therefore 
becomes necessary for every student to constantly update himself with the 
various legislative changes made as well as judicial pronouncements 
rendered from time to time by referring to the Institute’s journal ‘Chartered 
Secretary’ and bulletin ‘Student Company Secretary’ as well as other 
law/professional journals. 
In the event of any doubt, students may write to the Directorate of 
Academics and Professional Development of the Institute for clarification. 
The Right to Information Act, 2005 considered as watershed legislation, 
is the most significant milestone in the history of Right to Information 
movement in India allowing transparency and autonomy and access to 
accountability. A new chapter titled Law Relating to Information Technology 
has been included in this study material to enable the students to understand 
the significance of right to information in the changing scenario, and be well 
versed with the important provisions of the Right to Information Act. 
Although care has been taken in publishing this study material yet the 
possibility of errors, omissions and/or discrepancies cannot be ruled out. This 
 
(iv) 
publication is released with an understanding that the Institute shall not be 
responsible for any errors, omissions and/or discrepancies or any action 
taken in that behalf. 
Should there be any discrepancy, error or omission noted in the study 
material, the Institute shall be obliged if the same is brought to its notice for 
issue of corrigendum in the Student Company Secretary. 
The study material contains 10 study lessons. At the end of study 
material, Test Papers are appended. Students may note that Test Papers 1 
and 2 are Optional, whereas Test Papers 3, 4 and 5 are Compulsory. 
Students are advised to submit answers to the Test Papers strictly under 
examination conditions after making through preparation.

I.  BROAD FRAMEWORK OF THE CONSTITUTION 
The Constitution of India came into force on January 26, 1950. It is a 
comprehensive document containing 395 Articles (divided into 22 Parts) and 12 
Schedules. Apart from dealing with the structure of Government, the Constitution 
makes detailed provisions for the rights of citizens and other persons in a number of 
entrenched provisions and for the principles to be followed by the State in the 
governance of the country, labelled as ―Directive Principles of State Policy‖.  All public 
authorities – legislative, administrative and judicial derive their powers directly or 
indirectly from it and the Constitution derives its authority from the people.

1.  Preamble 
The preamble to the Constitution sets out the aims and aspirations of the people 
of India. It is a part of the Constitution (AIR 1973 SC 1961). The preamble declares 
India to be a Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic Republic and secures to all its 
citizens Justice, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity. It is declared that the Constitution 
has been given by the people to themselves, thereby affirming the republican 
character of the polity and the sovereignty of the people. 
The polity assured to the people of India by the Constitution is described in the 
preamble as a Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, and Democratic Republic. The 
expression ―Sovereign‖ signifies that the Republic is externally and internally 
sovereign. Sovereignty in the strict and narrowest sense of the term implies 
independence all round, within and without the borders of the country.  As discussed 
above, legal sovereignty is vested in the people of India and political sovereignty is 
distributed between the Union and the States. 
The democratic character of the Indian polity is illustrated by the provisions 
conferring on the adult citizens the right to vote and by the provisions for elected 
representatives and responsibility of the executive to the legislature. 
The word ―Socialist‖, added by the 42nd Amendment, aims to secure to its 
people ―justice—social, economic and political‖. The Directive Principles of State 
Policy,  contained  in  Part IV  of  the  Constitution  are  designed  for  the 
achievement of the socialistic goal envisaged in the preamble. The expression 
―Democratic Republic‖ signifies that our government is of the people, by the people 
and for the people. 
2.  Structure 
Constitution of India is basically federal but with certain unitary features. 
The majority of the Supreme Court judges in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of 
Kerala, AIR 1973 SC 1461, were of the view that the federal features form the basic 
structure of the Indian Constitution. However, there is some controversy as to 
whether the Indian Constitution establishes a federal system or it stipulates a unitary 
form of Government with some basic federal features. Thus, to decide whether our 
Constitution is federal, unitary or quasi federal, it would be better to have a look at the 
contents of the Constitution. 
The essential features of a Federal Polity or System are—dual Government, 
distribution of powers, supremacy of the Constitution, independence of Judiciary, 
written Constitution, and a rigid procedure for the amendment of the Constitution. The 
political system introduced by our Constitution possesses all the aforesaid essentials 
of a federal polity as follows: 
 (a) In India, there are Governments at different levels, like Union and States. 
 (b) Powers to make laws have been suitably distributed among them by way of 
various lists as per the Seventh Schedule. 
 (c) Both Union and States have to follow the Constitutional provisions when they 
make laws. 
 
EP-GCL-1 
3
 (d) The Judiciary is independent with regard to judicial matters and judiciary can 
test the validity of law independently. The Supreme Court decides the 
disputes between the Union and the States, or the States inter se. 
 (e) The Constitution is supreme and if it is to be amended, it is possible only by 
following the procedure explained in Article 368 of the Constitution itself. 
From the above, it is clear that the Indian Constitution basically has federal 
features. But the Indian Constitution does not establish two co-ordinate independent 
Governments. Both the Governments co-ordinate, co-operate and collaborate in each 
other‘s efforts to achieve the ideals laid down in the preamble.  
Judicial View 
The question as to whether the Indian Constitution has a federal form of 
Government or a unitary constitution with some federal features came up in various 
cases before the Supreme Court and the High Courts. But in most cases, the 
observations have been made in a particular context and have to be understood 
accordingly. The question rests mostly on value judgement i.e. on one‘s own 
philosophy. 
Peculiar Features of Indian Federalism 
Indian Constitution differs from the federal systems of the world in certain 
fundamental aspects, which are as follows: 
(1) The Mode of Formation: A federal Union, as in the American system, is 
formed by an agreement between a number of sovereign and independent States, 
surrendering a defined part of their sovereignty or autonomy to a new central 
organisation. But there is an alternative mode of federation, as in the Canadian 
system where the provinces of a Unitary State may be transformed into a federal 
union to make themselves autonomous. 
India had a thoroughly Centralised Unitary Constitution until the Government of 
India Act, 1935 which for the first time set up a federal system in the manner as in 
Canada viz., by creation of autonomous units and combining them into a federation 
by one and the same Act. 
(2) Position of the States in the Federation: In a federal system, a number of 
safeguards are provided for the protection of State‘s rights as they are independent 
before the formation of federation. In India, as the States were not previously 
sovereign entities, the rights were exercised mainly by Union, e.g., residuary powers. 
(3) Citizenship etc: The framers of the American Constitution made a logical 
division of everything essential to sovereignty and created a dual polity with dual 
citizenship, a double set of officials and a double system of the courts. There is, 
however, single citizenship in India, with no division of public services or of the 
judiciary. 
(4) Residuary Power: Residuary power is vested in the Union.  In other words, 
the Constitution of India is neither purely federal nor purely unitary. It is a combination 
of both and is based upon the principle that ―In spite of federalism the national 
interest ought to be paramount as against autocracy stepped with the establishment 
of supremacy of law‖.

II.  FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS 
The Constitution seeks to secure to the people ―liberty of thought, expression, 
belief, faith and worship; equality of status and of opportunity; and fraternity assuring 
the dignity of the individual‖. With this object, the fundamental rights are envisaged in 
Part III of the Constitution. 
1.  The Concept of Fundamental Rights 
Political philosophers in the 17th Century began to think that the man by birth had 
certain rights which were universal and inalienable, and he could not be deprived of 
them. The names of Rousseau, Locke, Montaesgue and Blackstone may be noted in 
this context. The Declaration of American Independence 1776, stated that all men are 
created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights: 
that among these, are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Since the 17th 
century, it had been considered that man has certain essential, basic, natural and 
inalienable rights and it is the function of the State to recognise these rights and allow 
them a free play so that human liberty may be preserved, human personality 
developed and an effective cultural, social and democratic life promoted. It was 
thought that these rights should be entrenched in such a way that they may not be 
interfered with, by an oppressive or transient majority in the Legislature. With this in 
view, some written Constitutions (especially after the First World War) guarantee 
rights of the people and forbid every organ of the Government from interfering with 
the same. 
The position in England: The Constitution of England is unwritten. No Code of 
Fundamental Rights exists unlike in the Constitution of the United States or India. In 
the doctrine of the sovereignty of Parliament as prevailing in England it does not 
envisage a legal check on the power of the Parliament which is, as a matter of legal 
theory, free to make any law. This does not mean, however, that in England there is 
no recognition of these basic rights of the individual. The object in fact is secured 
here in a different way. The protection of individual freedom in England rests not on 
constitutional guarantees but on public opinion, good sense of the people, strong 
common law, traditions favouring individual liberty, and the parliamentary form of 
Government. Moreover, the participation of U.K. in the European Union has made a 
difference. (See also the Human Rights Act, 1998). 
The position in America: The nature of the Fundamental Rights in the U.S.A. has 
been described thus: The very purpose of the Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain 
 
EP-GCL-1 
5
subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach 
of majorities and officials, to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the 
Courts. 
The fundamental difference in approach to the question of individual rights 
between England and the United States is that while the English were anxious to 
protect individual rights from the abuses of executive power, the framers of the 
American Constitution were apprehensive of tyranny, not only from the executive but 
also from the legislature. While the English people, in their fight for freedom against 
autocracy stopped with the establishment of Parliamentary supremacy, the 
Americans went further to assert that there had to be a law superior to the legislature 
itself and that the restraint of such paramount written law could only save them from 
the fears of absolution and autocracy which are ingrained in the human nature. 
So, the American Bill of Rights (contained in first ten Amendments of the 
Constitution of the U.S.A.) is equally binding upon the legislature, as upon the 
executive. The result has been the establishment in the United States of a ‗Judicial 
Supremacy‘, as opposed to the ‗Parliamentary Supremacy‘ in England. The Courts in 
the United States are competent to declare an Act of Congress as unconstitutional on 
the ground of contravention of any provision of the Bill of Rights. 
The position in India: As regards India, the Simon Commission and the Joint 
Parliamentary Committee had rejected the idea of enacting declaration of 
Fundamental Rights on the ground that abstract declarations are useless, unless 
there exists the will and the means to make them effective. The Nehru Committee 
recommended the inclusion of Fundamental Rights in the Constitution for the country. 
Although that demand of the people was not met by the British Parliament under the 
Government of India Act, 1935, yet the enthusiasm of the people to have such rights 
in the Constitution was not impaired. As a result of that enthusiasm they were 
successful in getting a recommendation being included in the Statement of May 16, 
1946 made by the Cabinet Mission-(which became the basis of the present 
Constitution) to the effect that the Constitution-making body may adopt the rights in 
the Constitution. Therefore, as soon as Constituent Assembly began to work in 
December, 1947, in its objectives resolution Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru moved for the 
protection of certain rights to be provided in the Constitution. The rights as they 
emerged are contained in Part III of the Constitution the title of which is ―Fundamental 
Rights‖. The Supreme Court in Pratap Singh v. State of Jharkhand, (2005) 3 SCC 
551 held that Part III of the Constitution protects substantive as well as procedural 
rights and hence implications which arise there from must efficiently be protected by 
the Judiciary. 
2.  Inclusion of Fundamental Rights in Part III of the Constitution 
Part III of the Indian Constitution guarantees six categories of 
fundamental rights. These are: 
 
(i) Right to Equality—Articles 14 to 18; 
 
(ii) Right to Freedom—Articles 19 to 22; 
 (iii) Right against Exploitation—Articles 23 and 24; 
 (iv) Right to Freedom of Religion—Articles 25 to 28; 
EP-GCL-1 
6
 (v) Cultural and Educational Rights—Articles 29 and 30; 
 (vi) Right to Constitutional Remedies—Articles 32. 
[Earlier the right to property under Article 31 was also guaranteed as a 
Fundamental Right which has been removed by the 44th Constitutional Amendment 
Act, 1978. Now right to property is not a fundamental right, it is now only a legal right. 
Apart from this, Articles 12 and 13 deal with definition of ‗State‘ and ‗Law‘ 
respectively. Articles 33 to 35 deal with the general provisions relating to 
Fundamental Rights. No fundamental right in India is absolute and reasonable 
restrictions can be imposed in the interest of the state by valid legislation and in such 
case the Court normally would respect the legislative policy behind the same. 
People’s Union for Civil Liberties  v. Union of India, (2004) 2 SCC 476. 
From the point of view of persons to whom the rights are available, the 
fundamental rights may be classified as follows: 
 (a) Articles 15, 16, 19 and 30 are guaranteed only to citizens. 
 (b) Articles 14, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 27 and 28 are available to any person on the 
soil of India—citizen or foreigner. 
 (c) The rights guaranteed by Articles 15, 17, 18, 20, 24 are absolute limitations 
upon the legislative power. 
For convenience as well as for their better understanding it is proper to take each 
of these separately. But some related terms are necessary to be understood first. 
3.  Definition of State 
With a few exceptions, all the fundamental rights are available against the State. 
Under Article 12, unless the context otherwise requires, ―the State‖ includes— 
 (a) the Government and Parliament of India; 
 (b) the Government and the Legislature of each of the States; and 
 (c) all local or other authorities: 
 
(i) within the territory of India; or 
 
(ii) under the control of the Government of India. 
The expression ‗local authorities‘ refers to authorities like Municipalities, District 
Boards, Panchayats, Improvement Trusts, Port Trusts and Mining Settlement Boards. 
The Supreme Court has held that ‗other authorities‘ will include all authorities created 
by the Constitution or statute on whom powers are conferred by law and it is not 
necessary that the authority should engage in performing government functions 
(Electricity Board, Rajasthan v. Mohanlal, AIR 1967 SC 1957).  The Calcutta High 
Court has held that the electricity authorities being State within the meaning of Article 
12, their action can be judicially reviewed by this Court under Article 226 of the 
Constitution of India. (In re: Angur Bala Parui, AIR 1999 Cal. 102). It has also been 
held that a university is an authority (University of Madras v. Shanta Bai, AIR 1954 
Mad. 67). The Gujarat High Court has held that the President is ―State‖ when making 
an order under Article 359 of the Constitution (Haroobhai v. State of Gujarat, AIR 
1967, Guj. 229). The words ―under the control of the Government of India‖ bring, into 
the definition of State, not only every authority within the territory of India, but also 
 
EP-GCL-1 
7
those functioning outside, provided such authorities are under the control of the 
Government of India. In Bidi Supply Co. v. Union of India, AIR 1956 SC 479, State 
was interpreted to include its Income-tax department. 
The Supreme Court in Sukhdev Singh v. Bhagatram, AIR 1975 SC 1331 and in 
R.D. Shetty v. International Airports Authority, AIR 1979 SC 1628, has pointed out 
that corporations acting as instrumentality or agency of government would become 
‗State‘ because obviously they are subjected to the same limitations in the field of 
constitutional or administrative law as the government itself, though in the eye of law 
they would be distinct and independent legal entities. In Satish Nayak v. Cochin 
Stock Exchange Ltd. (1995 Comp LJ 35), the Kerala High Court held that since a 
Stock Exchange was independent of Government control and was not discharging 
any public duty, it cannot be treated as ‗other authority‘ under Article 12. 
Test for instrumentality or agency of the State 
In Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib, AIR 1981 SC 481, the Supreme Court has 
enunciated the following test for determining whether an entity is an 
instrumentality or agency of the State: 
 
(1) If the entire share capital of the Corporation is held 
by the Government, it would go a long way towards 
indicating that the corporation is an instrumentality or 
agency of the Government. 
 
(2) Where the financial assistance of the State is so 
much as to meet almost the entire expenditure of the 
corporation it would afford some indication of the corporation being 
impregnated with government character. 
 (3) Whether the corporation enjoys a monopoly status which is conferred 
or protected by the State. 
 (4) Existence of deep and pervasive State control may afford an indication 
that the corporation is a State agency or an instrumentality. 
 (5) If the functions of the corporation are of public importance and closely 
related to government functions, it would be a relevant factor in 
classifying a corporation as an instrumentality or agency of 
government. 
 (6) If a department of government is transferred to a corporation, it would 
be a strong factor supporting an inference of the corporation being an 
instrumentality or agency of government. 
An important decision on the definition of State in Article 12 is Pradeep Kumar 
Biswas  v. Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, (2002) 5 SCC 111. A seven 
Judge Bench of the Supreme Court by a majority of 5:2 held that CSIR is an 
instrumentality of “the State” falling within the scope of Article 12. The multiple 
test which is to be applied to ascertain the character of a body as falling within 
Article 12 or outside is to ascertain the nature of financial, functional and 
administrative control of the State over it and whether it is dominated by the 
State Government and the control can be said to be so deep and pervasive so 
as to satisfy the court “of brooding presence of the Government” on the 
activities of the body concerned.  
EP-GCL-1

In Zee Telefilms Ltd.  v. Union of India, (2005) 4 SCC 649, the Supreme 
Court applying the tests laid down in Pardeep Kumar Biswas case held that the 
Board of Control for cricket in India (BCCI) was not State for purposes of 
Article 12 because it was not shown to be financially, functionally or 
administratively dominated by or under the control of the Government and 
control exercised by the Government was not pervasive but merely regulatory 
in nature. 
Judiciary although an organ of State like the executive and the legislature, is not 
specifically mentioned in Article 12. However, the position is that where the Court 
performs judicial functions, e.g. determination of scope of fundamental rights vis-a-vis 
legislature or executive action, it will not occasion the infringement of fundamental 
rights and therefore it will not come under ‗State‘ in such situation (A.R. Antualay v. 
R.S. Nayak, (1988) 2 SCC 602). While in exercise of non-judicial functions e.g. in 
exercise of rule-making powers, where a Court makes rules which contravene the 
fundamental rights of citizens, the same could be challenged treating the Court as 
‗State‘. 
4.  Justifiability of Fundamental Rights 
Article 13 gives teeth to the fundamental rights. It lays down the 
rules of interpretation in regard to laws inconsistent with or in derogation 
of the Fundamental Rights. 
Exsiting Laws: Article 13(1) relates to the laws already existing in 
force, i.e. laws which were in force before the commencement of the 
Constitution (pre constitutional laws). A declaration by the Court of their invalidity, 
however, will be necessary before they can be disregarded and declares that pre-
constitution laws are void to the extent to which they are inconsistent with the 
fundamental rights. 
Future Laws: Article 13(2) relates to future laws, i.e., laws made after the 
commencement of the Constitution (post constitutional laws). After the Constitution 
comes into force the State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the 
rights conferred by Part III and if such a law is made, it shall be void to the extent to 
which it curtails any such right. 
The word ‗law‘ according to the definition given in Article 13 itself includes— 
―... any Ordinance, order, bye-law, rule, regulation, notification, custom or usage 
having in the territory of India, the force of law.‖ 
It is clear that like definition of State in Article 12, the definition of ‗law‘ in Article 
13 is not exhaustive, e.g. it does not speak of even laws made by Parliament or State 
Legislatures which form the largest part of the body of laws. Because of this nature of 
the definition, the issue came up before the Supreme Court as to whether a 
Constitutional Amendment by which a fundamental right included in Part III is taken 
away or abridged is also a law within the meaning of Article 13. The Court twice 
rejected the view that it includes a Constitutional Amendment, but third time in the 
famous Golaknath case (A.I.R. 1967 S.C. 1643) by a majority of 6 to 5, the Court took 
the view that it includes such an amendment and, therefore, even a Constitutional 
amendment would be void to the extent it takes away or abridges any of the 
 
EP-GCL-1 
9
fundamental rights. By the Constitution (Twenty-Fourth Amendment) Act, 1971 a new 
clause has been added to Article 13 which provides that— 
―Nothing in this Article shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution made 
under Article 368‖ 
Article 13 came up for judicial review in a number of cases and the Courts have 
evolved doctrines like doctrine of eclipse, severability, prospective overruling, 
acquiescence etc. for interpreting the provisions of Article 13. 
Doctrine of Severability 
One thing to be noted in Article 13 is that, it is not the entire law which is affected 
by the provisions in Part III, but on the other hand, the law becomes invalid only to 
the extent to which it is inconsistent with the Fundamental Rights. So only that part of 
the law will be declared invalid which is inconsistent, and the rest of the law will 
stand. However, on this point a clarification has been made by the Courts that invalid 
part of the law shall be severed and declared invalid if really it is severable, i.e., if 
after separating the invalid part the valid part is capable of giving effect to the 
legislature‘s intent, then only it will survive, otherwise the Court shall declare the 
entire law as invalid. This is known as the rule of severability. 
The doctrine has been applied invariably to cases where it has been found 
possible to separate the invalid part from the valid part of an Act. Article 13 only says 
that any law which is inconsistent with the fundamental rights is void ―to the extent of 
inconsistency‖ and this has been interpreted to imply that it is not necessary to strike 
down the whole Act as invalid, if only a part is invalid and that part can survive 
independently. In A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras, A.I.R.1950 S.C. 27, the Supreme 
Court ruled that where an Act was partly invalid, if the valid portion was severable 
from the rest, the valid portion would be maintained, provided that it was sufficient to 
carry out the purpose of the Act. 
From above, it is clear that this doctrine applies only to pre constitutional laws as 
according to Article 13(2), State cannot even make any law which is contrary to the 
provisions of this Part. 
Doctrine of Eclipse 
The another noteworthy thing in Article 13 is that, though an existing law 
inconsistent with a fundamental right becomes in-operative from the date of the 
commencement of the Constitution, yet it is not dead altogether. A law made before 
the commencement of the Constitution remains eclipsed or dormant to the extent it 
comes under the shadow of the fundamental rights, i.e. is inconsistent with it, but the 
eclipsed or dormant parts become active and effective again if the prohibition brought 
about by the fundamental rights is removed by the amendment of the Constitution. 
This is known as the doctrine of eclipse. 
The doctrine was first evolved in Bhikaji Narain Dhakras v. 
State of M.P., A.I.R. 1955 S.C. 781. In this case, the validity 
of C.P. and Berar Motor Vehicles Amendment Act, 1947, 
empowering the Government to regulate, control and to 
take up the entire motor transport business, was 
challenged. The Act was perfectly a valid piece of 
legislation at the time of its enactment. But on the 
EP-GCL-1 
10
commencement of the Constitution, the existing law became inconsistent 
under Article 13(1), as it contravened the freedom to carry on trade and 
business under Article 19(1)(g). To remove the infirmity the Constitution (First 
Amendment) Act, 1951 was passed which permitted creation by law of State 
monopoly in respect of motor transport business. The Court held that the 
Article by reason of its language could not be read as having obliterated the 
entire operation of the inconsistent law or having wiped it altogether from the 
statute book. In case of a pre-Constitution law or statute, it was held, that the 
doctrine of eclipse would apply. The relevant part of the judgement is: 
―The true position is that the impugned law became as it were, eclipsed, for the 
time being, by the fundamental right. The effect of the Constitution (First 
Amendment) Act, 1951 was to remove the shadow and to make the impugned 
Act free from all blemish or infirmity.‖ 
However, there was a dispute regarding the applicability of the doctrine of 
eclipse, whether it should be applicable to both pre-Constitution and post-Constitution 
laws or only to pre-constitution laws. Some decisions were in favour of both laws and 
some were in favour of pre-constitution laws only. There is no unambiguous judicial 
pronouncement to that effect. 
Waiver 
The doctrine of waiver of rights is based on the premise that a person is his best 
judge and that he has the liberty to waive the enjoyment of such rights as are 
conferred on him by the State. However, the person must have the knowledge of his 
rights and that the waiver should be voluntary. The doctine was discussed in 
Basheshar Nath  v. C.I.T., AIR 1959 SC 149,  where  the  majority  expressed  its 
view against the waiver of fundamental rights. It was held that it was not open to 
citizens to waive any of the fundamental rights. Any person aggrieved by the 
consequence of the exercise of any discriminatory power, could be heard to complain 
against it. 
The Article has been invoked in many cases. Some of the important cases and 
observations are as under: 
Single Person Law 
A law may be constitutional, even though it relates to a single individual, if 
that single individual is treated as a class by himself on some peculiar 
circumstances. The case is Charanjit Lal Chowdhary v. Union of India, AIR 1951 
SC 41, in this case, the petitioner was an ordinary shareholder of the Sholapur 
Spinning and Weaving Co. Ltd. The company through its directors had been 
managing and running a textile mill of the same name. Later, on account of 
mis-management, a situation had arisen that brought about the closing down 
of the mill, thus affecting the production of an essential commodity, apart from 
causing serious unemployment amongst certain section of the community. The 
Central Government issued an Ordinance which was later replaced by an Act, 
known as Sholapur Spinning & Weaving Co. (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1950. 
With the passing of this Act, the management and the administration of the 
assets of the company were placed under the control of the directors 
appointed by the Government. As regards the shareholders, the Act declared 
 
EP-GCL-1 
11
that they could neither appoint a new director nor could take proceedings 
against the company for winding up. The petitioner filed a writ petition on the 
ground that the said Act infringed the rule of equal protection of laws as 
embodied in Article 14, because a single company and its shareholders were 
subjected to disability as compared with other companies and their 
shareholders. The Supreme Court dismissed the petition and held the 
legislation as valid. It laid down that the law may be constitutional even though 
it applies to a single individual if on account of some special circumstances or 
reasons applicable to him only, that single individual may be treated as a class 
by himself. However, in subsequent cases the Court explained that the rule of 
presumption laid down in Charanjit Lal’s case is not absolute, but would depend on 
facts of each case. 
For a valid classification there has to be a rational nexus between the 
classification made by the law and the object sought to be achieved. For example a 
provision for district-wise distribution of seats in State Medical colleges on the basis 
of population of a district to the population of the State was held to be void (P. 
Rajandran v. State of Mysore, AIR 1968 SC 1012). 
5.  Right of equality 
Articles 14 to 18 of the Constitution deal with equality and its various 
facets. The general principle finds expression in Article 14. Particular 
applications of this right are dealt with in Articles 15 and 16. Still more 
specialised applications of equality are found in Articles 17 and 18. 
Article 14: Equality before the law and equal protection of the laws 
Article 14 of the Constitution says that ―the State shall not deny to any person 
equality before the law or the  equal  protection of the laws within the territory of 
India‖.  
As is evident, Article 14 guarantees to every person the right to equality before the 
law or the equal protection of the laws. The expression ‗equality before the law‘ which is 
barrowed from English Common Law is a declaration of equality of all persons within 
the territory of India, implying thereby the absence of any special privilege in favour of 
any individual. Every person, whatever be his rank or position is subject to the 
jurisdiction of the ordinary courts.  The second expression ―the equal protection of the 
laws‖ which is based on the last clause of the first section of the Fourteenth 
Amendment to the American Constitution directs that equal protection shall be secured 
to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction of the Union in the enjoyment of their 
rights and privileges without favouritism or discrimination. Article 14 applies to all 
persons and is not limited to citizens. A corporation, which is a juristic person, is also 
entitled to the benefit of this Article (Chiranjit Lal Chowdhurary v. Union of India, AIR 
1951 SC 41). The right to equality is also recognised as one of the basic features of the 
Constitution ( Indra Sawhney v. Union of India, AIR 2000 SC 498). 
As a matter of fact all persons are not alike or equal in all respects. Application of 
the same laws uniformly to all of them will, therefore, be inconsistent with the 
principle of equality.  Of course, mathematical equality is not intended. Equals are to 
EP-GCL-1 
12
be governed by the same laws. But as regards unequals, the same laws are not 
complemented. In fact, that would itself lead to inequality. 
Equality is a comparative concept. A person is treated unequally only if that 
person is treated worse than others, and those others (the comparison group) must 
be those who are ‗similarly situated‘ to the complainant. (Glanrock Estate (P) Ltd. v. 
State of T N (2010) 10 SCC 96) 
Legislative classification 
A right conferred on persons that they shall not be denied equal protection of the 
laws does not mean the protection of the same laws for all. It is here that the doctrine 
of classification steps in and gives content and significance to the guarantee of the 
equal protection of the laws. To separate persons similarly situated from those who 
are not, legislative classification or distinction is made carefully between persons who 
are and who are not similarly situated. The Supreme Court in a number of cases has 
upheld the view that Article 14 does not rule out classification for purposes of 
legislation. Article 14 does not forbid classification or differentiation which rests upon 
reasonable grounds of distinction. 
The Supreme Court in State of Bihar v. Bihar State ‘Plus-2’ lectures Associations, 
(2008) 7 SCC 231 held that now it is well settled and cannot be disputed that Article 
14 of the Constitution guarantees equality before the law and confers equal 
protection of laws. It prohibits the state from denying persons or class of persons 
equal treatment; provided they are equals and are similarly situated. It however, does 
not forbid classification. In other words, what Article 14 prohibits is discrimination and 
not classification if otherwise such classification is legal, valid and reasonable. 
Test of valid classification 
Since a distinction is to be made for the purpose of enacting a legislation, it must 
pass the classical test enunciated by the Supreme Court in State of West Bengal v. 
Anwar Ali Sarkar, AIR 1952 SC 75. Permissible classification must satisfy two 
conditions, namely; (i) it must be founded on an intelligible differentia which 
distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the 
group; and (ii) the differentia must have a rational nexus with the object sought to be 
achieved by the statute in question. 
After considering leading cases on equal protection clause enshrined in Article 14 
of the constitution, the five-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Confederation of 
Ex-Servicemen Assns. v. Union of India, (2006) 8 SCC 399 stated: ―In our judgement, 
therefore, it is clear that every classification to be legal, valid and permissible, must 
fulfill the twin test; namely : 
 
(i) the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which must 
distinguish persons or things that are grouped together from others leaving 
out or left out; and 
 (ii) Such a differentia must have rational nexus to the object sought to be 
achieved by the statute or legislation in question‖. 
The classification may be founded on different basis, such as, geographical, or 
according to objects or occupation or the like. What is necessary is that there must be a 
nexus between the basis of classification and the object of the Act under consideration. 
 
EP-GCL-1 
13
A legal and valid classification may be based on educational qualifications (State of 
Bihar v. Bihar State ‘Plus-2’ lecturers Associations and Others, (2008) 7 SCC 238) 
A law based on a permissible classification fulfills the guarantee of the equal 
protection of the laws and is valid. On the other hand if it is based on an impermissible 
classification it violates that guarantee and is void.  Reiterating the test of reasonable 
classification, the Supreme Court in Dharam Dutt v. Union of India, (2004) 1 SCC 712 
held that laying down of intelligible differentia does not, however mean that the 
legislative classification should be scientifically perfect or logically complete. 
Scope of Article 14 
The true meaning and scope of Article 14 has been explained in several 
decisions of the Supreme Court. The rules with respect to permissible 
classification as evolved in the various decisions have been summarised by 
the Supreme Court in Ram Kishan Dalmiya v. Justice Tendulkar, AIR 1958 SC, 
538 as follows: 
 
(i) Article 14 forbids class legislation, but does not 
forbid classification. 
 
(ii) Permissible 
classification 
must 
satisfy 
two 
conditions, namely, (a) it must be founded on an intelligible 
differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are 
grouped together from others left out of the group, and (b) 
the differentia must have a relation to the object sought to be achieved 
by the statute in question. 
 (iii) The classification may be founded on different basis, namely 
geographical, or according to objects or occupations or the like. 
 (iv) In permissible classification, mathematical nicety and perfect equality 
are not required. Similarly, non identity of treatment is enough. 
 (v) Even a single individual may be treated a class by himself on account 
of some special circumstances or reasons applicable to him and not 
applicable to others; a law may be constitutional even though it relates 
to a single individual who is in a class by himself. 
 (vi) Article 14 condemns discrimination not only by substantive law but by 
a law of procedure. 
 (vii) There is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of an 
enactment and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there 
has been a clear transgression of the constitutional principles. 
A remarkable example of the application of the principle of equality under the 
Constitution is the decision of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in R.K. 
Garg v. Union of India, AIR 1976 SC 1559. The legislation under attack was the 
Special Bearer Bonds (Immunities and Exemptions) Act, 1981. It permitted 
investment of black money in the purchase of these Bonds without any questions 
being asked as to how this money came into the possession. 
In a public interest litigation it was contended that Article 14 had been violated, 
because honest tax payers were adversely discriminated against by the Act, which 
EP-GCL-1 
14
legalized evasion. But the Supreme Court rejected the challenge, taking note of the 
magnitude of the problem of black money which had brought into being a parallel 
economy. 
Finally it should be mentioned that Article 14 invalidates discrimination not only in 
substantive law but also in procedure. Further, it applies to executive acts also. 
In the recent past, Article 14 has acquired new dimensions. In Maneka Gandhi v. 
Union of India, AIR 1978 SC 597, the Supreme Court held that Article 14 strikes at 
arbitrariness in State action and ensures a fairness and equality of treatment. The 
principle of reasonableness, which logically as well as philosophically, is an essential 
element of equality or non-arbitrariness pervades Article 14 like a brooding 
omnipresence (See also Ramana  Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority, 
AIR 1979 SC 1628; Kasturi Lal v. State of J&K, AIR 1980 SC 1992).  In Ajay Hasia v. 
Khalid  Mujib, AIR 1981SC 487, the Supreme Court held ― …. what Article 14 strikes 
at is arbitrariness because an action that is arbitrary must necessarily involve 
negation of equality….. Wherever therefore there is arbitrariness in State action 
whether it be of the legislature or of the executive or of an ―authority‖ under Article 12, 
Article 14 immediately springs into action and strikes down such action.‖  In this case 
the system of selection by oral interview, in addition to written test was upheld as 
valid, but allocation of above 15 per cent of the total marks for interview was regarded 
as arbitrary and unreasonable and liable to be struck down as constitutionally invalid. 
Possession of higher qualification can be treated as a valid base or classification 
of two categories of employees, even if no such requirement is prescribed at the time 
of recruitment.  If such a distinction is drawn no complaint can be made that it would 
violate Article 14 of the Constitution (U.P. State Sugar Corpn. Ltd. v. Sant Raj Singh, 
(2006) 9 SCC 82. 
In Secy., State of Karnataka v. Umadevi, (2006) 4 SCC 1, the Supreme Court 
has held that adherence to the rule of equality in public employment is a basic feature 
of our Constitution and since the rule of law is the core of our Constitution, a court 
would certainly be disabled from passing an order upholding the violation of Article 
14. 
Article 15: Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion etc. 
Article 15(1) prohibits the State from discriminating against any citizen on 
grounds only of: 
 (a) religion 
 (b) race 
 (c) caste 
 (d) sex 
 (e) place of birth or 
 
(f) any of them 
Article 15(2) lays down that no citizen shall be subjected to any disability, 
restriction or condition with regard to— 
 (a) access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of public 
entertainment; or 
 
EP-GCL-1 
15
 (b) the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places of public resort, 
maintained wholly or partially out of State funds or dedicated to the use of the 
general public. 
Article 15(3) and 15(4) create certain exceptions to the right guaranteed by 
Article 15(1) and 15(2). Under Article 15(3) the State can make special provision for 
women and children. It is under this provision that courts have upheld the validity of 
legislation or executive orders discriminating in favour of women (Union of India v. 
Prabhakaran, (1997) 2 SCC 633). 
Article 15(4) permits the State to make special provision for the advancement 
of— 
 (a) Socially and educationally backward classes of citizens; 
 (b) Scheduled casts; and 
 (c) Scheduled tribes. 
Article 16: Equality of opportunity in matters of public employment. 
Article 16(1) guarantees to all citizens equality of opportunity in matters relating 
to employment or appointment of office under the State. 
Article 16(2) prohibits discrimination against a citizen on the grounds of religion, 
race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth or residence. 
However, there are certain exceptions provided in Article 16(3), 16(4) and 16(5). 
These are as under: 
 (1) Parliament can make a law that in regard to a class or classes of 
employment or appointment to an office under the Government of a State on 
a Union Territory, under any local or other authority within the State or Union 
Territory, residence within that State or Union Territory prior to such 
employment or appointment shall be an essential qualification. [Article 16(3)] 
 (2) A provision can be made for the reservation of appointments or posts in 
favour of any backward class of citizens which in the opinion of the State is 
not adequately represented in the services under the State. [Article 16(4)] 
 (3) A law shall not be invalid if it provides that the incumbent of an office in 
connection with the affair of any religious or denominational institution or any 
member of the governing body thereof shall be a person professing a 
particular religion or belonging to a particular denomination. [Article 16(5)] 
The Supreme Court in Secy. of State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3) (2006) 4 
SCC 1 held that adherence to the rule of equality in public employment is a 
basic feature of the Constitution and since the rule of law is the core of the 
Constitution, a Court would certainly be disabled from passing an order 
upholding a violation of Article 14. Equality of opportunity is the hallmark and 
the Constitution has provided also for affirmative action to ensure that 
unequals are not treated as equals. Thus any public employment has to be in 
terms of the Constitutional Scheme.

Article 17: Abolition of untouchability 
Article 17 says that ―Untouchability‖ is abolished and its practice in any form is 
forbidden. The enforcement of any disability arising out of ―Untouchability‖ shall be an 
offence punishable in accordance with law. 
Untouchability does not include an instigation to social boycott (Davarajiah v. 
Padamanna, AIR 1961 Mad. 35, 39). Punishment for violation of Article 17 is to be 
provided by Parliament under Article 35(a)(ii).  
In 1955 Parliament enacted the Untouchability (Offences) Act 1955. In 1976, the 
Act was amended and renamed as the ―Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955‖ making 
changes in the existing law namely, all offences to be treated as non-compoundable 
and offences punishable upto three months to be tried summarily; punishment of 
offences enhanced; preaching of untouchability or its justification made an offence; a 
machinery envisaged for better administration and enforcement of its provisions. 
Article 18: Abolition of titles 
Article 18 is more a prohibition rather than a fundamental right. British 
Government used to confer titles upon persons who showed special allegiance to 
them. Many persons were made Sir, Raj Bahadur, Rai Saheb, Knight, etc. These 
titles had the effect of creating a class of certain persons which was regarded 
superior to others and thus had the effect of perpetuating inequality. To do away with 
that practice, now Article 18 provides as under: 
 
(i) No title, not being a military or academic distinction, shall be conferred by the 
State. 
 (ii) No citizen of India shall accept any title from any foreign State. 
 (iii) No person, who is not a citizen of India shall, while he holds any office or 
trust under the State, accept without the consent of the President, any title 
from any foreign State. 
 (iv) No person, holding any office of profit or trust under State shall without the 
consent of the President, accept any present, emolument or office of any kind 
from or under a foreign State. 
 
EP-GCL-1

It has been pointed out by the Supreme Court that the framers of the Constitution 
prohibited titles of nobility and all other titles that carry suffixes or prefixes, as they 
result in the distinct class of citizens. However, framers of the Constitution did not 
intend that the State should not officially recognise merit or work of an extra ordinary 
nature. The National awards are not violative of the principles of equality as 
guaranteed by the provisions of the Constitution. The theory of equality does not 
mandate that merit should not be recognised. The Court has held that the National 
awards do not amount to "titles" within the meaning of Article 18(1) and they should 
not be used as suffixes or prefixes. If this is done, the defaulter should forfeit the 
National award conferred on him/her, following the procedure laid down in regulation 
10 of each of the four notifications creating these National awards. 
6.  Rights Relating to Freedom 
Articles 19-22 guarantee certain fundamental freedoms. 
The six freedoms of citizens 
Article 19(1), of the Constitution, guarantees to the citizens of 
India six freedoms, namely: 
 
(a) freedom of speech and expression; 
 (b) assemble peaceably and without arms; 
 (c) form associations or unions 
 (d) move freely, throughout the territory of India; 
 (e) reside and settle in any part of the territory of India; 
 
(f) practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. 
These freedoms are those great and basic rights which are recognized as the 
natural rights inherent in the status of a citizen. At the same time, none of these 
freedoms is absolute but subject to reasonable restrictions specified under clauses 
(2) to (6) of the Article 19. The Constitution under Articles 19(2) to 19(6) permits the 
imposition of restrictions on these freedoms subject to the following conditions: 
 (a) The restriction can be imposed by law and not by a purely executive order 
issued under a statute; 
 (b) The restriction must be reasonable; 
 (c) The restriction must be imposed for achieving one or more of the objects 
specified in the respective clauses of Article 19. 
Reasonableness 
It is very important to note that the restrictions should be reasonable. If this word 
‗reasonable‘ is not there, the Government can impose any restrictions and they 
cannot be challenged. This word alone gives the right to an aggrieved person to 
challenge any restriction of the freedoms granted under this Article. 
Reasonableness of the restriction is an ingredient common to all the clauses of 
Article 19. Reasonableness is an objective test to be applied by the judiciary. 
Legislative judgment may be taken into account by the Court, but it is not conclusive.  
EP-GCL-1 
18
It is subject to the supervision of Courts.  The following factors are usually considered 
to assess the reasonableness of a law: 
 
(i) The objective of the restriction; 
 (ii) The nature, extent and urgency of the evil sought to be dealt with by the law 
in question; 
 (iii) How far the restriction is proportion to the evil in question 
 (iv) Duration of the restriction 
 (v) The conditions prevailing at the time when the law was framed. 
The onus of proving to the satisfaction of the Court that the restriction is 
reasonable is upon the State. 
Procedural and Substantiveness 
In determining the reasonableness of a law, the Court will not only see the 
surrounding circumstances, but all contemporaneous legislation passed as part of a 
single scheme. It is the reasonableness of the restriction and not of the law that has 
to be found out, and if the legislature imposes a restriction by one law but creates 
countervailing advantages by another law passed as part of the same legislative plan, 
the court can take judicial notice of such Acts forming part of the same legislative 
plan (Krishna Sagar Mills v. Union of India, AIR 1959 SC 316). 
The phrase ‗reasonable restrictions‘ connotes that the limitation imposed upon a 
person in the enjoyment of a right should not be arbitrary or of an excessive nature. 
In determining the reasonableness of a statute, the Court would see both the nature 
of the restriction and procedure prescribed by the statute for enforcing the restriction 
on the individual freedom. The reasonableness of a restriction has to be determined 
in an objective manner and from the point of view of the interests of the general 
public and not from the point of view of the persons upon whom the restrictions are 
imposed or upon abstract considerations. The Court is called upon to ascertain the 
reasonableness of the restrictions and not of the law which permits the restriction. 
The word ‗restriction‘ also includes cases of prohibition and the State can establish 
that a law, though purporting to deprive a person of his fundamental right, under 
certain circumstances amounts to a reasonable restriction only. Though the test of 
reasonableness laid down in clauses (2) to (6) of Article 19 might in great part 
coincide with that for judging ‗due process‘ under the American Constitution, it must 
not be assumed that these are identical. It has been held that the restrictions are 
imposed in carrying out the Directive Principles of State Policy is a point in favour of 
the reasonableness of the restrictions. 
Scope and Limitations on the Freedoms 
(a)  Right to freedom of speech and expression 
It need not to be mentioned as to how important the freedom of speech and 
expression in a democracy is. A democratic Government attaches a great importance 
to this freedom because without freedom of speech and expression the appeal to 
reason which is the basis of democracy cannot be made. The right to speech and 
expression includes right to make a good or bad speech and even the right of not to 
speak. One may express oneself even by signs. The Courts have held that this right 
 
EP-GCL-1 
19
includes the freedom of press and right to publish one‘s opinion, right to circulation 
and propagation of one‘s ideas, freedom of peaceful demonstration, dramatic 
performance and cinematography. It may also include any other mode of expression 
of one‘s ideas. The Supreme Court in Cricket Association of Bengal v. Ministry 
of Information & Broadcasting (Govt. of India), AIR 1995 SC 1236, has held that 
this freedom includes the right to communicate through any media - print, 
electronic and audio visual. 
The freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) means the right to 
express one‘s convictions and opinions freely by word of mouth, writing, printing, 
pictures or any other mode. This freedom includes the freedom of press as it 
partakes of the same basic nature and characteristic (Maneka Gandhi v. Union of 
India, AIR 1978 S.C. 597). However no special privilege is attached to the press as 
such, distinct from ordinary citizens. In Romesh Thapar v. State of Punjab, AIR 1950 
S.C. 124, it was observed that ―freedom of speech and of the press lay at the 
foundation of all democratic organisations, for without free political discussion no 
public education, so essential for the proper functioning of the process of popular 
Government is possible‖. Imposition of pre-censorship on publication under clause 
(2), is violative of freedom of speech and expression.  
The right to freedom of speech is infringed not only by a direct ban on the 
circulation of a publication but also by an action of the Government which would 
adversely affect the circulation of the paper. The only restrictions which may be 
imposed on the press are those which clause (2) of Article 19 permits and no other 
(Sakal Papers (P) Ltd. v. Union of India, AIR 1962 SC 305). 
Regarding Commercial advertisements it was held in Hamdard Dawakhana v. 
Union of India, AIR 1960 SC 554 that they do not fall within the protection of 
freedom of speech and expression because such advertisements have an 
element of trade and commerce. A commercial advertisement does not aim at 
the furtherance of the freedom of speech. Later the perception about 
advertisement changed and it has been held that commercial speech is a part 
of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) and 
such speech can also be subjected to reasonable restrictions only under 
Article 19(2) and not otherwise (Tata Press Ltd. v. MTNL, AIR 1995 SC 2438). 
The right to know, ‗receive and impart information‘ has been recognized within 
the right to freedom of speech and expression (S.P. Gupta v. President of India,  AIR 
1982 SC 149. A citizen has a fundamental right to use the best means of imparting 
and receiving information and as such to have an access to telecasting for the 
purpose. (Secretary, Ministry of I&B, Govt. of India v. Cricket Association of Bengal, 
(1995) 2 SCC 161) 
The right to reply, i.e. the right to get published one‘s reply in the same news 
media in which something is published against or in relation to a person has also 
been recognised under Article 19(1)(a), particularly when the news media is owned 
by the State within the meaning of Article 12. It has also been held that a Government 
circular having no legal sanction violates Article 19(1)(a), if it compels each and every 
pupil to join in the singing of the National Anthem despite his genuine, conscientious 
religious objection (Bijoe Emmanuel v. State of Kerala, (1986) 3 SCC 615). Impliedly 
the Court has recognised in Article 19(1)(a) the right to remain silent.  
EP-GCL-1 
20
The Supreme Court in Union of India v. Naveen Jindal, 
(2004) 2 SCC 476, has held that right to fly the National Flag 
freely with respect and dignity is a fundamental right of a 
citizen within the meaning of Article 19(1)(a) of the 
Constitution being an expression and manifestation of his 
allegiance and feelings and sentiments of pride for the 
nation.  
Dramatic performance is also a form of speech and expression. In K.A. Abbas v. 
Union of India, AIR 1971 S.C. 481, the Court held that censorship of films including 
(pre-censorship) is justified under Article 19(1)(a) and (2) of the Constitution but the 
restrictions must be reasonable. The right of a citizen to exhibit films on the 
Doordarshan subject to the terms and conditions to be imposed by the latter has also 
been recognized. (Odyssey Communications (P) Ltd. v. Lokvidayan Sangathan, AIR 
1988 SC 1642. 
Clause (2) of Article 19 specifies the limits upto which the freedom of speech and 
expression may be restricted. It enables the Legislature to impose by law reasonable 
restrictions on the freedom of speech and expression under the following heads: 
Permissible Restrictions  
 (1) Sovereignty and integrity of India. 
 (2) Security of the State. 
 (3) Friendly relations with foreign States. 
 (4) Public Order. 
 (5) Decency or morality or 
 (6) Contempt of court. 
 (7) Defamation or 
 (8) Incitement to an offence. 
Reasonable restrictions under these heads can be imposed only by a duly 
enacted law and not by the executive action (Express News Papers Pvt. Ltd. v. Union 
of India, (1986) 1 SCC 133). 
Corporations 
The Supreme Court, initially expressed the view that a Corporation is not a 
citizen within the meaning of Article 19 and, therefore, cannot invoke this Article. 
Subsequently the Supreme Court held that a company is a distinct and separate 
entity from its shareholders and refused to tear the corporate veil for determing the 
constitutionality of the legislation by judging its impact on the fundamental rights of 
the shareholders of the company (TELCO v. State of Bihar, AIR 1965 S.C. 40). But a 
significant modification is made by the Supreme Court in R.C. Cooper v. Union of 
India, AIR 1970 S.C. 564 (also called the Bank Nationalisation case). The Supreme 
Court ruled that the test in determining whether the shareholder‘s right is impaired is 
not formal but is essentially qualitative. If the State action impaired the rights of the 
shareholders as well as of the company, the Court will not deny itself jurisdiction to 
grant relief. The shareholders‘ rights are equally affected, if the rights of the company 
are affected (Bennett Coleman & Co., AIR (1973) S.C. 106). 
 
EP-GCL-1 
21
(b)  Freedom of assembly 
The next right is the right of citizens to assemble peacefully and without arms 
[Art. 19(1)(b)].  Calling an assembly and putting one‘s views before it is also 
intermixed with the right to speech and expression discussed above, and in a 
democracy it is of no less importance than speech. However, apart from the fact that 
the assembly must be peaceful and without arms, the State is also authorised to 
impose reasonable restrictions on this right in the interests of: 
 
(i) the sovereignty and integrity of India, or 
 (ii) public order. 
Freedom of assembly is an essential element in a democratic Government. In the 
words of Chief Justice Waite of the Supreme Court of America, ―the very idea of 
Government, republican in form, implies a right on the part of citizens to meet 
peaceably for consultation in respect of public affairs‖. The purpose of public 
meetings being the education of the public and the formation of opinion on religious, 
social, economic and political matters, the right of assembly has a close affinity to 
that of free speech under Article 19(1)(a). 
(c)  Freedom of association 
The freedom of association includes freedom to hold meeting and to takeout 
processions without arms. Right to form associations for unions is also guaranteed so 
that people are free to have the members entertaining similar views [Art. 19(1)(c)]. 
This right is also, however, subject to reasonable restrictions which the State may 
impose in the interests of: 
 
(i) the sovereignty and integrity of India, or 
 (ii) public order, or 
 (iii) morality. 
A question not yet free from doubt is whether the fundamental right to form 
association also conveys the freedom to deny to form an association. In Tikaramji v. 
Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1956 SC 676, the Supreme Court observed that assuming 
the right to form an association “implies a right not to form an association, it 
does not follow that the negative right must also be regarded as a fundamental 
right”. However, the High Court of Andhra Pradesh has held, that this right 
necessarily implies a right not to be a member of an association. Hence, the rules 
which made it compulsory for all teachers of elementary schools to become members 
of an association were held to be void as being violative of Article 19(1)(c) 
(Sitharamachary v. Sr. Dy. Inspector of Schools, AIR 1958 A.P. 78). This view gets 
support from O.K. Ghosh v. Joseph, AIR 1963 SC 812.  It has been held that a right 
to form associations or unions does not include within its ken as a fundamental right a 
right to form associations or unions for achieving a particular object or running a 
particular institution (2004) 1 SCC 712. 
(d)  Freedom of movement 
Right to move freely throughout the territory of India is another right guaranteed 
under Article 19(1)(d). This right, however, does not extend to travel abroad, and like 
EP-GCL-1 
22
other rights stated above, it is also subject to the reasonable restrictions which the 
State may impose: 
 
(i) in the interests of the general public, or 
 (ii) for the protection of the interests of any scheduled tribe. 
A law authorising externment or interment to be valid must fall within the limits of 
permissible legislation in clause (5), namely restrictions must be reasonable and in 
the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of the 
Scheduled Tribes. 
(e)  Freedom of residence 
Article 19(1)(e) guarantees to a citizen the right to reside and settle in any part of 
the territory of India. This right overlaps the right guaranteed by clause (d). This 
freedom is said to be intended to remove internal barriers within the territory of India 
to enable every citizen to travel freely and settle down in any part of a State or Union 
territory. This freedom is also subject to reasonable restrictions in the interests of 
general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe under 
Article 19(5). That apart, citizens can be subjected to reasonable restrictions 
(Ebrahim v. State of Bom., (1954) SCR 923, 950). Besides this, certain areas may be 
banned for certain kinds of persons such as prostitutes (State of U.P. v. Kaushaliya, 
AIR 1964 SC 416, 423). 
[(f) Right to acquire, hold and dispose of property — deleted by 44th 
Amendment in 1978.] 
(g)  Freedom to trade and occupations 
Article 19(1)(g) provides that all citizens shall have the right to practise any 
profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. 
An analysis of the case law reveals that the emphasis of the Courts has been on 
social control and social policy. However, no hard and fast rules have been laid down 
by the Court for interpreting this Article. The words ‘trade’, ‘business’, ‘profession’ 
used in this Article have received a variety of interpretations. The word ‗trade‘ has 
been held to include the occupation of men in buying and selling, barter or 
commerce, work, especially skilled, thus of the widest scope (Safdarjung Hospital v. 
K.S. Sethi, AIR 1970 S.C. 1407). 
The word ‗business‘ is more comprehensive than the word ‗trade‘. Each case 
must be decided according to its own circumstances, applying the common sense 
principle as to what business is. A profession on the other hand, has been held 
ordinarily as an occupation requiring intellectual skill, often coupled with manual skill. 
Like other freedoms discussed above, this freedom is also subject to reasonable 
restrictions. Article 19(6) provides as under : 
Nothing in sub-clause (g) shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as 
it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, in the interests of the 
general public, reasonable restrictions in the exercise of the right conferred by the 
said sub-clause, and in particular, nothing in the said sub-clause shall affect the 
operation of any existing law in so far as it relates to, or prevent the State from 
 
EP-GCL-1 
23
making any law relating to— 
 
(i) the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any 
profession or carrying on any occupation, trade or business, or 
 (ii) the carrying on by the State, or by a corporation owned or controlled by the 
State, of any trade, industry or service whether to the exclusion, complete or 
partial, of citizens or otherwise. 
Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution guarantees that all citizens have the right to 
practice any profession or to carry on any occupation or trade or business. The 
freedom is not uncontrolled, for, clause (6) of the Article authorises legislation which 
(i) imposes reasonable restrctions on this freedom in the interests of the general 
public; (ii) prescribes professional or technical qualifications necessary for carrying on 
any profession, trade or business; and (iii) enables the State to carry on any trade or 
business to the exclusion of private citizens, wholly or partially. 
In order to determine the reasonableness of the restriction, regard must be had to 
the nature of the business and conditions prevailing in that trade. It is obvious that 
these factors differ from trade to trade, and no hard and fast rules concerning all 
trades can be laid down. The word ‗restriction‘ used in clause (6) is wide enough to 
include cases of total prohibition also. Accordingly, even if the effect of a law is the 
elimination of the dealers from the trade, the law may be valid, provided it satisfies 
the test of reasonableness or otherwise. 
The vital principle which has to kept in mind is that the restrictive law should 
strike a proper balance between the freedom guaranteed under Article 19(1)(g) and 
the social control permitted by clause (6) of Article 19. The restriction must not be of 
an exessive nature beyond what is required in the interests of the public. 
Monopoly 
The Supreme Court‟s decision in Chintamana Rao v. State of M.P., AIR 1951 
S.C. 118 is a leading case on the point where the constitutionality of Madhya 
Pradesh Act was challenged. The State law prohibited the manufacture of bidis 
in the villages during the agricultural season. No person 
residing in the village could employ any other person nor 
engage himself, in the manufacture of bidis during the 
agricultural season. The object of the provision was to 
ensure adequate supply of labour for agricultural purposes. 
The bidi manufacturer could not even import labour from 
outside, and so, had to suspend manufacture of bidis during 
the agricultural season. Even villagers incapable of engaging in agriculture, 
like old people, women and children, etc., who supplemented their income by 
engaging themselves manufacturing bidis were prohibited without any reason. 
The prohibition was held to be unreasonable. 
However, after the Constitutional (Amendment) Act, 1951, the State can create a 
monopoly in favour of itself and can compete with private traders. It has been held in 
Assn. of Registration Plates v. Union of India, (2004) SCC 476 that the State is free 
to create monopoly in favour of itself. However the entire benefit arising therefrom 
must ensure to the benefit of the State and should not be used as a clock for 
conferring private benefit upon a limited class of persons. 
EP-GCL-1 
24
(a)  Protection in respect of conviction for offences 
Articles 20, 21 and 22 provide a system of protection,  relevant to the 
criminal law. Article 20 guarantees to all persons — whether citizens 
or non-citizens-three rights namely:— 
(i)  Protection against ex-post facto laws 
According to Article 20(1), no person shall be convicted of any 
offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act 
charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might 
have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the 
offence. 
Ex-post facto laws are laws which punished what had been lawful when done. If 
a particular act was not an offence according to the law of the land at the time when 
the person did that act, then he cannot be convicted under a law which with 
retrospective declares that act as an offence. For example, what was not an offence 
in 1972 cannot be declared as an offence under a law made in 1974 giving operation 
to such law from a back date, say from 1972. 
Even the penalty for the commission of an offence cannot be increased with 
retrospective effect. For example, suppose for committing dacoity the penalty in 1970 
was 10 years imprisonment and a person commits dacoity in that year. By a law 
passed after his committing the dacoity the penalty, for his act cannot be increased 
from 10 to 11 years or to life imprisonment. 
In Shiv Bahadur Singh v. State of Vindhya Pradesh, AIR 1953 S.C. 394, it was 
clarified that Article 20(1) prohibited the conviction under an ex post facto law, and 
that too the substantive law. This protection is not available with respect to procedural 
law. Thus, no one has a vested right in procedure. A law which nullifies the rigour of 
criminal law is not affected by the rule against ex post facto law (Rattan Lal v. State of 
Punjab, (1964) 7 S.C.R. 676). 
(ii)  Protection against double jeopardy 
According to Article 20(2), no person shall be prosecuted and punished for the 
same offence more than once. It is, however, to be noted that the conjunction "and" is 
used between the words prosecuted and punished, and therefore, if a person has 
been let off after prosecution without being punished, he can be prosecuted again. 
(iii)  Protection against self-incrimination 
According to Article 20(3), no person accused of any offence shall be compelled 
to be a witness against himself. In other words, an accused cannot be compelled to 
state anything which goes against him. But it is to be noted that a person is entitled to 
this protection, only when all the three conditions are fulfilled: 
 
1. that he must be accused of an offence; 
 
2. that there must be a compulsion to be a witness; and 
 
3. such compulsion should result in his giving evidence against himself. 
So, if the person was not an accused when he made a statement or the 
statement was not made as a witness or it was made by him without compulsion and 
does not result as a statement against himself, then the protection available under 
this provision does not extend to such person or to such statement. 
 
EP-GCL-1 
25
The ‗right against self-incrimination‘ protects persons who have been formally 
accused as well as those who are examined as suspects in criminal cases. It also 
extends to cover witnesses who apprehend that their answers could expose them to 
criminal charges in the ongoing investigation or even in cases other than the one 
being investigated. [Selvi v. State of Karnataka, AIR 2010 SC 1974]. 
(b)  Protection of life and personal liberty 
Article 21 confers on every person the fundamental right to life and personal 
liberty. It says that, 
―No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to 
procedure established by law.‖ 
The right to life includes those things which make life meaningful. For example, 
the right of a couple to adopt a son is a constitutional right guaranteed under Article 
21 of the Constitution (see, Philips Alfred Malvin v. Y.J. Gonsalvis and others, AIR 
1999 Ker. 187). The right to life enshrined in Article 21 guarantees right to live with 
human dignity. Right to live in freedom from noise pollution is a fundamental right 
protected by Article 21 and noise pollution beyond permissible limits is an inroad into 
that right. (Noise Pollution (v), in re, (2005) 5 SCC 733.  
The majority in the case of A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras, AIR 1950 SC 
27, gave a narrow meaning to the expression „personal liberty‟ within the 
subject matter of Articles 20 to 22 by confining it to the liberty of the person 
(that is, of the body of a person). The majority of the judges also took a narrow 
view of the expression ‘procedure established by law’ in this case. In the State 
of Maharashtra v. Prabhakar Pandurang Sanzigri, AIR 1966, SC 424, Subba Rao 
J. considered the inter-relation between Articles 19 and 21 as was discussed by 
the majority Judges in the A.K. Gopalan’s case and came to the conclusion that 
“that view was not the last word on the subject”. 
The expression ‗liberty‘ in the 5th and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution 
has been given a very wide meaning. The restricted interpretation of the expression 
‗personal liberty‘ preferred by the majority judgement in A.K. Gopalan’s case namely, 
that the expression ‗personal liberty‘ means only liberty relating to or concerning the 
person or body of the individual, has not been accepted by the Supreme Court in 
subsequent cases. 
That the expression „personal liberty‟ is not limited to 
bodily restraint or to confinement to prison, only is well 
illustrated in Kharak Singh v. State of U.P, AIR 1963 SC 
1295. In that case the question raised was of the validity of 
the police regulations authorising the police to conduct 
what are called as domiciliary visits against bad characters 
and to have surveillance over them. The court held that 
such visits were an invasion, on the part of the police, of the 
sanctity of a man‟s home and an intrusion into his personal security and his right 
to sleep, and therefore violative of the personal liberty of the individual, unless 
authorised by a valid law. As regards the regulations authorising surveillance 
over the movements of an individual the court was of the view that they were not 
bad, as no right to privacy has been guaranteed in the Constitution.  
EP-GCL-1 
26
However, in Gobind v. State of M.P., AIR 1975 S.C. 1378, Mathew, J. asserted that 
the right to privacy deserves to be examined with care and to be denied only when an 
important countervailing interest is shown to be superior, and observed that this right 
will have to go through a process of case-by-case development. Mathew, J. explained 
that even assuming that the right to personal liberty, the right to move freely throughout 
the territory of India and the freedom of speech create an independent right to privacy 
as emanating from them, the right is not absolute and it must be read subject to 
restrictions on the basis of compelling public interest. 
Refusal of an application to enter a medical college cannot be said to affect 
person‘s personal liberty under Article 21 (State of A.P. v. L. Narendranathan, (1971) 
1 S.C.C. 607). 
In Satwant Singh Sawhney v. A.P.O., New Delhi, AIR 1967 S.C. 1836, it was 
held that right to travel is included within the expression ‗personal liberty‘ and, 
therefore, no person can be deprived of his right to travel, except according to the 
procedure established by law. Since a passport is essential for the enjoyment of that 
right, the denial of a passport amounts to deprivation of personal liberty. In the 
absence of any procedure pescribed by the law of land sustaining the refusal of a 
passport to a person, it‘s refusal amounts to an unauthorised deprivation of personal 
liberty guaranteed by Article 21. This decision was accepted by the Parliament and 
the infirmity was set right by the enactment of the Passports Act, 1967. 
It was stated in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, AIR 1978 S.C. 597, that 
„personal liberty‟ within the meaning of Article 21 includes within its ambit the 
right to go abroad, and no person can be deprived of this 
right except according to procedure prescribed by law. In 
this case, it was clearly laid down that the fundamental 
rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution are not 
distinct and mutually exclusive. Thus, a law depriving a 
person of personal liberty and prescribing a procedure for 
that purpose within the meaning of Article 21 has still to 
stand the test of one or more of fundamental rights conferred by Article 19 
which may be applicable to a given situation. 
Procedure established by law: The expression ‗procedure established by law‘ 
means procedure laid down by statute or procedure prescribed by the law of the 
State. Accordingly, first, there must be a law justifying interference with the person‘s 
life or personal liberty, and secondly, the law should be a valid law, and thirdly, the 
procedure laid down by the law should have been strictly followed. 
The law laid down in A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras, AIR 1950 SC 27, that 
the expression „procedure established by law‟ means only the procedure 
enacted by a law made by the State was held to be incorrect in the Bank 
Nationalisation Case (1970) 1 S.C.C. 248. Subsequently, in Maneka Gandhi's 
case (AIR 1978 SC 49), it was laid down, that the law must now be taken to be 
well settled that Article 21 does not exclude Article 19 and a law prescribing a 
procedure for depriving a person of „personal liberty‟ will have to meet the 
requirements of Article 21 and also of Article 19, as well as of Article 14. 
The procedure must be fair, just and reasonable. It must not be arbitrary fanciful 
or oppressive. An interesting, follow-up of the Maneka Gandhi's case came in a 
series of cases. 
 
EP-GCL-1 
27
In Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR 1980 S.C. 898, it was reiterated that in 
Article 21 the founding fathers recognised the right of the State to deprive a person of 
his life or personal liberty in accordance with fair, just and reasonable procedure 
established by valid law. 
Presently, this term personal liberty extends to variety of matters like right to bail, 
right not to be handcuffed except under very few cases, right to speedy trial, right to 
free legal aid etc. 
7. Article 21A: Right to Education 
This was introduced by the Constitution (Eighty sixth Amendment) Act, 
2002. According to this, the State shall provide free and compulsory 
education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years in such 
manner as the State may, by law, determine. 
 
Protection against arrest and detention 
Although Article 21 does not impose a limitation on the legislature in so far as the 
deprivation of life or personaly liberty is concerned, yet a legislative Act providing for 
such deprivation is subject to the procedureal safeguards provided in Article 22 and if 
it does not provide for any of these safeguards it shall be declared unconstitutional. 
However, Article 22 does not apply uniformly to all persons and makes a distinction 
between: 
 (a) alien enemies, 
 (b) person arrested or detained under preventive detention law, and 
 (c) other persons. 
So far as alien enemies are concerned the article provides no protection to them. 
So far as persons in category (c) are concerned, it provides the following rights 
(These rights are not given to persons detained under preventive detention law). 
 
(i) A person who is arrested cannot be detained in custody unless he has been 
informed, as soon as he may be, of the grounds for such arrest. 
 (ii) Such person shall have the right to consult and to be defended by a legal 
practitioner of his choice. 
 (iii) A person who is arrested and detained must be produced before the nearest 
magistrate within a period of twenty-four hours of such arrest, excluding the 
time of journey. And such a person shall not be detained in custody beyond 
twenty-four hours without the authority of magistrate. 
Preventive Detention 
Preventive detention means detention of a person without trial. The object of 
preventive detention is not to punish a person for having done something but to 
prevent him from doing it. No offence is proved nor any charge formulated and yet a 
person is detained because he is likely to commit an act prohibited by law. Parliament 
has the power to make a law for preventive detention for reasons connected with 
defence, foreign affairs or the security of India. Parliament and State Legislatures are 
both entitled to pass a law of preventive detention for reasons connected with the 
security of State, the maintenance of public order, or the maintenance of supplies and 
services essential to the community.

Safeguards against Preventive Detention 
Article 22 (amended by the 44th Constitution Amendment Act, 1978)1 contains 
following safeguards against preventive detention: 
 (a) such a person cannot be detained for a longer period than three months 
unless: 
 
(i) An Advisory Board constituted of persons who are or have been or are 
qualified to be High Court judges has reported, before the expiration of 
the said period of three months that there is, in its opinion sufficient 
cause for such detention. 
 
(ii) Parliament may by law prescribe the maximum period for which any 
person may in any class or classes of cases be detained under any law 
providing for preventive detention and the procedure to be followed by an 
Advisory Board. 
 (b) The authority ordering the detention of a person under the preventive 
detention law shall: 
 
(i) communicate to him, as soon as may be, the grounds on which the order 
for his detention has been made, and 
 
(ii) afford him the earliest opportunity of making the representation against 
the order. 
It may, however, be noted that while the grounds for making the order are to be 
supplied, the authority making such order is not bound to disclose those facts which it 
considers to be against the public interest.

This group of fundamental rights consists of Articles 23 and 24. They provide for 
rights against exploitation of all citizens and non-citizens. Taking them one by one

EP-GCL-1 
29
they guarantee certain rights by imposing certain prohibitions not only against the 
State but also against private persons. 
(a)  Prohibition of traffic in human beings and forced labour 
Article 23 imposes a complete ban on traffic in human beings, federal and other 
similar  forms  of  forced  labour.  The  contravention  of  these  provisions is declared 
punishable by law. Thus the traditional system of beggary particularly in villages, 
becomes unconstitutional and a person who is asked to do any labour without 
payment or even a labourer with payment against his desire can complain against the 
violation of his fundamental right under Article 23. 
‗Traffic‘ in human beings means to deal in men and women like goods, such as to 
sell or let or otherwise dispose them of. ‗Begar‘ means involuntary work without 
payment. 
The State can impose compulsory service for public purposes such as 
conscription for defence for social service etc. While imposing such compulsory 
service the State cannot make any discrimination on grounds only of religion, race, 
caste or class or any of them. (Clause 2 of Article 23). 
(b)  Prohibition of employment of children 
Article 24 prohibits the employment of children below the age of fourteen in any 
factory or mine. The Employment of Children Act, 1938; The Factories Act, 1948; The 
Mines Act, 1952; The Apprentices‘ Act, 1961; and the Child Labour (Prohibition and 
Regulation) Act, 1986 are some of the important enactments in the statute book to 
protect the children from exploitation by unscrupulous employers. 
The Supreme Court has issued detailed guidelines as to child labour in M.C. 
Mehta v. State of T.N., AIR 1993 S.C. 699. 
9.  Right to Freedom of Religion 
With Article 25 begins a group of provisions ensuring equality of all religions 
thereby promoting secularism. 
Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of 
religion. 
Article 25 gives to every person the: 
 
(i) freedom of conscience, and 
 (ii) the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion. 
But this freedom is subject to restrictions imposed by the State on the following 
grounds: 
 
(i) public order, morality and health, 
 (ii) other provisions in Part III of the Constitution, 
 (iii) any law regulating or restricting any economic, financial political or other 
secular activity which may be associated with religious practice, and 
 (iv) any law providing for social welfare and reform or the throwing open of Hindu 
religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of 
Hindus. 
The Supreme Court in State of Karnataka v. Dr. Praveen Bhai Thogadia, (2004) 
9 SCC 684, held that secularism means that State should have no religion of its own 
EP-GCL-1 
30
and each person, whatever his religion, must get an assurance from the State that he 
has the protection of law to freely profess, practise and propagate his religion and 
freedom of conscience. 
The freedom of religion conferred by the present Article is not confined to the 
citizens of India but extends to all persons including aliens and individuals exercising 
their rights individually or through institutions (Ratilal v. State of Bombay, (1954) SCR 
105, Stanslaus v. State, AIR 1975 M. 163). 
The term ‗Hindu‘ here includes person professing the Sikh, Jain, or Buddhist 
religion also and accordingly the term ‗Hindu religious institutions‘ also includes the 
institutions belonging to these religions. Special right has been accorded to the Sikhs 
to wear kirpan as part of professing their religion. 
(a) The Concept of Religion 
Our Constitution does not define the word religion. Religion is certainly a matter 
of faith with individuals or communities and it is not necessarily theistic — There are 
well-known religions in India like Buddhism and Jainism which do not believe in God 
or in any Intelligent First Cause. A religion undoubtedly has its basis in any system of 
beliefs or doctrines which are regarded by those who profess that religion as 
conducive to their spiritual well being, but it would not be correct to say that religion is 
nothing else but a doctrine or belief. A religion may not only lay down a code of 
ethical rules for its follower to accept, it might prescribe rituals and observances, 
ceremonies and modes or worship which are regarded as integral parts of religion 
and those forms and observances might extend even to matters of food and dress 
(Justice Mukherjee in Commr. of H.R.E., Madras v. Sirur Mutt, A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 282). 
(b)  Freedom to manage religious affairs 
Although no clear cut distinction is possible, yet it may be said that while Article 
25 discussed above protects the religious freedom of individuals. Article 26, deals 
with the collective rights of religious denominations. Here the question may be raised 
as to what is a religious denomination? In the words of our Supreme Court: 
“The word ‘denomination’ has been defined in the Oxford Dictionary to mean a 
collection of individuals classed together under the 
same name: a religious sect or body having a common 
faith and organisation and designated by a distinctive 
name. It is well known that the practice of setting up 
Maths as centres of theological teaching was started by 
Shri Sankaracharya and was followed by various 
teachers since then. After Sankaracharya, came a galaxy 
of religious teachers and philosophers who founded the different sects and 
sub-sects of the Hindu religion that we find in India at the present day. Each 
one of such sects or sub-sects can certainly be called a religious 
denomination, as it is designated by a distinctive name, in many cases it is the 
name of the founder and has a common faith and common spiritual 
organization. The followers of Ramanuja, who are known by the name of Shri 
Vaishnavas, undoubtedly constitute a religious denomination, and so do the 
followers of Madhavacharya and other religious teachers" (Mukherjee J. in 
Commr. of H.R.E., Madras v. Sirur Mutt., A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 282). 
 
EP-GCL-1 
31
However, a religious denomination is not a ‗citizen‘. Now coming to the provisions 
of Article 26, it grants to every religious denomination or any sect thereof the right— 
 
(i) to establish and maintain institutions of religious and charitable purposes; 
 (ii) to manage its own affairs in matters of religion; 
 (iii) to own and acquire movable and immovable property; and 
 (iv) to administer such property in accordance with law. 
All these rights are subject to public order, morality and health, and, therefore, if 
they conflict then the right will give way to these exceptions. One more exception may 
be noted. A denomination‘s right to manage its own affairs in matters of religion is 
subject to the State‘s power to throw open Hindu religious institutions of a public 
nature to all classes or sections of Hindus covered in Article 25. 
(c)  Freedom as to payment of tax for the promotion of any particular religion 
According to Article 27, no person can be compelled to pay any taxes, the 
proceeds of which are specially appropriated in payment of expenses for the 
promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination. It is 
notable that freedom not to pay taxes is only with respect to those taxes the proceeds 
of which are specially appropriated in payment of expenses for the promotion or 
maintenance of any particular religion or denomination. 
(d) Freedom as to attendance at religious instruction or religious worship in 
educational institutions 
Article 28 prohibits religious instruction in certain educational institutions and 
gives freedom to a person to participate in such religious instructions. The Article 
states that— 
 
(i) No religious instruction can be provided in any educational instituion wholly 
maintained out of State funds. However, this prohibiton does not extend to an 
educational institution which is administered by the State but has been 
established under any endowment or trust which requires that religious 
instruction shall be imparted in such institution. 
 (ii) No person attending an educational institution recognised by the State or 
receiving aid out of State funds cannot be required: 
 
(a) to take part in any religious instruction that may be imparted in such 
institution; or 
 
(b) to attend any religious worship that may be conducted in such institution 
or any premises attached thereto, 
unless such person or if such person is a minor, his guardian has given his consent 
thereto. It may, however, be noted that although person can be compelled to take 
religious instructions or attend worship, without his consent, yet at the same time 
such person is not entitled to perform any religious ceremony or worship which is 
contrary to the tenets of that educational institution (Sanjib v. St. Paul’s College, 61 
C.W.N. 71).

10.  Cultural and Educational Rights [Rights of Minorities] 
Minority 
The word ‗minority‘ has not been defined in the Constitution. The Supreme Court 
in D.A.V. College, Jullundur v. State of Punjab, A.I.R. 1971, S.C. 1737, seems to 
have stated the law on the point. It said that minority should be determined in relation 
to a particular impugned legislation. The determination of minority should be based 
on the area of operation of a particular piece of legislation. If it is a State law, the 
population of the State should be kept in mind and if it is a Central Law the population 
of the whole of India should be taken into account. 
The two Articles guarantee the following rights: 
(a)  Protection of interests of Minorities 
Article 29 guarantees two rights: 
 
(i) Any section of the citizens residing in the territory of India or any part thereof 
having a distinct language, script or culture of its own has the right to 
conserve the same. Thus, citizens from Tamil Nadu or Bengal has the right to 
conserve their language or culture if they are living in Delhi, a Hindi speaking 
area and vice versa.  
 (ii) No citizen can be denied admission into any educational institution 
maintained by the State or receiving aid out of State funds on grounds only of 
religion, race, caste, language, or any of them. This provision is general and 
applies to each citizen individually and is not confined to a group of citizens. 
An exception is made to this right to the effect that if a special provision is 
made for the admission of persons belonging to educationally or/and socially 
backward classes or scheduled castes or scheduled tribes it shall be valid. 
(b)  Right of Minorities to establish and administer educational institutions 
The rights guaranteed to the minorities in Article 30 are even more important than 
those covered by Article 29. Following rights are declared in Article 30 : 
 
(i) All minorities, whether based on religion or on language, shall have the right 
to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. It may be 
noted here that this right is not limited only to linguistic minorities but it 
extends to religious minorities also. Both of them have been given the 
freedom to establish and administer educational institutions of their own 
choice. So they can establish educational institution of any type and cannot 
be restrained from its administration. The maladministration may be checked 
by the State but administration cannot be entrusted to outside hands. Mal-
administration defeats the very object of Article 30, which is to promote 
 
EP-GCL-1 
33
excellence of minority institutions in the field of education (All Saints High 
School v. Government of A.P., AIR 1980 SC 1042). And in that educational 
institution they may teach religion, or may give secular education, but no bar 
can be imposed on their choice. In the matter of medium of instruction also, 
the minorities are completely free to adopt any medium of their choice. 
 (ii) The State cannot, in granting aid to educational institutions, discriminate 
against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the 
management of a minority, whether based on religion or language. It has 
been held that the State cannot impose conditions in granting aid to such 
institutions. Further, the minority institutions are also entitled to recognition 
and the State cannot deny them that right, merely because they do not follow 
the directions of the State which impair rights under Article 30 (In re. Kerala 
Education Bill 1957, A.I.R. 1958 S.C. 956; Sidhrajbhai v. State of Gujarat, 
A.I.R. 1963 S.C. 540). 
In DAV College v. State of Punjab, AIR 1971 SC 1737, it was held that any 
community—religious or linguistic, which is numerically less than 50 percent 
of the population of that State, is a minority within the meaning of Article 30. 
The expression minority in Article 30(1) is used as distinct from „Any sections 
of citizens‟ in Article 29(1) which lends support to the view that Article 30(1) 
deals with national minorities or minorities recognised in the context of the 
entire nation (St. Xaviers College v. State of Gujarat, AIR 1974 SC 1389). 
The right conferred on religious and linguistic minorities to adminster educational 
institutions of their choice, though couched in absolute terms, is not free from 
regulation. Delhi High Court in Delhi Abibhavak Mahasangh v. U.O.I. and others AIR 
1999 Delhi 124 held that Article 30(1) of the Constitution does not permit, minorities 
to indulge in commercialisation of education in the garb of constitutional protection. 
For the application of this right minority institutions are divided into three classes: (i) 
institution which neither seek aid nor recognition from the State; (ii) institution that 
seek aid from the State; and (iii) institutions which seek recognition but not aid. While 
the institutions of class (i) cannot be subjected to any regulations except those 
emanating from the general law of the land such as labour, contract or tax laws, the 
institutions in classes (ii) and (iii) can be subjected to regulations pertaining to the 
academic standards and to the better administration of the institution, in the interest 
of that institution itself. 
In T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka (2002) 8 SCC 481, is an eleven 
Bench decision dealing with right of minorities to establish and administer 
educational institutions and correctness of the decision in St. Stephen’s 
College case. While interpreting Article 30, the Supreme 
Court held that minority includes both linguistic and 
religious minorities and for determination of minority status, 
the unit would be the State and not whole of India. Further, 
the right of minorities to establish and administer 
educational institutions (including professional education) 
was not absolute and regulatory measures could be 
imposed for ensuring educational standards and maintaining excellence 
thereof. Right of minorities included right to determine the procedure and 
method of admission and selection of students, which should be fair and 
transparent and based on merit. 
EP-GCL-1 
34
The Constitution (44th Amendment Act) has introduced new sub-clause (1A) 
which provides that wherever compulsory acquisition of any property of an 
educational institution established and administered by a minority is provided under 
any law, the State shall ensure that the amout fixed by or determined under any such 
law is such as would not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed under this Article. 
11.  Articles 31A, 31B and 31C relating to Property 
Right to property is no more a fundamental right which was previously 
guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution by Article 31. 
But the right to property has been inserted by Article 300A under Part XII of the 
Constitution. Article 300A reads — ―No person shall be deprived of his property save 
by authority of law‖. 
Saving of Laws Providing for Acquisition of Estates etc. 
Then follows Article 31A which is an exception to the right of equality as 
guaranteed in Article 14 and to the six freedoms as guaranteed in Article 19, if they 
come into conflict with any law mentioned in Article 31A. 
Such laws are those which provide for— 
 
(i) the acquisition by the State of any estate or any rights therein or the 
extinguishment or modification of any such rights. ‗Estate‘ here means the 
property included within that expression according to the land tenurers 
applicable in the area where it is situated. And ‗rights‘ in relation to an estate 
means proprietory and other intermediary rights. In short, such laws are 
those which related to agrarian reforms, or 
 (ii) the taking over of the management of any property by the State for a limited 
period in the public interest or in order to secure the proper management of 
the property, or 
 (iii) the amalgamation of two or more corporations either in the public interest or 
in order to secure the proper management of any of the corporations, or 
 (iv) the extinguishment or modification of any rights of managing agents, 
secretaries and treasurers, managing directors or managers of corporations, 
or of any voting rights of shareholders thereof, or 
 (v) the extinguishment or modification of any rights accruing by virtue of any 
agreement, lease or licence for the purpose of searching for, or winning any 
mineral or mineral oil or the premature termination or cancellation of any 
such agreement, lease or licence. 
However, limitations, have been imposed with respect to the laws relating to the 
acquisition of the estates. They are: 
 (a) If such a law is made by a State Legislature then it cannot be protected by 
the provisions of Article 31A unless such law having been reserved for the 
consideration of the President has received his assent, and 
 (b) If the law provides for the acquisition of (i) any land within the ceiling limit 
applicable in that area, (ii) any building or structure standing thereon or 
apartment thereto, it (law) shall not be valid unless it provides for payment of 
compensation at a rate which shall not be less than the market value thereof. 
 
EP-GCL-1 
35
This provision, however, has been amended by the Constitution (29th 
Amendment) Act. 
Validation of certain Acts and Regulations 
Article 31B certain laws against attack on the ground of violation of any 
fundamental rights. The laws so protected are specified in the Nineth Schedule to the 
Constitution. These laws also relate mainly to land reforms. 
Saving of Laws giving effect to certain Directive Principles 
Article 31C added by 25th Amendment of the Constitution lifted to the 
constitutional limitations on the powers of State, imposed by Article 14 (equality 
before law) and Article 19 (freedoms) as regards law giving effect to the policy of the 
State towards securing the principles — specified in clause (b) or clause (c) of Article 
39. These principles are— 
 
(i) that the ownership and control of the matenal resources of the community 
are so distributed as best to subserve the common good, and 
 (ii) that the operation of the economic system does not result in the 
concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment. 
The issue whether the 24th, 25th and 29th Amendments made by Parliament 
were valid or not was raised in the Supreme Court. In [Kesavananda Bharti v. State 
of Kerala, (1973) S.C.C. 225], the majority judgement (of a full bench of 13 judges) 
upheld the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution provided it did not alter its 
basic framework. 
By the 42nd Amendment in Article 31-C for the words the principles specified in 
clause (a) or clause (c) of Article 34 the words in all or any of the principles laid down 
in Part IV were substituted. But this substitution was held to be void by the Supreme 
Court in Minerva Mills v. Union of India, (1980) 2 SCC 591. 
12.  Right to Constitutional Remedies 
Article 32 guarantees the enforcement of Fundamental Rights. It is remedial and 
not substantive in nature. The rest of the Articles 33 to 35 relate to supplementary 
matters and do not create or guarantee any right. Therefore, we shall discuss Art. 32 
first and then rest of the Articles i.e. 33-35 briefly. 
Remedies for enforcement of Fundamental Rights 
It is a cardinal principle of jurisprudence that where there is a right there is a 
remedy (ubi jus ibi remedium) and if rights are given without there being a remedy for 
their enforcement, they are of no use. While remedies are available in the 
Constitution and under the ordinary laws, Article 32 makes it a fundamental right that 
a person whose fundamental right is violated has the right to move the Supreme 
Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of this fundamental right. It is 
really a far reaching provision in the sense that a person need not first exhaust the 
other remedies and then go to the Supreme Court. On the other hand, he can directly 
raise the matter before highest Court of the land and the Supreme Court is 
empowered to issue directions or orders or writs in the nature of habeas corpus, 
mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari, whichever may be appropriate 
for the enforcement of the right, the violation of which has been alleged. This power 
of the Supreme Court to issue directions, etc., may also be assigned to other Courts 
by Parliament without affecting the powers of the Supreme Court. 
EP-GCL-1 
36
The right to move the Supreme Court is itself a guarantee right and the 
significance of this has been assessed by Gajendragadkar, J. in the following 
words: 
“The fundamental right to move this Court can therefore be 
appropriately described as the cornerstone of the democratic 
edifice raised by the Constitution. That is why it is natural that 
this Court should, in the words of Patanjali Sastri, J., regard itself 
„as the protector and guarantor of fundamental rights‟, and 
should 
declare 
that 
“it 
cannot, 
consistently 
with 
the 
responsibility laid upon it, refuse to entertain applications seeking protection 
against infringements of such rights. In discharging the duties assigned to it, 
this Court has to play the role of „sentinel on the qui vive’ (State of Madras v. 
V.G. Row, AIR 1952 SC 196) and it must always regard it as its solemn duty to 
protect the said fundamental rights „zealously and vigilantly‟ Daryao v. State of 
U.P., AIR 1961 SC 1457). 
Where a fundamental right is also available against the private persons such  as 
the right under Articles 17, 23 and 24, the Supreme Court can always be approached 
for appropriate remedy against the violation of such rights by private individuals. 
(Peoples’ Union for Democratic Rights v. Union of India, AIR 1982 SC 1473). A 
petitioners challenge under Article 32 extends not only to the validity of a law but also 
to an executive order issued under the authority of the law. 
The right guaranteed by Article 32 shall not be suspended except as provided in 
the Constitution. Constitution does not contemplate such suspension except by way 
of President‘s order under Article 359 when a proclamation of Emergency is in force. 
Again in Article 31C the words appearing at the end of the main paragraph, 
namely and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy 
shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to 
such policy were declared to be void in Kesavananda's case. 
Supplementary provisions 
Articles 33-35 — contain certain supplementary provisions. 
Article 33 authorises Parliament to restrict or abrogate the application of 
fundamental rights in relation to members of armed forces, para-military forces, police 
forces and analogous forces. 
Article 34 is primarily concerned with granting indemnity by law in respect of acts 
done during operation of martial law. The Constitution does not have a provision 
authorizing proclamation of martial law. Article 34 says that Parliament may by law 
indemnify any person in the service of the Union or of State or any other person, for 
an act done during martial law. 
Article 35 provide that wherever parliament has by an express provision been 
empowered to make a law restricting a fundamental right Parliament alone can do so, 
(and not the state legislature). 
13. Amendability of the Fundamental Rights 
 (A) Since 1951, questions have been raised about the scope of amending 
process contained in Article 368 of the Constitution. The basic question 
 
EP-GCL-1 
37
raised was whether the Fundamental Rights are amendable. The question 
whether the word ‗Law‘ in Clause (2) of Article 13 includes amendments or 
not or whether amendment in Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Part III of 
the Constitution is permissible under the procedure laid down in Article 368 
had come before the Supreme Court in Shankari Prasad v. Union of India, 
A.I.R. 1951 S.C. 458, in 1951 where the First Amendment was challenged. 
The Court held that the power to amend the Constitution including the 
Fundamental Rights, was contained in Article 368 and that the word ‗Law‘ in 
Article 13(2) did not include an amendment to the Constitution which was 
made in exercise of constituent and not legislative power. This decision was 
approved by the majority judgement in Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan, 
A.I.R. 1965 S.C. 845. 
 
 Thus, until the case of I.C. Golak Nath v. State of Punjab, A.I.R. 1967, 
S.C. 1643, the Supreme Court had been holding that no part of our 
Constitution was unamenable and that parliament might, by passing a 
Constitution Amendment Act, in compliance with the requirements of 
Article 368, amend any provision of the Constitution, including the 
Fundamental Rights and Article 368 itself. 
 (B) But, in Golak Nath’s case, a majority overruled the previous decisions 
and held that the Fundamental Rights are outside the amendatory 
process if the amendment takes away or abridges any of the rights. The 
majority, in Golak Nath’s case, rested its conclusion on the view that 
the power to amend the Constitution was also a legislative power 
conferred by Article 245 by the Constitution, so that a Constitution 
Amendment Act was also a „law‟ within the purview of Article 13(2). 
 (C) To nullify the effect of Golak Nath’s case, Parliament passed the Constitution 
(Twenty-Fourth Amendment) Act in 1971 introducing certain changes in Article 
13 and Article 368, so as to assert the power of Parliament (denied to it in 
Golak Nath’s case) to amend the Fundamental Rights. The Constitutional 
validity of the 24th Amendment was challenged in the case of 
Kesavanand Bharti v. State of Kerala, A.I.R. 1973 S.C. 1461. The Supreme 
Court upheld the validity of 24th Constitutional Amendment holding that 
Parliament can amend any Part of the Constitution including the 
Fundamental Rights. But the Court made it clear that Parliament cannot 
alter the basic structure or framework of the Constitution. In Indira Gandhi 
v. Raj Narain, AIR 1975 S.C. 2299, the appellant challenged the decision of the 
Allahabad High Court who declared her election as invalid on ground of corrupt 
practices. In the mean time Parliament enacted the 39th Amendment 
withdrawing the control of the S.C. over election disputes involving among 
others, the Prime Minister. The S.C. upheld the challenge of 39th amendment 
and held that democracy was an essential feature forming part of the basic 
structure of the Constitution. The exclusion of Judicial review in Election 
disputes in this manner damaged the basic structure. The doctrine of ‘basic 
structure’ placed a limitation on the powers of the Parliament to introduce 
substantial alterations or to make a new Constitution. 
To neutralise the effect of this limitation, the Constitution (Forty-Second 
Amendment) Act, 1976 added to Article 368 two new clauses. By new clause (4), it 
has been provided that no amendment of the Constitution made before or after the 
EP-GCL-1 
38
Forty-Second Amendment Act shall be questioned in any Court on any ground. New 
clause (5) declares that there shall be no limitation whatever on the Constitutional 
power of parliament to amend by way of addition, variation or repeal the provisions of 
this Constitution made under Article 368. 
The scope and extent of the application of the doctrine of basic structure 
again came up for discussion before the S.C. in Minerva Mill Ltd. v. Union of 
India, (1980) 3 SCC, 625. The Supreme Court unanimously held clauses (4) and 
(5) of Article 368 and Section 55 of the 42nd Amendment Act as 
unconstitutional transgressing the limits of the amending power and damaging 
or destroying the basic structure of the Constitution. 
In Woman Rao v. Union of India, (1981) 2 SCC 362 the Supreme Court held that 
the  amendments to the Constitution  made on or after 24.4.1973 by which Ninth 
Schedule was amended from time to time by inclusion of various Acts, regulations 
therein  were open to challenge on the ground that they , or any one or more of them 
are beyond the constitutional power of  Parliament since they damage the basic or 
essential features of the Constitution or its basic structure. [See also Bhim Singh Ji v. 
Union of India (1981)1 SCC 166.]  
In L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India (1997) 3 SCC 261 the Supreme Court held 
that power of judicial review is an integral and essential feature of the Constitution 
constituting  the basic part , the jurisdiction so conferred on the High Courts and the 
Supreme Court is a part of in- violable basic structure of the Constitution.  
In I.R. Coelho v. State of T.N., (2007) 2 SCC 1, Article 31-B as introduced by the 
Constitution (First amendment) Act 1951 was held to be valid by the Supreme Court. 
The fundamental question before the   nine Judge Constitution Bench was whether 
on or after 24.4.1973 (i.e. when the basic structure of the Constitution was 
propounded) it is permissible for the Parliament under Article 31-B to immunize 
legislations from fundamental rights by inserting them into the Ninth Schedule and if 
so what is the effect on the power of judicial review of the court. The challenge was 
made to the validity of the urban land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 which was 
inserted in the Ninth Schedule.  
The Supreme Court held that all amendments to the Constitution made on or 
after 24.4.1973 by which Ninth Schedule is amended by inclusion of various laws 
therein shall have to be tested on the touch stone of the basic or essential features of 
the Constitution as reflected in Article 21 read with Article 14, Article 19 and the 
principles under lying them. So also any law included in Schedule IX do not become 
part of the Constitution. They derive their validity on account of being included in 
Schedule IX and this exercise is to be tested every time it is undertaken. If the validity 
of any Ninth Schedule law has already been upheld by this Court, it would not be 
open to challenge such law on the principles declared in this judgement. However, if 
a law held to be violative of any rights of Part III is subsequently incorporated in the 
Ninth Schedule after 24.4.1973 such a violation shall be open to challenge on the 
ground that it destroys or damages the basic structure  doctrine.   
In Glanrock  Estate (P) Ltd. v. State of Tamil Nadu (2010) 10 SCC 96, the 
Supreme Court upheld constitutional validity of Constitution (Thirty-fourth) 
Amendment Act, 1974.  By Constitution (Thirty-fourth) Amendment Act, 1974 Gudalur 
Janman Estates (Abolition & Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1969 was inserted in the 
Ninth Schedule as item 80.  
 
EP-GCL-1 
39
It was alleged that the 1969 Act violated the principle of equality because by the 
T N Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961 only ceiling surplus forest 
lands vested in the State but by the 1969 Act all forests vested in the State.  The 
constitutional amendment was further challenged on the ground that it validated the 
1969 Act by inserting it in the Ninth Schedule in spite of Section 3 of the 1969 Act 
having been declared as unconstitutional in Balmadies case, (1972) 2 SCC 133, 
thereby violating the principles of judicial review, rule of law and separation of 
powers. (Section 3 had been declared unconstitutional in Balmadies case because it 
could not be shown how vesting of forest lands was an agrarian reform.)   
Upholding the constitutional validity of the amendment, the Supreme Court held:  
None of the facets of Article 14 have been abrogated by the Constitution (Thirty-
fourth Amendment) Act, 1974, which included the 1969 Act in the Ninth Schedule.  
When the 1969 Act was put in the Ninth Schedule in1 974, the Act received immunity 
from Article 31(2) with retrospective effect.  
It is only that breach of the principle of equality which is of the character of 
destroying the basic framework of the Constitution which will not be protected by 
Article 31-B.  If every breach of Articl3 14, however egregious, is held to be 
unprotected by Article 31-B, there would be no purpose in protection by Article 31-B. 
In the present case, not even an ordinary principle of equality under Article 14, 
leave aside the egalitarian equality as an overarching principle, is violated.  Even 
assuming for the same of argument that Article 14 stood violated, even then the 1969 
Act in any event stood validated by its insertion in the Ninth Schedule vide the 
Constitution (Thirty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1974.There is no merit in the submission 
that the Constitution (Thirty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1974 by which the 1969 Act was 
inserted in the Ninth Schedule as item 80 seeks to confer naked power on Parliament 
and destroys basic features of the Constitution, namely, judicial review and 
separation of powers as well as rule of law. 
The doctrine of basic structure provides a touchstone on which validity of the 
constitutional amendment Act could be judged. Core constitutional values/ 
overarching principles like secularism; egalitarian equality etc. fall out side the 
amendatory power under Article 368 of the Constitution and Parliament cannot 
amend the constitution to abrogate these principles so as to rewrite the constitution.  
[In Glanrock  Estate (P) Ltd. v. State of T N (2010) 10 SCC 96.] 
III.  DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY 
The Sub-committee on Fundamental Rights constituted by the Constituent 
Assembly has suggested two types of Fundamental Rights — one which can be 
enforced in the Courts of law and the other which because of their different nature 
cannot be enforced in the law Courts. Later on however, the former were put under 
the head ‗Fundamental Rights‘ as Part III which we have already discussed and the 
latter were put separately in Part IV of the Constitution under the heading ‗Directive 
Principles of State Policy‘ which are discussed in the following pages. 
The Articles included in Part IV of the Constitution (Articles 36 to 51) contain 
certain Directives which are the guidelines for the future Government to lead the 
country. Article 37 provides that the ‗provisions contained in this part (i) shall not be 
enforceable by any Court, but the principles therein laid down are neverthless (ii) 
fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the state to 
EP-GCL-1 
40
apply these principles in making laws. The Directives, however, differ from the 
fundamental rights contained in Part-III of the Constitution or the ordinary laws of the 
land in the following respects : 
 
(i) The Directives are not enforceable in the courts and do not create any 
justiciable rights in favour of individuals. 
 (ii) The Directives require to be implemented by legislation and so long as there 
is no law carrying out the policy laid down in a Directive neither the state nor 
an individual can violate any existing law. 
 (iii) The Directives per-se do not confer upon or take away any legislative power 
from the appropriate legislature. 
 (iv) The courts cannot declare any law as void on the ground that it contravenes 
any of the Directive Principles. 
 (v) The courts are not competent to compel the Government to carry out any 
Directives or to make any law for that purpose. 
 (vi) Though it is the duty of the state to implement the Directives, it can do so 
only subject to the limitations imposed by the different provisions of the 
Constitution upon the exercise of the legislative and executive power by the 
state. 
Conflict between a Fundamental Right and a Directive Principle 
The declarations made in Part IV of the Constitution under the head ‗Directive 
Principles of State Policy‘ are in many cases of a wider import than the declarations 
made in Part III as ‗Fundamental Rights‘. Hence, the question of priority in case of 
conflict between the two classes of the provisions may easily arise. What will be the 
legal position if a law enacted to enforce a Directive Principle violates a Fundamental 
Right? Initialy, the Courts, adopted a strict view in this respect and ruled that a 
Directive Principle could not override a Fundamental Right, and in case of conflict 
between the two, a Fundamental Right would prevail over the Directive Principle. 
When the matter came before the Supreme Court in State of Madras v. 
Champakram Dorairajan, AIR 1951 S.C. 226, where the validity of a Government 
order alleged to be made to give effect to a Directive Principle was challenged 
as being violative of a Fundamental Right, the Supreme Court made the 
observation that : 
“The Directive Principles of State Policy have to conform to and run as 
subsidiary to the chapter of Fundamental Rights.” 
The Court ruled that while the Fundamental Rights were enforceable, the 
Directive Principles were not, and so the laws made to implement Directive 
Principles could not take away Fundamental Rights. 
The Supreme Court also pointed out that looking at Directive Principles, we 
find as was envisaged by the Constitution makers, that they lay down the 
ideals to be observed by every Government to bring about an economic 
democracy in this country. Such a democracy actually is our need and unless 
we achieve it as soon as possible, there is a danger to our political and 
constitutional democracy of being overthrown by undemocratic and 
unconstitutional means.

Important Directive Principles: To be specific, the important Directive 
Principles are enumerated below: 
 
(a) State to secure a social order for the promotion of welfare of the

EP-GCL-1 
42
 (ff) The State take steps, by suitable legislation or in any other way, to secure 
the participation of workers in the management of undertakings, 
establishments or other organisations engaged in any industry (Article 43A).

injurious to health (Article 47). 
 (k) The State must organise agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and 
scientific lines and improve the breeds and prohibit the slaughter of cows and

 (n) In international matters the State must endeavour to promote peace and 
security, maintain just and honourable relations in respect of international law 
between nations, treaty obligations and encourage settlement of international 
disputes by arbitration (Article 51). 
IV.  FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES 
Article 51A imposing the fundamental duties on every citizen of India 
was inserted by the Constitution Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976. 
The objective in introducing these duties is not laid down in the Bill 
except that since the duties of the citizens are not specified in the 
Constitution, so it was thought necessary to introduce them. 
These Fundamental Duties are: 
 (a) to abide by the constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the 
National Flag and the National Anthem; 
 (b) To cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for 
freedom; 
 (c) to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India; 
 (d) to defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so; 
 
EP-GCL-1 
43
? 
 (e) to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the 
people of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional 
diversities; to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women; 
 
(f) to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture; 
 (g) to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers 
and wild life, and to have compassion for living creatures; 
 (h) to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and 
reform; 
 
(i) to safeguard public property and to abjure violence; 
 
(j) to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity 
so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and 
achievement. 
 (k) To provide opportunities for education to one‘s child or, as the case may be, 
ward between the age of six and fourteen years. 
Since the duties are imposed upon the citizens and not upon the States, 
legislation is necessary for their implementation. Fundamental duties can‘t be 
enforced by writs (Surya Narain v. Union of India, AIR 1982 Raj 1). The Supreme 
Court in AIIMS Students’ Union v. AIIMS (2002) SCC 428 has reiterated that though 
the fundamental duties are not enforceable by the courts, they provide a valuable 
guide and aid to the interpretation of Constitutional and legal issues. 
Further, in Om Prakash v. State of U.P. (2004) 3 SCC 402, the Supreme Court 
held that fundamental duties enjoined on citizens under Article 51-A should also 
guide the legislative and executive actions of elected or non-elected institutions and 
organizations of citizens including municipal bodies.

V.  ORDINANCE MAKING POWERS 
1.  Of the President 
In its Article 53 the Constitution lays down that the ―executive power of the union 
shall be vested in the president‖. The President of India shall, thus, be the head of the 
‗executive power‘ of the union. The executive power may be defined as the power of 
―carrying on the business of Government‖ or ―the administration of the affairs of the 
state‖ excepting functions which are vested in any other authority by the Constitution. 
The various powers that are included within the comprehensive expression ‗executive 
EP-GCL-1 
44
power‘ in a modern state have been classified under various heads as follows: 
 
(i) Administrative power, i.e., the execution of the laws and the administration of 
the departments of Government. 
 (ii) Military power, i.e., the command of the armed forces and the conduct of war. 
 (iii) Legislative power, i.e., the summoning prorogation, etc. of the legislature. 
 (iv) Judicial power, i.e., granting of pardons, reprieves etc. to persons convicted 
of crime. 
These powers vest in the President under each of these heads, subject to the 
limitations made under the Constitution. 
Ordinance-making power 
The most important legislative power conferred on the President is to promulgate 
Ordinances. Article 123 of the Constitution provides that the President shall have the 
power to legislate by Ordinances at any time when it is not possible to have a 
parliamentary enactment on the subject, immediately. This is a special feature of the 
Constitution of India. 
The ambit of this Ordinance-making power of the President is co-extensive with 
the legislative powers of Parliament, that is to say it may relate to any subject in 
respect of which parliament has the right to legislate and is subject to the same 
constitutional limitations as legislation by Parliament. 
On the other hand, according to Article 13(3)(a) ―Law‖ includes an ―Ordinance‖. 
But an Ordinance shall be of temporary duration. It may be of any nature, i.e., it may 
be retrospective or may amend or repeal any law or Act of Parliament itself. 
This independent power of the executive to legislate by Ordinance has the 
following peculiarities: 
 
(i) the Ordinance-making power will be available to the President only when 
both the Houses of Parliament have been prorogued or is otherwise not in 
session, so that it is not possible to have a law enacted by Parliament. 
However, Ordinance can be made even if only one House is in Session 
because law cannot be made by that House in session alone. Both the 
Houses must be in session when Parliament makes the law. The President‘s 
Ordinance making power under the Constitution is not a co-ordinate or 
parallel power of legislation along with Legislature. 
 (ii) this power is to be exercised by the President on the advice of his Council of 
Ministers. 
 (iii) the President must be satisfied about the need for the Ordinance and he 
cannot be compelled 
 (iv) the Ordinance must be laid before Parliament when it re-assembles, and 
shall automatically cease to have effect at the expiration of 6 weeks from the 
date of re-assembly or before resolutions have been passed disapproving the 
Ordinance. 
 (v) the period of six weeks will be counted from the latter date if the Houses 
reassemble on different dates.

Judicial review of the President‘s satisfaction is not totally ruled out. 
 
(i) A.K. Roy v. Union of India, AIR 1982 SC 710. 
 (ii) Cooper v. Union of India, AIR 1970 SC 564. 
2.  Of the Governor 
The executive power of the State is vested in the Governor and all executive 
action of the State has to be taken in the name of the Governor. Normally there shall 
be a Governor for each State but the same person can be appointed as Governor for 
two or more states. The Governor of a State is not elected but is appointed by the 
President and holds his office at the pleasure of the President. The head of the 
executive power to a State is the Governor just as the President for the Union. 
Powers: The Governor possesses executive, legislation and judicial powers as 
the Presidents except that he has no diplomate or military powers like the President. 
Ordinance making power 
This power is exercised under the head of ‗legislative powers‘. The Governor‘s 
power to make Ordinances as given under Article 213 is similar to the Ordinance 
making power of the President and have the force of an Act of the State Legislature. 
He can make Ordinance only when the state Legislature or either of the two Houses 
(where it is bicameral) is not in session. He must be satisfied that circumstances exist 
which render it necessary to take immediate action. While exercising this power 
Governor must act with the aid and advise of the Council of Ministers. But in following 
cases the Governor cannot promulgate any Ordinance without instructions from the 
President: 
 (a) if a Bill containing the same provisions would under this constitution  have 
required the previous section of the President. 
 (b) he would have deemed it necessary to reserve  a Bill containing the same 
provisions for the consideration of the President. 
 (c) an Act of the state legislature containing the same provisions would under 
this constitution have been invalid under having been reserved for the 
consideration of the President, it had received the assent of the President. 
The Ordinance must be laid before the state legislature (when it re-assembles) 
and shall automatically cease to have effect at the expiration of six weeks from the 
date of the re-assembly unless disapproved earlier by that legislature.

VI.  LEGISLATIVE POWERS OF THE UNION AND THE STATES 
1.  Two Sets of Government 
The Indian Constitution is essentially federal. 
Dicey, in the ―Law of Constitution‘ has said ―Federation means the distribution of 
the force of the state among a number of co-ordinate bodies, each originating in and 
controlled by the Constitution‖. The field of Government is divided between the 
Federal and State Governments which are not subordinate to one another but are co-
ordinate and independent within the sphere allotted to them. The existence of co-
ordinate authorities independent of each other is the gist of the federal principle. 
A federal constitution establishes a dual polity as it comprises two levels of 
Government. At one level, there exists a Central Government having jurisdiction over 
the whole country and reaching down to the person and property of every individual 
therein. At the other level, there exists the State Government each of which exercises 
jurisdiction in one of the States into which the country is divided under the 
Constitution. A citizen of the federal country thus becomes subject to the  decrees of 
two Government — the central and the regional. 
The Union of India is now composed of 28 States and both the Union and the 
States derive their authority from the Constitution which divides all powers-legislative, 
executive and financial, between them. The result is that the States are not delegates 
of the Union and though there are agencies and devices for Union control over the 
States in many matters, the States are autonomous within their own spheres as 
allotted to them by the Constitution. Both the Union and States are equally subject to 
the limitations imposed by the Constitution, say, for example, the exercise of 
legislative powers being limited by Fundamental Rights. However, there are some 
parts of Indian territory which are not covered by these States and such territories are 
called Union Territories. 
The two levels of Government divide and share the totality of governmental 
functions and powers between themselves. A federal constitution thus envisages a 
division of governmental functions and powers between the centre and the regions by 
the sanction of the Constitution. 
Chapter I of Part XI (Articles 245 to 255) of the Indian Constitution read with 
Seventh Schedule thereto covers the legislative relationship between the Union and 
the States. In analysis of  these provisions reveals that the entire legislative sphere 
has been divided on the basis of: 
(a) territory with respect to which the laws are to be made, and 
(b) subject matter on which laws are to be made. 
2.  Territorial Distribution 
The Union Legislature, i.e., Parliament has the power to make laws for the whole 
of the territory of India or any part thereof, and the State Legislatures have the power 
to make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of the respective States. Thus, 
while the laws of the Union can be enforced throughout the territory of India, the laws 
of a State cannot be operative beyond the territorial limits of that States. For example, 
a law passed by the legislature of the Punjab State cannot be made applicable to the 
 
EP-GCL-1 
47
State of Uttar Pradesh or any other state. However, this simple generalisation of 
territorial division of legislative jurisdiction is subject to the following clarification. 
(A)  Parliament 
From the territorial point of view, Parliament, being supreme legislative body, 
may make laws for the whole of India; or any part thereof; and it can also make laws 
which may have their application even beyond the territory of India. A law made by 
Parliament is not invalid merely because it has an extra-territorial operation. As 
explained by Kania C.J. in A.H. Wadia v. Income-tax Commissioner, A.I.R. 1949 F.C. 
18, 25 ―In the case of sovereign Legislature, questions of extra-territoriality of any 
enactment can never be raised in the municipal courts as a ground for challenging its 
validity. The legislation may offend the rules of International law, may not be 
recognised by foreign courts, or there may be practical difficulties in enforcing them 
but these are questions of policy with which the domestic tribunals are not 
concerned‖. 
A Union Territory is administered directly by the Central Executive. Article 239(1) 
provides save as otherwise provided, by Parliament by law, every Union Territory 
shall be administered by the President acting, to such extent as he thinks fit, through 
an Administrator to be appointed by him with such designation as he may specify. 
Article 239A empowers Parliament to create local Legislatures or Council of Ministers 
or both for certain Union Territories with such constitutional powers and functions, in 
each case, as may be specified in the law. Article 246(4) provides that Parliament 
can make a law for a Union Territory with respect to any matter, even if it is one 
which is enumerated in the State List. With regard to Union Territories, there is no 
distribution of legislative powers. Parliament has thus plenary powers to legislate for 
the Union Territories with regard to any subject. These powers are, however, subject 
to some special provisions of the Constitution. 
(B)  State Legislature 
A State Legislature may make laws only for the state concerned. It can also 
make laws which may extend beyond the territory of that State. But such law can be 
valid only on the basis of ―territorial nexus‖. That is, if there is sufficient nexus or 
connection between the State and the subject matter of the law which falls beyond 
the territory of the State, the law will be valid. The sufficiency of the nexus is to be 
seen on the basis of the test laid down by our Supreme Court in State of 
Bombay v. R.M.D.C., A.I.R. 1957 S.C. 699, according to which two conditions, 
must be fulfilled: 
 
(i) the  connection must be real and not illusory; and 
 (ii) the liability sought to be imposed by that law must be pertinent to that 
connection. 
If both the conditions are fulfilled by a law simultaneously then only it is valid 
otherwise not. To illustrate, in the case cited above a newspaper in the name of 
―Sporting Star‖ was published and printed at Bangalore in Mysore (now Karnataka) 
State. It contained crossword puzzles and engaged in prize competitions. It had wide 
circulation in the State of Bombay (now Maharashtra) and most of its activities such 
as the standing invitations, the filling up of the forms and the payment of money took 
place within that State. The State of Bombay imposed a tax on the newspaper. The 
EP-GCL-1 
48
publishers challenged the validity of the law on the ground that it was invalid in so far 
it covered a subject matter falling beyond the territory of that State because the paper 
was published in another State. The Supreme Court, applying the doctrine of 
territorial nexus, held that the nexus was sufficient between the law and its subject-
matter to justify the imposition of the tax. So in this way, the state laws may also have 
a limited extra-territorial operation and it is not necessary that such law should be 
only one relating to tax-matters. 
3.  Distribution of Subject Matter of Legislation 
In distributing the subjects on which legislation can be made, different constitutions 
have adopted different pattern. For example, in the U.S.A. there is only one short list on 
the subject. Either by their express terms or by necessary implication some of them are 
exclusively assigned to the Central Government and the others concurrent on which 
Centre and the States both can make laws. The subjects not enumerated in this list, 
i.e., residuary subjects, have been left for the States. Similar pattern has been followed 
in Australia but there is one short list in which a few subjects have been exclusively 
assigned to the Centre and there is a  a longer list in which those subjects are 
enumerated on which Centre and States both can make laws. By necessary implication 
a few of these concurrent subject have  also become exclusively Central subjects. The 
unenumerated subjects fall exclusively within the State jurisdiction. A different pattern 
has been adopted in Canada where there are three lists of subjects, one consists of 
subjects exclusively belonging to the Centre, the other consists of those exclusively 
belonging to the States and the third where both can make law. Thus residuary 
subjects fall within the central jurisdiction. The Government of India Act, 1935 followed 
the Canadian pattern subject to the modification that here the lists of subjects were 
much more detailed as compared to those in the Canadian Constitution and secondly, 
the residuary subjects had been left to the discretion of the Governor-General which he 
could assign either to Centre or to the States. 
The Constitution of India, substantially follows the pattern of the Government of 
India Act, 1935 subject to the modification that the residuary subjects have been left 
for the Union as in Canada. To understand the whole scheme, the Constitution draws 
three long lists of all the conceivable legislative subjects. These lists are contained in 
the VIIth Schedule to the Constitution. List I is named as the Union List. List II as the 
State List and III as the Concurrent List. Each list contains a number of entries in 
which the subjects of legislation have been separately and distinctly mentioned. The 
number of entries in the respective lists is 97, 66 and 47. The subjects included in 
each of the lists have been drawn on certain basic considerations and not arbitrarily 
or in any haphazard manner.  
Thus, those subjects which are of national interest or importance, or which need 
national control and uniformity of policy throughout the country have been included in 
the Union List; the subjects which are of local or regional interest and on which local 
control is more expedient, have been assigned to the State List and those subjects 
which ordinarily are of local interest yet need uniformity on national level or at least 
with respect to  some parts of the country, i.e., with respect, to more than one State 
have been allotted to the Concurrent List. To illustrate, defence of India, naval, 
military and air forces; atomic energy, foreign affairs, war and peace, railways, posts 
and  telegraphs, currency, coinage and legal tender; foreign loans; Reserve Bank of 
India; trade and commerce with foreign countries; import and export across customs 
frontiers; inter-State trade and commerce, banking; industrial disputes concerning 
 
EP-GCL-1 
49
? 
Union employees; coordination and determination  of Standards in institutions for 
higher education are some of the subjects in the Union List. Public Order; police; 
prisons; local Government; public health and sanitation; trade and commerce within 
the State; markets and fairs; betting and gambling etc., are some of the subjects 
included in the State List. And coming to the Concurrent List, Criminal law; marriage 
and divorce; transfer of property; contracts; economic and social planning; 
commercial and industrial insurance; monopolies; social security and social 
insurance; legal, medical and other professions; price control, electricity; acquisition 
and requisition of property are some of the illustrative matters included in the  
Concurrent List. 
Apart from this enumeration of subjects, there are a few notable points with 
respect to these lists, e.g.: 
 
(i) The entries relating to tax have been separated from other subjects and thus 
if a subject is included in any particular List it does not mean the power to 
impose tax with respect to that also follows. Apart from that, while other 
subjects are in the first part of the List in one group, the subjects relating to 
tax are given towards the end of the List. 
 (ii) Subject-matter of tax is enumerated only in the Union List and the State List. 
There is no tax subject included in the Concurrent List. 
 (iii) In each List there is an entry of ―fees‖ with respect to any matter included in 
that List excluding court fee. This entry is the last in all the Lists except List I 
where it is last but one. 
 (iv) There is an entry each in Lists I and II relating to ―offences against laws with 
respect to any of the matters‖ included in the respective List while criminal 
law is a general subject in the Concurrent List. 
So far we have discussed the general aspect of the subject matters of legislation 
or of the items on which Legislation could be passed. The next question that arises is, 
who will legislate on which subject? Whether, it is both Centre and the States that can 
make laws on all subjects included in the three Lists or there is some division of 
power between the two to make laws on these subjects? The answer is that the 
Constitution makes clear arrangements as to how the powers shall be exercised by 
the Parliament or the State Legislatures on these subjects. That arrangement is 
mainly contained in Article 246, but in addition to that, provisions have also been 
made in Articles 247 to 254 of the Constitution. A wholesome picture of this 
arrangement is briefly given below.

4. 
Legislative Powers of the Union and the States with respect to Legislative 
Subjects 
The arrangement for the operation of legislative powers of the Centre and the 
States with respect to different subjects of legislation is as follows: 
 (a) With respect to the subject enumerated in the Union i.e., List I, the Union 
Parliament has the exclusive power to make laws. The State Legislature has 
no power to make laws on any of these subjects and it is immaterial whether 
Parliament has exercised its power by making a law or not. Moreover, this 
power of parliament to make laws on subjects included in the Union List is 
notwithstanding the power of the States to make laws either on the subjects 
included in the State List or the Concurrent List. If by any stretch of 
imagination or because of some mistake — which is not expected — the 
same subject which is included in the Union List is also covered in the  State 
List, in such a situation that subject shall be read only in List I and not in List 
II or List III. By this principle the superiority of the Union List over the other 
two has been recognised. 
 (b) With respect to the subjects enumerated in the State List, i.e., List II, the 
legislature of a State has exclusive power to make laws. Therefore 
Parliament cannot make any law on any of these subjects, whether the State 
makes or does not make any law. 
 (c) With respect to the subjects enumerated in the Concurrent List, i.e., List III, 
Parliament and the State Legislatures both have powers to make laws. Thus, 
both of them can make a law even with respect to the same subject and both 
the laws shall be valid in so far as they are not repugnant to each other. 
However, in case of repugnancy, i.e., when there is a conflict between such 
laws then the law made by Parliament shall prevail over the law made by the 
State Legislature and the latter will be valid only to the extent to which it is 
not repugnant to the former. It is almost a universal rule in all the 
Constitutions where distribution of legislative powers is provided that in the 
concurrent field the Central law prevails if it conflicts with a State law. 
However, our Constitution recognises an exception to this general or 
universal rule. The exception is that if there is already a law of Parliament on 
any subject enumerated in the Concurrent List and a state also wants to 
make a law on the same subject then a State can do so provided that law 
has been reserved for the consideration of the President of India and has 
received his assent. Such law shall prevail in that State over the law of 
Parliament if there is any conflict between the two. However, Parliament can 
get rid of such law at any time by passing a new law and can modify by 
amending or repealing the law of the State. 
 (d) With respect to all those matters which are not included in any of the three 
lists, Parliament has the exclusive power to make laws. It is called the 
residuary legislative power of Parliament. The Supreme Court has  held that 
the power to impose wealth-tax on the total wealth of a person including his 
agricultural land belongs to Parliament in its residuary jurisdiction (Union of 
India v. H.S. Dhillon, A.I.R. 1972 S.C. 1061).

5.  Power of Parliament to make Laws on State List 
We have just discussed that the State legislatures have the exclusive powers to 
make laws with respect to the subjects included in the State List and Parliament has 
no power to encroach upon them. However, our Constitution makes a few exceptions 
to this general rule by authorising Parliament to make law even on the subjects 
enumerated in the State List. Following are the exceptions which the Constitution so 
recognises: 
(a)  In the National Interest (Article 249) 
Parliament can make a law with respect to a matter enumerated in the State List 
if the Council of States declares by a resolution supporetd by two-thirds of its 
members present and voting, that it is necessary or expedient in the national interest 
that Parliament should make a law on that matter. By such declaration Parliament 
gets the authority to legislate on that matter for the whole or part of the country so 
long as the resolution of the Council of States remains in force. But such resolution 
shall remain in force for a period not exceeding one year. However, a fresh resolution 
can be passed a the end of one year to give extended lease to the law of Parliament 
and that way the law of Parliament can be continued to remain in force for any 
number of years. 
The laws passed by Parliament under the provision cease to have effect 
automatically after six months of the expiry of the resolution period. Beyond that date, 
such Parliamentary law becomes inoperative except as regards the thing done or 
omitted to be done before the expiry of that law. 
(b)  During a proclamation of emergency (Article 250) 
While a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, Article 250 of the Constitution 
of India removes restrictions on the legislative authority of the Union Legislature in 
relation to the subjects enumerated in the State List. Thus, during emergency, 
Parliament shall have power to make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of 
India with respect to all matters in the State List. These laws will cease to have effect 
on the expiration of six months after the proclamation ceases to operate. After that 
date, such union laws shall become inoperative, except in respect of things done or 
omitted to be done before the expiry of the said period. Under Article 352, if the  
President is satisfied that a grave emergency exists where-by the security of India or 
any part of the territory thereof is threatened whether by war, or external aggression 
or armed rebellion, he may by proclamation make a declaration to that effect in 
EP-GCL-1 
52
respect of the whole of India or of such part of the territory thereof as may be 
specified in the proclamation. It is not necessary that there is an actual war or  armed 
rebellion. It is enough that the President is satisfied that there is an imminent danger 
of such war or armed rebellion as the case may be. The proclamation of emergency 
shall not be issued except when the decision of the union cabinet that such 
proclamation may be issued, has been communicated to the President in writing. 
Every such proclamation shall be laid before each House of Parliament and unless it 
is approved by both the Houses by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the 
members present and voting within a period of 30 days thereof, such proclamation 
shall cease to operate. If any such proclamatioin is issued at a time when the House 
of People (Lok Sabha) has been dissolved, or the dissolution of the House of People 
takes place during the period of one month referred to above but before passing the 
resolution, and if a resolution approving the proclamation has been passed by the 
Council of State (Rajya Sabha), the proclamation shall cease to operate at the expiry 
of thirty days from the date on which the House of the People (Lok Sabha) first sits 
after it‘s reconstitution, unless before the expiration of the said period of thirty days a 
resolution approving the proclamation has also passed by the House of the People. 
A proclamation so approved shall, unless revoked, cease to operate on the 
expiration of a period of six months from the date of passing of the second resolution 
approving the proclamation. But this period of six months may be extended by a 
further period of six months, if, within the first six months, both the Houses of 
Parliament pass a resolution approving the continuance in force of such 
proclamation. Prior to the Constitution 44th Amendment Act, the position was that the 
proclamation when approved by both the Houses of Parliament would remain in the 
force for an indefinite period unless and until the President chose to revoke the 
proclamation in exercise of the power conferred by the then Article 352(2)(a). 
Article 353 provides that while a proclamation of emergency is in operation, the 
Parliament shall have the power to make laws conferring powers and imposing duties 
or authorising the conferring of powers and the imposition of duties upon the Union or 
officers and authorities of the Union as respects that matter, notwithstanding, that it is 
one which is not enumerated in the Union List. 
(c)  Breakdown of Constitutional Machinery in a State (Article 356 and 357) 
In case the Governor of a State reports to the President, or he is otherwise 
satisfied that the Government of a State cannot be carried on according to the 
provisions of the Constitution, then he (President) can make a proclamation to that 
effect. By that proclamation, he can assume to himself all or any of the functions of 
the Government of the State and all or any of the powers vested in or exercisable by 
the Governor or any body or authority in the State, and  declare that the powers of 
Legislature of that State shall vest in Parliament. Parliament can make laws with 
respect to all state matters as regards the particular state in which there is a 
breakdown of constitutional machinery and is under the President‘s rule. Further it is 
not necessary that the legislature of the concerned state should be suspended or 
dissolved before it is brought under the President‘s rule, but practically it so happens. 
It is important to note that the President cannot, however, assume to himself any of 
the powers vested in or exercisable by a High Court or to suspend, either in whole or 
in part, the operation of any provision of the Constitution relating to the High Courts. 
Under the Constitution of India, the power is really that of the Union Council of 
 
EP-GCL-1 
53
Ministers with the Prime Minister as its head. The satisfaction of the President 
contemplated by this Article is subjective in nature. The power conferred by Article 
356 upon the President is a conditional power. It is not an absolute power. The 
existence of material-which may comprise of, or include, the report(s) of the Governor 
— is a pre-condition. The satisfaction must be formed on relevant materials. Though 
the power of dissolving the Legislative Assembly can be said to be implicit in Clause 
(1) of Article 356, it must be held, having regard to the overall Constitutional scheme 
that the President shall exercise it only after the proclamation is approved by both the 
Houses of Parliament under Clause (3) and not before. Until such approval, the 
President  can only suspend the Legislative Assembly by suspending the provisions 
of the Constitution relating to the Legislative Assembly under Sub-clause (c) of 
Clause (1). The proclamation under Clause (1) can be issued only where the situation 
contemplated by the clause arises. Clause (3) of Article 356, is conceived as a 
control on the power of the President and also as a safeguard against its abuse (S.R. 
Bommai v. Union of India, AIR 1994 SC 1918). 
Clause 2 of Article 356 provides that any such proclamation may be revoked or 
varied by a subsequent proclamation. It may, however, be noted that the presidential 
proclamation is valid only for six months at a time and that also if  approved by both 
the Houses of Parliament within a period of two months from the date of 
proclamation. A fresh proclamation can be issued to extend the life of the existing 
one for a further period of six months but in no case such proclamation can remain in 
force beyond a consecutive period of three years. The Constitution (Fourty-Second) 
Amendment Act, 1976 inserted a new clause (2) in Article 357. It provides that any 
law made in exercise of the Power of the Legislature of the State by Parliament or the 
President or other Authority referred to in Sub-clause (a) of Clause (1) which 
Parliament or the President or such other Authority would not, but for the issue of a 
proclamation under Article 356 have been competent to make shall, after the 
proclamation has ceased to operate, continue in force until altered, or repealed or 
amended by a competent Legislature or other authority. This means that the laws 
made during the subsistence of the proclamation shall continue to be in force unless  
and until they are altered or repealed by the State Legislature. So an express 
negative act is required in order to put an end to the operation of the laws made in 
respect of that State by the Union. 
The action of the President  under Article 356 is a constitutional function and the 
same is subject to judicial review. The Supreme Court or High Court can  strike down 
the proclamation if it is found to be mala fide or based on wholly irrelevant or 
extraneous grounds. If the Court strikes down the proclamation, it has the power to 
restore the dismissed government to office and revive and reactivate the Legislative 
Assembly wherever it may have been dissolved or kept under suspension. (see S.R. 
Bommai's case). 
(d) On the request of two or more States (Article 252) 
Article 252 of the Constitution enumerates the power of Parliament to legislate for 
state. The exercise of such power is conditional upon an agreement between two or 
more States requesting Parliament to legislate for them on a specified subject. This 
article provides that, if two or more States are desirous that on any particular item 
included in the State List there should be a common legislation applicable to all such 
States then they can make a request to Parliament to make such law on that 
particular subject. Such request shall be made by passing a resolution in the 
EP-GCL-1 
54
legislatures of the State concerned. If request is made in that form then parliament 
can make law on that subject as regards those States. The law so made may be 
adopted by other States also, by passing resolutions in their legislatures. Once, 
however, such law has been made, the power of those State legislatures which 
originally requested or which later on adopted such law is curtailed as regards that 
matter; and only Parliament can amend, modify or repeal such a law on similar 
request being made by any State or States. If any of the consenting States makes a 
law on that subject then its law will be invalid to the extent to which it is inconsistent 
with a law of Parliament. 
To take an example, Parliament passed the Prize Competitions Act, 1955 under 
the provisions of the Constitution. 
(e) Legislation for enforcing international agreements (Article 253) 
Parliament has exclusive power with respect to foreign affairs and entering into 
treaties and agreements with foreign countries and implementing of treaties and 
agreements and conventions with foreign countries. But a treaty or agreement 
concluded with another country may require national implementation and for that 
purpose a law may be needed. To meet such difficulties, the Constitution authorises 
Parliament to make law on any subject included in any list to implement: 
 
(i) any treaty, agreement or convention with any other country or countries, or  
 (ii) any decision made at any international conference, association or other 
body. 
These five exceptions to the general scheme of distribution of legislative powers 
on the basis of exclusive Union and State Lists go to show that in our Constitution 
there is nothing which makes the States totally immune from legislative interference 
by the Centre in any matter. There remains no subject in the exclusive State 
jurisdiction which cannot be approached by the Centre in certain situations. But by 
this, one must not conclude that the distribution of legislative power in our 
Constitution is just illusory and all the powers vest in the Centre. On the other hand, 
the distribution of legislative powers is real and that is the general rule but to face the 
practical difficulties the Constitution had made a few exceptions which are to operate 
within the circumscribed sphere and  conditions. 
6.  Interpretation of the Legislative Lists 
For giving effect to the various items in the different lists the Courts have applied 
mainly the following principles : 
 (a) Plenary Powers:  The first and foremost rule is that if legislative power is 
granted with respect to a subject and there are no limitations imposed on the 
power, then it is to be given the widest scope that its words are capable of, 
without, rendering another item nugatory. In the words of Gajenderagadkar, 
C.J. 
 
 “It is an elementary cardinal rule of interpretation that the words used 
in the Constitution which confer legislative power must receive the 
most liberal construction and if they are words of wide amplitude, they 
must be interpreted so as to give effect to that amplitude. A general 
word used in an entry ... must be construed to extend to all ancillary or 
 
EP-GCL-1 
55
subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be held to be 
included in it (Jagannath Baksh Singh v. State of U.P., AIR 1962 SC 
1563). 
 
 Thus, a legislature to which a power is granted over a particular subject may 
make law on any aspect or on all aspects of it; it can make a retrospective 
law or a prospective law and it can also make law on all matters ancillary to 
that matter. For example, if power to collect taxes is granted to a legislature, 
the power not to collect taxes or the power to remit taxes shall be presumed 
to be included within the power to collect taxes. 
 (b) Harmonious Construction: Different entries in the different lists are to be 
interpreted in such a way that a conflict between them is avoided and each of 
them is given effect. It must be accepted that the Constitution does not want 
to create conflict and make any entry nugatory. Therefore, when there 
appears a conflict between two entries in the two different lists the two entries 
should be so interpreted, that each of them is given effect and, for that 
purpose the scope and meaning of one may be restricted so as to give 
meaning to the other also. 
 (c) Pith and Substance Rule: The rule of pith and substance means that where a 
law in reality and substance falls within an item on which the legislature 
which enacted that law is competent to legislate, then such law shall not 
become invalid merely because it incidentally touches a matter outside the 
competence of legislature. In a federal Constitution, as was observed by 
Gwyer C.J. ―it must inevitably happen from time to time that legislation 
though purporting to deal with a subject in one list touches also upon a 
subject in another list, and the different provisions of the enactment may be 
so closely intertwined that blind adherence to a strictly verbal interpretation 
would result in a large number of statutes being declared invalid because the 
legislature enacting them may appear to have legislated in a forbidden 
sphere‖ (Prafulla Kumar v. Bank of Khulna, AIR 1947 PC 60). Therefore, 
where such overlapping occurs, the question must be asked, what is, ―pith 
and substance‖ of the enactment in question and in which list its true nature 
and character is to be found. For this purpose the enactment as a whole with 
its object and effect must be considered. By way of illustration, acting on 
entry 6 of List II which reads ―Public Health and Sanitation‖. Rajasthan 
Legislature passed a law restricting the use of sound amplifiers. The law was 
challenged on the ground that it dealt with a matter which fell in entry 81 of 
List I which reads: ―Post and telegraphs, telephones, wireless broadcasting 
and other like forms of communication‖, and, therefore, the State Legislature 
was not competent to pass it. The Supreme Court rejected this argument on 
the ground that the object of the law was to prohibit unnecessary noise 
affecting the health of public and not to make a law on broadcasting, etc. 
Therefore, the pith and substance of the law was ―public health‖ and not 
―broadcasting‖ (G. Chawla v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1959 SC 544). 
 (d) Colourable Legislation: It is, in a way, a rule of interpretation almost opposite 
to the one discussed above. The Constitution does not allow any 
transgression of power by any legislature, either directly or indirectly. 
However, a legislature may pass a law in such a way that it gives it a colour 
of constitutionality while, in reality, that law aims at achieving something 
EP-GCL-1 
56
? 
which the legislature could not do. Such legislation is called colourable piece 
of legislation and is invalid. To take an example in Kameshwar Singh v. 
State of Bihar, A.I.R. 1952 S.C. 252, the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950 
provided that the unpaid rents by the tenants shall vest in the state and 
one half of them shall be paid back by the State to the landlord or 
zamindar as compensation for acquisition of unpaid rents. According to 
the provision in the State List under which the above law was passed, 
no property should be acquired  without payment of compensation. The 
question was whether the taking of the whole unpaid rents and then 
returning half of them back to them  who were entitled to claim, (i.e., the 
landlords) is a law which provides for compensatioin. The Supreme 
Court found that this was a colourable exercise of power of acquisition 
by the State legislature, because “the taking of the whole and returning 
a half means nothing more or less than taking of without any return and 
this is naked confiscation, no matter in whatever specious form it may 
be clothed or disguised”. 
 
 The motive of the legislature is, however, irrelevant for the application of this 
doctrine. Therefore, if a legislature is authorised to do a particular thing 
directly or indirectly, then it is totally irrelevant as to with what motives — 
good or bad — it did that. 
 
 These are just few guiding principles which the Courts have evolved, to 
resolve the disputes which may arise about the competence of law passed by 
Parliament or by any State Legislature.

VII.  FREEDOM OF TRADE, COMMERCE AND INTERCOURSE 
This heading has been given to Part XIII of the Constitution. This part originally 
consisted of seven articles — Articles 301 to 307 — of which one (Art. 306) has been 
repealed. Out of these articles it is the first, i.e., 301 which, in real sense, creates an 
overall comprehensive limitation on all legislative powers of the Union and the State 
which affect the matters covered by that Article. This Article guarantees the freedom 
of trade, commerce and intercourse and runs in the following words: 
―Subject to the other provisions of this Part, trade, commerce and intercourse 
throughout the territory of India shall be free‖. 
The opening words of this Article clearly show, and it has been so held by the 
Supreme Court, that except the provisions contained under this Part, i.e., Articles 302 
 
EP-GCL-1 
57
to 307 under no other provision of the Constitution the free flow of trade and 
commerce can be interfered with. The object of the freedom declared by this Article is 
to ensure that the economic unity of India may not be broken by internal barriers. 
The concept of trade, commerce and intercourse today is so wide that from 
ordinary sale and purchase it includes broadcasting on radios, communication on 
telephone and even to non-commercial movement from one place to another place. If 
such is the scope of trade and commerce then any law relating to any matter may 
affect the freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse, e.g., it may be said that the 
law which imposes the condition of licence for having a radio violates the freedom of 
trade and commerce, or a law which regulates the hours during which the electricity 
in a particular locality shall be available may be called as affecting the freedom of 
trade and commerce because during those hours one cannot use the radio or 
television or one cannot run this factory. If that view is taken then every law shall 
become contrary to Articles 301 and unless saved by Articles 302 to 307 shall be 
unconstitutional. To avoid such situations the Supreme Court in the very first 
case on the matter (Atiabari Tea Co. v. State of Assam, A.I.R. 1951 S.C. 232) 
declared that only those laws which “directly and immediately” restrict or 
impede the freedom of trade and commerce are covered by Article 301 and 
such laws which directly and incidentally affect the freedom guaranteed in that 
article are not within the reach of Article 301. The word ‗intercourse‘ in this article 
is of wide import. It will cover all such intercourse as might not be included in the 
words ‗trade and commerce‘. Thus, it would cover movement and dealings even of a 
non-commercial nature (Chobe v. Palnitkar, A.I.R. 1954 Hyd. 207). The word, free in 
Article 301 cannot mean an absolute freedom. Such measures as traffic regulations 
licensing of vehicles etc. are not open to challenge. 
It was further held in the next case (Automobile Transport Ltd. v. State of 
Raj., A.I.R. 1962 S.C. 1906) that regulations that facilitate the freedom of trade 
and commerce and compensatory taxes are also saved from the reach of 
Article 301. About compensatory taxes the Supreme Court has doubted the 
correctness of its own views in a later case Khyerbari Tea Co. v. State of Assam, 
A.I.R. 1964 S.C. 925.   
With respect to regulatory laws also, we may say that if they are the laws which 
facilitate the freedom of trade and commerce then they are not at all laws which 
impede the free flow of trade and commerce directly or indirectly. The freedom of 
trade and commerce guaranteed under Article 301 applies throughout the territory of 
India; it is not only to inter-state but also to intra-state trade commerce and 
intercourse. But in no way it covers the foreign trade or the trade beyond the territory 
of India. Therefore, the foreign trade is free from the restriction of Article 301.  
Trade and commerce which are protected by Article 301 are only those activities 
which are regarded as lawful trading activities and are not against policy. The 
Supreme Court held that gambling is not "trade". Similarly, prize competitions being 
of gambling in nature, cannot be regarded as trade or commerce and as such are not 
protected under Article 301 (State of Bombay v. RMDC, AIR 1957 SC 699). 
The freedom guaranteed by Article 301 is not made absolute and is to be read 
subject to the following exceptions as provided in Articles 302-305. 
EP-GCL-1 
58
(a)  Parliament to Impose Restriction in the Public Interest 
According to Article 302 Parliament may, by law, impose such restrictions on the 
freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse as may be required in the public 
interest. 
(b)  Parliament to make Preference or Discrimination 
Parliament cannot by making any law give preference to one State over the other 
or make discrimination between the States except when it is declared by that law that 
it is necessary to do so for the purpose of dealing with a situation arising from scarcity 
of goods in any part of the territory of India [Article 303 (1) and (2)]. 
(c)  Power of the State Legislature 
The Legislature of a State may by law: 
 (a) impose on goods imported from other States or the Union territories any tax 
to which similar goods manufactured or produced in that State are subject, 
so, however, as not to discriminate between goods so imported and goods so 
manufactured or produced; and 
 (b) impose such reasonable restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce or 
intercourse within the State as may be required in the public interest.  
 
 However, no bill or amendment for making a law falling in this provision can 
be introduced or moved in the Legislature of a State without the previous 
sanction of the President. [Article 304] 
 
 In Kalyani Stores v. State of Orissa, Supreme Court held that Article 304 
enables State legislature to impose taxes on goods from other States, if 
goods produced within the state are subjected to such taxes. A subsequent 
assent of President is also sufficient, as held in Karnataka v. Hansa Corpn., 
(1981) SC 463. 
(d)  Saving of Existing Laws 
The law which was already in force at the commencement of the Constitution 
shall not be affected by the provisions of Article 301 except in so far as the President 
may, by order, otherwise direct (Art 305). 
(e)  Saving of Laws providing for State Monopoly 
The laws which create State monopoly in any trade, etc. are saved from attack 
under Article 301, i.e., they are valid irrespective of the fact that they directly impede 
or restrict the freedom of trade and commerce. So, if the State creates a monopoly in 
road, transporters cannot complain that their freedom of trade and commerce has 
been affected or if the State created monopoly in banking then other bankers cannot 
complain that their freedom of trade and commerce has been restricted. 
The last provision (Article 307) in Part XIII which need not even be mentioned 
except by way of information authorises Parliament to appoint by law such authority 
as it considers appropriate for carrying out purposes of Articles 301 to 304 and to 
confer on the authority so appointed such powers and duties as it thinks necessary.

VIII.  CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO STATE MONOPOLY 
Creation of monopoly rights in favour of a person or body of persons to carry on 
any business prima facie affects the freedom of trade. But in certain circumstances it 
can be justified. 
After the Constitution (Amendment) Act, 1951, the States create a monopoly in 
favour of itself, without being called upon to justify its action in the Court as being 
reasonable. 
Sub-clause (ii) of clause (6) of Article 19 makes it clear that the freedom of 
profession, trade or business will not be understood to mean to prevent the state from 
undertaking either directly or through a corporation owned or controlled by it, any 
trade, business, industry or service, whether to the exclusion, complete or partial, 
citizens or otherwise. 
If a law is passed creating a State monopoly the Court should enquire what are 
the provisions of the said law which are basically and essentially necessary for 
creating the state monopoly. Sub-clause (ii) of clause (6) protects only the essential 
and basic provisions. If there are other provisions which are subsidiary or 
incidential to the operation of the monopoly they do not fall under Article 19(6)(ii). It 
was held by Shah, J. in R.C. Cooper v. Union of India, (1970) 1 SCC 248 
(known as Bank Nationalisation case), that the impugned law which 
prohibited the named banks from carrying the banking business was a 
necessary incident of the business assumed by the Union and hence was not 
liable to be challenged under Article 19(6)(ii) in so far as it affected the right 
of a citizen to carry on business. 
IX. THE JUDICIARY 
Courts 
The Supreme Court 
The Courts in the Indian legal system, broadly speaking, consist of (i) the Supreme 
Court, (ii) the High Courts, and (iii) the subordinate courts. The Supreme Court, which 
is the highest Court in the country (both for matters of ordinary law and for interpreting 
the Constitution) is an institution created by the Constitution. Immediately before 
independence, the Privy Council was the highest appellate authority for British India, for 
matters arising under ordinary law. But appeals from High Courts in constitutional 
matters lay to the Federal Court (created under the Government of India Act, 1935) and 
then to the Privy Council. The Supreme Court of India, in this sense, has inherited the 
jurisdiction of both the Privy Council and the Federal Court. However, the jurisdiction of 
the Supreme Court under the present Constitution is much more extensive than that of 
its two predecessors mentioned above. 
The Supreme Court, entertains appeals (in civil and criminal and other cases) 
from High Courts and certain Tribunals. It has also writ jurisdiction for enforcing 
Fundamental Rights. It can advise the President on a reference made by the 
President on questions of fact and law. It has a variety of other special jurisdictions. 
High Courts 
The High Courts that function under the Constitution were not created for the first 
time by the Constitution. Some High Courts existed before the Constitution, although 
EP-GCL-1 
60
some new High Courts have been created after 1950. The High Courts in (British) 
India were established first under the Indian High Courts Act, 1861 (an Act of the U.K. 
Parliament). The remaining High Courts were established or continued under the 
Constitution or under special Acts. High Courts for each State (or Group of States) 
have appellate, civil and criminal jurisdiction over lower Courts. High Courts have writ 
jurisdiction to enforce fundamental rights and for certain other purposes. 
Some High Courts (notably) Bombay, Calcutta and Delhi, have ordinary original 
civil jurisdiction (i.e. jurisdiction to try regular civil suits) for their respective cities. High 
Courts can also hear references made by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal under 
the Income Tax Act and other tribunals. 
It should be added, that the "writ" jurisdiction vested at present in all High Courts 
by the Constitution was (before the Constitution came into force) vested only in the 
High Courts of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras (i.e. the three Presidency towns). 
Subordinate Courts 
Finally, there are various subordinate civil and criminal courts (original and 
appellate), functioning under ordinary law. Although their nomenclature and powers 
have undergone change from time to time, the basic pattern remains the same. These 
have been created, not under the Constitution, but under laws of the competent 
legislature. Civil Courts are created mostly under the Civil Courts Act of each State. 
Criminal courts are created mainly under the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
Civil Courts 
In each district, there is a District Court presided over by the District Judge, with a 
number of Additional District Judges attached to the court. Below that Court are 
Courts of Judges (sometimes called subordinate Judges) and in, some States, 
Munsiffs. These Courts are created under State Laws. 
Criminal Courts 
Criminal courts in India primarily consist of the Magistrate and the Courts of 
Session. Magistrates themselves have been divided by the Code of Criminal 
Procedure into 'Judicial' and 'Executive' Magistrates. The latter do not try criminal 
prosecutions, and their jurisdiction is confined to certain miscellaneous cases, which 
are of importance for public tranquillity and the like. Their proceedings do not end in 
conviction or acquittal, but in certain other types of restrictive orders. In some States, 
by local amendments, Executive Magistrates have been vested with powers to try 
certain offences. 
As regards Judicial Magistrates, they are of two classes : Second Class and First 
Class. Judicial Magistrates are subject to the control of the Court of Session, which 
also is itself a Court of original jurisdiction. The powers of Magistrates of the two 
classes vary, according to their grade. The Court of Session can try all offences, and 
has power to award any sentence, prescribed by law for the offence, but a sentence 
of death requires confirmation by the High Court. 
In some big cities (including the three Presidency towns and Ahmedabad and 
Delhi), the Magistrates are called Metropolitan Magistrates. There is no gradation 
inter se. Further, in some big cities (including the three Presidency towns and 
Ahmedabad and Hyderabad), the Sessions Court is called the "City Sessions Court", 
its powers being the same as those of the Courts of Session in the districts.

Special Tribunals 
Besides these Courts, which form part of the general judicial set up, there are 
hosts of specialised tribunals dealing with direct taxes, labour, excise and customs, 
claims for accidents caused by motor vehicles, copyright and monopolies and 
restrictive trade practices. 
For the trial of cases of corruption, there are Special Judges, appointed under the 
Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1952.

Correct answer: (a) 
 
X.  WRIT JURISDICTION OF HIGH COURTS AND SUPREME COURT 
In the words of Dicey, prerogative writs are ‘the bulwark of English Liberty’. The 
expression ‗prerogative writ‘ is one of Engish common law which refers to the 
extraordinary writs granted by the sovereign, as fountain of justice on the ground of 
inadequacy of ordinary legal remedies. In course of time these writs were issued by 
the High Court as extraordinary remedies in cases where there was either no remedy 
available under the ordinary law or the remedy available was inadequate. Under the 
Constitution by virtue of Article 226, every High Court has the power to issue 
directions or orders or writs including writs in the nature of Habeas corpus, 
Mandamus, Prohibition, Quo warranto and Certiorari or any of them for the 
enforcement of fundamental rights stipulated in Part III of the Constitution or for any 
other purpose.This power is exercisable by each High Court throughout the territory 
in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction. Where an  effective remedy is available, 
the High Court should not readily entertain a petition under Article 226 of the 
constitution of India e.g. under the Companies Act, a share holder has very effective 
remedies for prevention of oppression and mismanagement. Consequently High 
Court should not entertain a petition under the said Article (Ramdas Motors Transport 
Company Limited v. T.A. Reddy, AIR 1997 SC 2189). 
The Supreme Court could be moved by appropriate proceedings for the issue of 
directions or orders or writs, as referred to under Article 226 for the enforcement of 
the rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution. Article 32 itself being a 
fundamental right, the Constitutional remedy of writ is available to anyone whose 
fundamental rights are infringed by state action. Thus we see the power of the High 
EP-GCL-1 
62
Courts to issue these writs is wider than that of the Supreme Court, Whereas: 
 (a) an application to a High Court under Article 226 will lie not only where some 
other limitation imposed by the Constitution, outside Part III, has been 
violated, but, an application under Article 32 shall not lie in any case unless 
the right infringed is ‗Fundamental Right‘ enumerated in Part III of the 
Constitution; 
 (b) while the Supreme Court can issue a writ against any person or Government 
within the territory of India, a High Court can, under Article 226, issue a writ 
against any person, Government or other authority only if such person or 
authority is physically resident or located within the territorial jurisdiction of 
the particular High Court or if the cause of action arises within such 
jurisdiction. 
As stated earlier, the Supreme Court has been assigned by the Constitution a 
special role as ―the protector and guarantor of fundamental rights‖ by Article 32 (1). 
Although the Constitution has provided for concurrent writ jurisdiction of the High 
Courts it is not necessary, that an aggrieved petitioner should first apply to the High 
Court and then to the Supreme Court (Romesh Thappar v. Madras). 
The jurisdiction of the High Court also extends to the enforcement of rights other 
than fundamental rights provided there is a public duty. The Supreme Courts 
jurisdiction to issue writs extends to all fundamental rights (Common Cause v Union 
of India, A.I.R. 1999 SC 2979). 
Types of Writs 
A brief discription  of the various types of writs is given below: 
1.  Habeas Corpus 
The writ of Habeas corpus - an effective bulwark of personal liberty – is a remedy 
available to a person who is confined without legal justification. The words ‗Habeas 
Corpus‘ literally mean ―to have the body‖. When a prima facie case for the issue of 
writ has been made then the Court issues a rule nisi upon the relevant authority to 
show cause why the writ should not be issued. This is in national order to let the 
Court know on what grounds he has been confined and to set him free if there is no 
justification for his detention. This writ has to be obeyed by the detaining authority by 
producing the person before the Court. Under Articles 32 and 226 any person can 
move for this writ to the Supreme Court and High Court respectively. The applicant 
may be the prisoner or any person acting on his behalf to safeguard his liberty for the 
issuance of the writ of Habeas Corpus as no man can be punished or deprived of his 
personal liberty except for violation of law and in the ordinary legal manner. An 
appeal to the Supreme Court of India may lie against an order granting or rejecting 
the application (Articles 132, 134 or 136). The disobedience to this writ is met with by 
punishment for contempt of Court under the Contempt of Courts Act. 
2.  Mandamus 
The word ‗Mandamus’ literally means we command. The writ of mandamus is, a 
command issued to direct any person, corporation, inferior court, or Government 
requiring him or it do a particular thing specified therein which pertains to his or its 
office and is further in the nature of a public duty. This writ is used when the inferior 
 
EP-GCL-1 
63
tribunal has declined to exercise jurisdiction while resort to certiorari and prohibition 
arises when the tribunal has wrongly exercised jurisdiction or exceeded its jurisdiction 
and are available only against judicial and quasi-judicial bodies. Mandamus can be 
issued against any public authority. It commands activity. The writ is used for 
securing judicial enforcement of public duties. In a fit case, Court can direct 
executives to carry out Directive Principles of the Constitution through this writ (State 
of Maharashtra v. MP Vashi, 1995 (4) SCALE). The applicant must have a legal right 
to the performance of a legal duty by the person against whom the writ is prayed for. 
It is not issued if the authority has a discretion. 
The Constitution of India by Articles 226 and 32 enables mandamus to be issued 
by the High Courts and the Supreme Court to all authorities. 
Mandamus does not lie against the President or the Governor of a State for the 
exercise of their duties and power (Article 361). It does not lie also against a private 
individual or body except where the state is in collusion with such private party in the 
matter of contravention of any provision of the Constitution of a statute. It is a 
discretionary remedy and the High Court may refuse if alternative remedy exists 
except in case of infringement of fundamental rights. 
3.  Prohibition 
A writ of prohibition is issued to an Inferior Court preventing the latter from 
usurping jurisdiction which is not legally vested in it. When a tribunal acts without or in 
excess of jurisdiction, or in violation of rules or law, a writ of prohibition can be asked 
for. It is generally issued before the trial of the case. 
While mandamus commands activity, prohibition commands inactivity, it is 
available only against judicial or quasi judicial authorities and is not available against 
a public officer who is not vested with judicial functions. If abuse of power is apparent 
this writ may be of right and not a matter of discretion.  
4.  Certiorari 
It is available to any person, wherever any body of persons having legal authority 
to determine questions affecting the rights of subjects and having the duty to act 
judicially in excess of their legal authority‖ (See The King v. Electricity 
Commissioners, (1924) I.K.B. 171, P. 204-5).  
The writ removes the proceedings from such body to the High Court, to quash a 
decision that goes beyond its jurisdiction. Under the Constitution of India, all High 
Courts can issue the writ of certiorari throughout their territorial jurisdiction when the 
subordinate judicial authority acts (i) without or in excess of jurisdiction or in (ii) 
contravention of the rules of natural justice or (iii) commits an error apparent on the 
face of the record. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to issue such writs arises 
under Article 32. Although the object of both the writs of prohibition and of certiorari is 
the same, prohibition is available at an earlier stage whereas certiorari is available at 
a later stage but in similar grounds i.e. Certiorari is issued after authority has 
exercised its powers.  
5.  Quo Warranto 
The writ of quo warranto enables enquiry into the legality of the claim which a 
person asserts, to an office or franchise and to oust him from such position if he is an 
EP-GCL-1 
64
? 
usurper. The holder of the office has to show to the court under what authority he 
holds the office. It is issued when: 
 
(i) the office is of public and of a substantive nature, 
 (ii) created by statute or by the Constitution itself, and 
 (iii) the respondent has asserted his claim to the office. It can be issued even 
though he has not assumed the charge of the office. 
The fundamental basis of the proceeding of Quo warranto is that the public has 
an interest to see that a lawful claimant does not usurp a public office. It is a 
discretionary remedy which the court may grant or refuse.

XI.  DELEGATED LEGISLATION 
The increasing complexity of modern administration and the need for flexibility 
capable of rapid readjustment to meet changing circumstances which cannot always 
be foreseen, in implementing our socio-economic policies pursuant to the 
establishment of a welfare state as  contemplated by our Constitution, have made it 
necessary for the legislatures to delegate its powers. Further, the Parliamentary 
procedure and discussions in getting through a legislative measure in the 
Legislatures is usually time consuming. 
The three relevant justifications for delegated legislation are: 
 
(i) the limits of the time of the legislature; 
 (ii) the limits of the amplitude of the legislature, not merely its lack of 
competence but also its sheer inability to act in many situations, where 
direction is wanted; and 
 (iii) the need of some weapon for coping with situations created by emergency. 
The delegation of the legislative power is what Hughus, Chief Justice called, 
flexibility and practicability (Currin v. Wallace 83 L. ed. 441). 
 
EP-GCL-1 
65
Classification of delegated legislation 
The American writers classify delegated legislation as contingent and 
subordinate. Further, legislation is either supreme or subordinate. The Supreme Law  
or Legislation is that which proceeds from supreme or sovereign power in the state 
and is therefore incapable of being repealed, annulled or controlled by any other 
legislative authority. Subordinate legislation is that which proceeds from any authority 
other than the sovereign power, and is, therefore, dependent for its continued 
existence and validity on some sovereign or supreme authority. 
Classification of Subordinate Legislation 
1.  Executive Legislation 
The tendency of modern legislation has been in the direction of placing in the 
body of an Act only few general rules or statements and relegating details to statutory 
rules. This system empowers the executive to make rules and orders which do not 
require express confirmation by the legislature. Thus, the rules framed by the 
Government under the various Municipal Acts fall under the category. 
2.  Judicial Legislation 
Under various statues, the High Courts are authorised to frame rules for 
regulating the procedure to be followed in courts. Such rules have been framed by 
the High Courts under the Guardians of Wards Act, Insolvency Act, Succession Act 
and Companies Act, etc. 
3.  Municipal Legislation 
Municipal authorities are entrusted with limited and sub-ordinate powers of 
establishing special laws applicable to the whole or any part of the area under their 
administration known as bye-laws. 
4.  Autonomous Legislation 
Under this head fall the regulations which autonomus bodies such as Universities 
make in respect of matters which concern themselves. 
5.  Colonial Legislation 
The laws made by colonies under the control of some other nation, which are 
subject to supreme legislation of the country under whose control they are. 
Principles applicable 
A body, to which powers of subordinate legislation are delegated, must directly 
act within the powers which are conferred on it and it cannot act beyond its powers 
except to the extent justified by the doctrine of implied powers. The doctrine of 
implied powers means where the legislature has conferred any power, it must be 
deemed to have also granted any other power without which that power cannot be 
effectively exercised. 
Subordinate legislation can not take effect unless published. Therefore, there 
must be promulgation and publication in such cases. Although there is no rule as to 
any particular kind of publication. 
Conditional legislation is defined as a statute that provides controls but specifies 
that they are to come into effect only when a given administrative authority finds the 
existence of conditions defined in the statue. In other words in sub-ordinate 
EP-GCL-1 
66
? 
legislation the delegate completes the legislation by supplying details within the limits 
prescribed by the statute and in the case of conditional legislation, the power of 
legislation is exercised by the legislature conditionally, leaving to the discretion of an 
external authority, the time and manner of carrying its legislation into effect (Hamdard 
Dawa Khana v. Union of India, AIR, 1960 SC 554). 
While delegating the powers to an outside authority the legislature must act 
within the ambit of the powers defined by the Constitution and subject to the 
limitations prescribed thereby. If an Act is contrary to the provisions of the 
Constitution, it is void. Our Constitution embodies a doctrine of judicial review of 
legislation as to its conformity with the Constitution.

State whether the following statement is “True” or “False” 
The Subordinate Legislation is defined as a statute that provides 
control but specifies that they are to come into effect only when a 
given administrative authority finds the existence of conditions 
defined in the statute. 
 
True 
 
False 
Correct answer: False 
 
In England, however, the position is different. Parliament in England may 
delegate to any extent and even all its power of law-making to an outside authority. In 
U.S.A., the Constitution embodies the doctrine of separation of powers, which 
prohibits the executive being given law making powers. On the question whether 
there is any limit beyond which delegation may not go in India, it was held in In 
re-Delhi Laws Act, 1912 AIR 1951 SC 332, that there is a limit that essential 
powers of legislation or essential legislative functions cannot be delegated. 
However, there is no specific provision in the Constitution prohibiting the 
delegation. On the question whether such doctrine is recognised in our 
Constitution, a number of principles in various judicial decisions have been 
laid down which are as follows: 
 (a) The primary duty of law-making has to be discharged by the Legislature 
itself. The Legislature cannot delegate its primary or essential 
legislative function to an outside authority in any case. 
 (b) The essential legislative function consists in laying down the „the policy 
of the law‟ and „making it a binding rule of conduct‟. The legislature, in 
other words must itself lay down the legislative policy and principles 
and must afford sufficient guidance to the rule-making authority for 
carrying out the declared policy. 
 (c) If the legislature has performed its essential function of laying down the 
policy of the law and providing guidance for carrying out the policy, 
there is no constitutional bar against delegation of subsidiary or 
ancillary powers in that behalf to an outside authority. 
 
EP-GCL-1 
67
 (d) It follows from the above that an Act delegating law-making powers to a 
person or body shall be invalid, if it lays down no principles and 
provides no standard for the guidance of the rule-making body. 
 (e) In applying this test the court could take into account the statement in 
the preamble to the act and if said statements afford a satisfactory 
basis for holding that the legislative policy or principle has been 
enunciated with sufficient accuracy and clarity, the preamble itself 
would satisfy the requirements of the relevant tests. 
 
(f) In every case, it would be necessary to consider the relevant provisions 
of the Act in relation to the delegation made and the question as to 
whether the delegation made is intra vires or not will have to be decided 
by the application of the relevant tests. 
 (g) Delegated legislation may take different forms, viz. conditional 
legislation, supplementary legislation subordinate legislation etc., but 
each form is subject to the one and same rule that delegation made 
without indicating intelligible limits of authority is constitutionally 
incompetent. 
 
LESSON ROUND-UP 
 
 
The Constitution of India came into force on January 26, 1950. The preamble to 
the Constitution sets out the aims and aspirations of the people of India. 
Constitution of India is basically federal but with certain unitary features. The 
essential features of a Federal Polity or System are – dual Government, 
distribution of powers, supremacy of the Constitution, independence of Judiciary, 
written Constitution, and a rigid procedure for the amendment of the Constitution. 
 
The fundamental rights are envisaged in Part III of the Constitution. These are: 
(i) Right to Equality; (ii) Right to Freedom; (iii) Right against Exploitation; 
(iv) Right to Freedom of Religion; (v) Cultural and Educational Rights; (vi) Right to 
Constitutional Remedies. 
 
The Directive Principles as envisaged by the Constitution makers lay down the 
ideals to be observed by every Government to bring about an economic 
democracy in this country. 
 
Article 51A imposing the fundamental duties on every citizen of India was 
inserted by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976. The objective 
in introducing these duties is not laid down in the Bill except that since the duties 
of the citizens are not specified in the Constitution, so it was thought necessary to 
introduce them. 
 
The most important legislative power conferred on the President is to promulgate 
Ordinances. The ambit of this Ordinance-making power of the President is co-
extensive with the legislative powers of the Parliament. The Governor‘s power to 
EP-GCL-1 
68
make Ordinances is similar to the Ordinance making power of the President and 
has the force of an Act of the State Legislature. 
 
The Union of India is composed of 28 States and both the Union and the States 
derive their authority from the Constitution which divides all powers-legislative, 
executive and financial, between them. Both the Union and States are equally 
subject to the limitations imposed by the Constitution. However, there are some 
parts of Indian territory which are not covered by these States and such territories 
are called Union Territories. 
 
The courts in the Indian legal system, broadly speaking, consist of (i) the 
Supreme Court, (ii) the High Courts, and (iii) the subordinate courts. The 
Supreme Court, which is the highest Court in the country is an institution created 
by the Constitution. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is vast including the 
writ jurisdiction for enforcing Fundamental Rights. 
 
The increasing complexity of modern administration and the need for flexibility 
capable of rapid readjustment to meet changing circumstances, have made it 
necessary for the legislatures to delegate its powers. 
 
While delegating the powers to an outside authority, the legislature must act 
within the ambit of the powers defined by the Constitution and subject to the 
limitations prescribed thereby.

STUDY II 
INTERPRETATION OF STATUTES 
 
 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
The complexity of modern legislation demands a clear understanding of the principles 
of construction applicable to it. The students will understand the general principles of 
interpretation as well as internal and external aids in interpretation of the statutes. 
At the end of the Study Lesson you should be able to understand: 
 
Need for and Object of Interpretation 
 
General Principles of Interpretation 
 
Internal and External Aids in Interpretation.  
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
A statute has been defined as “the will of the legislature” (Maxwell, Interpretation 
of Statutes, 11th ed. p. 1). Normally, it denotes the Act enacted by the legislature. 
A statute is thus a written “will” of the legislature expressed according to the form 
necessary to constitute it as a law of the state, and rendered authentic by certain 
prescribed forms and solemnities. (Crawford, p. 1) 
According to Bouvier‟s Law Dictionary, a statute is “a law established by the act 
of the legislative power i.e. an Act of the legislature. The written will of the legislature. 
Among the civilians, the term „statute‟ is generally applied to laws and regulations of 
every sort law which ordains, permits or prohibits anything which is designated as a 
statute, without considering from what source it arises”. 
The Constitution of India does not use the term „statute‟ but it employs the term 
“law” to describe an exercise of legislative power.  
Statutes are commonly divided into following classes: (1) codifying, when they 
codify the unwritten law on a subject; (2) declaratory, when they do not profess to 
make  any  alteration in the existing law,  but  merely  declare  or explain what it is; 
(3) remedial, when they alter the common law,  or  the judge made (non-statutory) 
law; (4) amending, when they alter the statute law; (5) consolidating, when they 
consolidate several previous statutes relating to the same subject matter, with or 
without alternations of substance; (6) enabling, when they remove a restriction or 
disability; (7) disabling or restraining, when they restrain the alienation of property; (8) 
penal, when they impose a penalty or forfeiture.

2. NEED FOR AND OBJECT OF INTERPRETATION 
The following observation of Denning L.J. in Seaford Court Estates Ltd. v. Asher, 
(1949) 2 K.B. 481 (498), on the need for statutory interpretation is instructive: “It 
is not within human powers to forsee the manifold sets of facts which may arise; 
and that; even if it were, it is not possible to provide for them in terms free from 
all ambiguity. The English language is not an instrument of mathematical 
precision. Our literature would be much the poorer if it were. This is where the 
draftsmen of Acts of Parliament have often been unfairly criticised. A judge, 
believing himself to be fettered by the supposed rule that he 
must look to the language and nothing else, laments that the 
draftsmen have not provided for this or that, or have been 
guilty of some or other ambiguity. It would certainly save the 
judge‟s trouble if Acts of Parliament were drafted with divine 
prescience and perfect clarity. In the absence of it, when a 
defect appears, a judge cannot simply fold his hands and 
blame the draftsman. He must set to work on the constructive task of finding the 
intention of Parliament, and he must do this, not only from the language of the 
statute, but also from a consideration of the social conditions which gave rise to 
it, and of the mischief which it was passed to remedy, and then he must 
supplement the written word so as to give „force and life‟ to the intention of the 
legislature. To put into other words : A judge should ask himself the question : If 
the makers of the Act had themselves come across this luck in the texture of it, 
how would they have straight ended it out? He must then do as they would have 
done. A judge must not alter the material of which it is woven, but he can and 
should iron out the creases. 
The object of interpretation has been explained in Halsbury‟s Laws of England 
3rd Ed., vol. 2, p. 381 in the following words : “The object of all interpretation of a 
„Written Document‟ is to discover the intention of the author, the written declaration of 
whose mind the document is always considered to be. Consequently, the 
construction must be as clear to the minds and apparent intention of the parties as 
possible, and as the law will permit. The function of the court is to ascertain what the 
parties meant by the words which they have used; to declare the meaning of what is 
written in the instrument, and not of what was intended to have been written; to give 
effect to the intention as expressed, the expressed meaning being, for the purpose of 
interpretation, equivalent of the intention. It is not possible to guess at the intention of 
the parties and substitute the presumed for the expressed intention. The ordinary 
rules of construction must be applied, although by doing so the real intention of the 
parties may, in some instances be defeated. Such a course tends to establish a 
greater degree of certainty in the administration of the law”. The object of 
interpretation, thus, in all cases is to see what is the intention expressed by the words 
used. The words of the statute are to be interpreted so as to ascertain the mind of the 
legislature from the natural  and  grammatical meaning of the words which it has 
used. 
According to Salmond, interpretation or construction is the process by which the 
Courts seek to ascertain the meaning of the legislature through the medium of the 
authoritative forms in which it is expressed.

3. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF INTERPRETATION 
At the outset, it must be clarified that, it is only when the intention of the 
legislature as expressed in the statute is not clear, that the Court in interpreting it will 
have any need for the rules of interpretation of statutes. It may also be pointed out 
here that since our legal system is, by and large, modelled on Common Law system, 
our rules of interpretation are also same as that of the system. It is further to be 
noted, that the so called rules of interpretation are really guidelines. 
(i) Primary Rules 
(a) The Primary Rule : Literal Construction 
According to this rule, the words, phrases and sentences of a statute 
are ordinarily to be understood in their natural, ordinary or popular 
and grammatical meaning unless such a construction leads to an 
absurdity or the content or object of the statute suggests a different 
meaning. The objectives „natural‟, „ordinary‟ and „popular‟ are used 
interchangeably.  
Interpretation should not be given which would make other provisions redundant 
(Nand Prakash Vohra v. State of H.P., AIR 2000 HP 65). 
If there is nothing to modify, alter or qualify the language which the statute 
contains, it must be construed according to the ordinary and natural meaning of the 
words. “The safer and more correct course of dealing with a question of construction 
is to take the words themselves and arrive, if possible, at their meaning without, in the 
first instance, reference to cases.” 
“Whenever you have to construe a statute or document you do not construe it 
according to the mere ordinary general meaning of the words, but according to the 
ordinary meaning of the words as applied to the subject matter with regard to which 
they are used”. (Brett M.R.) 
It is trite that construction of  a statute should be done  in a manner which would 
give effect to all its provisions [Sarbajit Rick Singh v. Union of India, (2008) 2 SCC 
417]. 
It is a corollary to the general rule of literal construction that nothing is to be 
added to or taken from a statute unless there are adequate grounds to justify the 
inference that the legislature intended something which it omitted to express. 
 
EP-GCL-2 
73
A construction which would leave without effect any part of the language of a 
statute will normally be rejected. Thus, where an Act plainly gave an appeal from one 
quarter sessions of another, it was observed that such a provision, though 
extraordinary and perhaps an oversight, could not be eliminated. 
Similarly, the main part of the section must not be construed in such a way as to 
render a proviso to the section redundant. 
Some of the other basic principles of literal construction are: 
 
(i) Every word in the law should be given meaning as no word is unnecessarily 
used. 
 (ii) One should not presume any omissions and if a word is not there in the 
Statute, it shall not be given any meaning. 
While discussing rules of literal construction the Supreme Court in State of 
H.P  v. Pawan Kumar (2005) 4 SCALE, P.1, held: 
 
— One of the basic principles of interpretation of 
statutes is to construe them according to plain, literal and 
grammatical meaning of the words. 
 
— If that is contrary to, or inconsistent with, any 
express intention or declared purpose of the Statute, or if it 
would involve any absurdity, repugnancy or inconsistency, the 
grammatical sense must then be modified, extended, abridged, so far 
as to avoid such an inconvenience, but no further.  
 
— The onus of showing that the words do not mean what they say lies 
heavily on the party who alleges it. 
He must advance something which clearly shows that the grammatical 
construction would be repugnant to the intention of the Act or lead to some 
manifest absurdity.  
(b) The Mischief Rule or Heydon‟s Rule 
In Heydon‟s Case, in 1584, it was resolved by the Barons of the Exchequer “that 
for the sure and true interpretation of all statutes in general (be they penal or 
beneficial, restrictive or enlarging of the Common Law) four things are to be 
discerned and considered: (1) What was the Common Law before the making of the 
Act; (2) What was the mischief and defect for which the Common Law did not 
provide; (3) What remedy the parliament had resolved and appointed to cure the 
disease of the Commonwealth; and (4) The true reason of the remedy. 
Although judges are unlikely to propound formally in their judgements the four 
questions in Heydon‟s Case, consideration of the “mischief” or “object” of the 
enactment is common and will often provide the solution to a problem of 
interpretation. Therefore, when the material words are capable of bearing two or 
more constructions, the most firmly established rule for construction of such words is 
the rule laid down in Heydon‟s case which has “now attained the status of a classic”. 
The rule directs that the Courts must adopt that construction which “shall suppress 
the mischief and advance the remedy”. But this does not mean that a construction 
should be adopted which ignores the plain natural meaning of the words or disregard 
EP-GCL-2 
74
the context and the collection in which they occur. (See Umed Singh v. Raj Singh, 
A.I.R. 1975 S.C. 43) 
The Supreme Court in Sodra Devi’s case, AIR 1957 S.C. 832 has expressed 
the view that the rule in Heydon‟s case is applicable only when the words in 
question are ambiguous and are reasonably capable of more than one 
meaning. 
The correct principle is that after the words have been construed in their 
context and it is found that the language is capable of bearing only one 
construction, the rule in Heydon‟s case ceases to be controlling and gives way 
to the plain meaning rule. 
(c) Rule of Reasonable Construction i.e. Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pareat 
Normally, the words used in a statute have to be construed in their ordinary 
meaning, but in many cases, judicial approach finds that the simple device of 
adopting the ordinary meaning of words, does not meet the ends as a fair and a 
reasonable construction. Exclusive reliance on the bare dictionary meaning of words‟ 
may not necessarily assist a proper construction of the statutory provision in which 
the words occur. Often enough interpreting the provision, it becomes necessary to 
have regard to the subject matter of the statute and the object which it is intended to 
achieve. 
According to this rule, the words of a statute must be construed ut res magis 
valeat quam pareat, so as to give a sensible meaning to them. A provision of law 
cannot be so interpreted as to divorce it entirely from common sense; every word or 
expression used in an Act should receive a natural and fair meaning. 
It is the duty of a Court in constructing a statute to give effect to the intention of 
the legislature. If, therefore, giving of literal meaning to a word used by the draftsman 
particularly in penal statute would defeat the object of the legislature, which is to 
suppress a mischief, the Court can depart from the dictionary meaning which will 
advance the remedy and suppress the mischief. 
It is only when the language of a statute, in its ordinary meaning 
and grammatical construction, leads to a manifest contradiction of 
the apparent purpose of the enactment, or to some inconvenience 
or absurdity, hardship of injustice, presumably not intended, a 
construction may be put upon it which modifies the meaning of the 
words and even the structure of the sentence (Tirath Singh v. 
Bachittar Singh, A.I.R. 1955 S.C. 830).  
Courts can depart from dictionary meaning of a word and give it a meaning which 
will advance the remedy and suppress the mischief provided the Court does not have 
to conjecture or surmise. A construction will be adopted in accordance with the policy 
and object of the statute (Kanwar Singh v. Delhi Administration, AIR 1965 S.C. 871). To 
make the discovered intention fit the words used in the statute, actual expression used 
in it may be modified (Newman Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. Marrables, (1931) 2 KB 297, 
Williams v. Ellis, 1880 49 L.J.M.C.). If the Court considers that the litera legis is not 
clear, it, must interpret according to the purpose, policy or spirit of the statute (ratio-
legis). It is, thus, evident that no invariable rule can be established for literal 
interpretation. 
 
EP-GCL-2

? 
In RBI v. Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Ltd. (1987) 1 SCC 424.  
the Supreme Court stated.  If a statute is looked at in the context of its enactment, 
with the glasses of the statute makers provided by such context, its scheme, the 
sections, clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear different than 
when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context.  With these 
glasses we must look at the Act as a whole and discover what each section, each 
clauses each phrase and each word is meant and designed to say as to fit into the 
scheme of the entire Act.(See also Chairman Indira Vikas Pradhikaran v. Pure 
Industrial Coke and Chemicals Ltd., AIR 2007 SC 2458). 
(d) Rule of Harmonious Construction 
A statute must be read as a whole and one provision of the Act should be 
construed with reference to other provisions in the same Act so as to make a 
consistent enactment of the whole statute. Such a construction has the merit of 
avoiding any inconsistency or repugnancy either within a section or between a 
section and other parts of the statute. It is the duty of the Courts to avoid “a head on 
clash” between two sections of the same Act and, “whenever it is possible to do so, to 
construct provisions which appear to conflict so that they harmonise” (Raj Krishna v. 
Pinod Kanungo, A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 202 at 203). 
Where in an enactment, there are two provisions which cannot be reconciled with 
each other, they should be so interpreted that, if possible, effect may be given to 
both. This is what is known as the “rule of harmonius construction”. 
The Supreme Court applied this rule in resolving a conflict between Articles 
25(2)(b) and 26(b) of the Constitution and it was held that the right of every religious 
denomination or any section thereof to manage its own affairs in matters of religion 
[Article 26(b)] is subject to a law made by a State providing for social welfare and 
reform or throwing open of Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all 
classes and sections of Hindus [Article 25(2)(b)]. See Venkataramana Devaru v. 
State of Mysore, A.I.R. 1958 S.C. 255.

State whether the following statement is “True” or “False” 
According to the Rule of Literal Construction, a statute is interpreted 
according to the general meaning of the words even if it leads to absurdity. 
Correct answer: False 
 
(e) Rule of Ejusdem Generis 
Ejusdem Generis, literally means “of the same kind or species”. The rule can be 
stated thus: 
(a) In an enumeration of different subjects in an Act, general words following 
specific words may be construed with reference to the antecedent matters, and the 
construction may be narrowed down by treating them as applying to things of the 
same kind as those previously mentioned, unless of course, there is something to 
show that a wide sense was intended; (b) If the particular words exhaust the whole 
genus, then the general words are construed as embracing a larger genus. 
In other words, the ejusdem generis rule is that, where there are general words 
EP-GCL-2 
76
following particular and specific words, the general words following particular and 
specific words must be confined to things of the same kind as those specified, unless 
there is a clear manifestation of a contrary purpose. It is merely a rule of construction 
to aid the Courts to find out the true intention of the Legislature (Jage Ram v. State of 
Haryana, A.I.R. 1971 S.C. 1033). To apply the rule the following conditions must 
exist: 
 (1) The statute contains an enumeration by specific words, 
 (2) The members of the enumeration constitute a class, 
 (3) The class is not exhausted by the enumeration, 
 (4) A general term follows the enumeration, 
 (5) There is a distinct genus which comprises more than one species, and 
 (6) There is no clearly manifested intent that the general term be given a broader 
meaning that the doctrine requires. (See Thakura Singh v. Revenue Minister, 
AIR 1965 J & K 102) 
The rule of ejusdem generis must be applied with great caution because, it 
implies a departure from the natural meaning of words, in order to give them a 
meaning or supposed intention of the legislature. The rule must be controlled by the 
fundamental rule that statutes must be construed so as to carry out the object sought 
to be accomplished. The rule requires that specific words are all of one genus, in 
which case, the general words may be presumed to be restricted to that genus. 
Whether the rule of ejusdem generis should be applied or not to a particular 
provision depends upon the purpose and object of the provision which is intended to 
be achieved. 
(ii) Other Rules of Interpretation 
(a) Expressio Unis Est Exclusio Alterius 
The rule means that express mention of one thing implies the exclusion of 
another. 
At the same time, general words in a statute must receive a general construction, 
unless there is in the statute some ground for limiting and restraining their meaning 
by reasonable construction; because many things are put into a statute ex abundanti 
cautela, and it is not to be assumed that anything not specifically included is for that 
reason alone excluded from the protection of the statute. The method of construction 
according to this maxim must be carefully watched. The failure to make the 
„expressio‟ complete may arise from accident. Similarly, the „exclusio‟ is often the 
result of inadvertence or accident because it never struck the draftsman that the thing 
supposed to be excluded requires specific mention. The maxim ought not to be 
applied when its application leads to inconsistency or injustice. 
Similarly, it cannot be applied when the language of the Statute is plain with clear 
meaning (Parbhani Transport Co-operative Society ltd v Regional Transport 
Authority, AIR 1960 SC 801) 
(b) Contemporanea Expositio Est Optima Et Fortissima in Lege 
The maxim means that the best way to give the meaning to a document or 
 
EP-GCL-2 
77
proposition of a law is to read it as it would have read when it was made. Where the 
words used in a statute have undergone alteration in meaning in course of time, the 
words will be construed to bear the same meaning as they had when the statute was 
passed on the principle expressed in the maxim. In simple words, old statutes should 
be interpreted as they would have been at the date when they were passed and prior 
usage and interpretation by those who have an interest or duty in enforcing the Act, 
and the legal profession of the time, are presumptive evidence of their meaning when 
the meaning is doubtful. 
But if the statute appears to be capable of only interpretation, the fact that a 
wrong meaning had been attached to it for many years, will be immaterial and the 
correct meaning will be given by the Courts except when title to property may be 
affected or when every day transactions have been entered into on such wrong 
interpretation. 
(c) Noscitur a Sociis 
The „Noscitur a Sociis‟  i.e. “It is known by its associates”. In other words, meaning 
of a word should be known from its accompanying or associating words. It is not a 
sound principle in interpretation of statutes, to lay emphasis on one word disjuncted 
from its preceding and succeeding words. A word in a statutory provision is to be 
read in collocation with its companion words. The pristine principle based on the 
maxim „noscitur a socitis‟ has much relevance in understanding the import of words in 
a statutory provision (K. Bhagirathi G. Shenoy v. K.P. Ballakuraya, AIR 1999 SC 
2143). 
The rule states that where two or more words which are susceptible of analogous 
meaning are coupled together, they are understood in their cognate sense. It is only 
where the intention of the legislature in associating wider words with words of 
narrower significance, is doubtful that the present rule of construction can be usefully 
applied. 
The same words bear the same meaning in the same statute. It is a matter of 
common sense that a particular word should be attributed with same meaning 
throughout a Statute. But this rule will not apply: 
 
(i) when the context excluded that principle. 
 (ii) if sufficient reason can be assigned, it is proper to construe a word in one 
part of an Act in a different sense from that which it bears in another part of 
the Act. 
 (iii) where it would cause injustice or absurdity. 
 (iv) where different circumstances are being dealt with. 
 (v) where the words are used in a different context. Many do not distinguish 
between the rule and the ejusdem generis doctrine. But there is a subtle 
distinction as pointed out in the case of State of Bombay v. Hospital Mazdoor 
Sabha, (1960) 2 SCR 866. 
(d) Strict and Liberal Construction 
In Wiberforce on Statute Law, it is said that what is meant by „strict construction‟ 
is that “Acts, are not to be regarded as including anything which is not within their 
EP-GCL-2 
78
? 
letter as well as their spirit, which is not clearly and intelligibly described in the very 
words of the statute, as well as manifestly intended”, while by „liberal construction‟ is 
meant that “everything is to be done in advancement of the remedy that can be done 
consistently with any construction of the statute”. Generally criminal laws are given 
strict interpretation and unless the accused is found guilty strictly as per the 
provisions of the law, he cannot be punished. For instance, when an Act provided for 
punishment for causing wound by cutting or stabbing and the accused caused wound 
by biting, it was not covered under that provision as cutting or stabbing implied using 
an external instrument while biting and causing wound does not involve any external 
instrument. Labour and welfare laws, on the other hand are given liberal 
interpretation as they are beneficial pieces of legislation.  Beneficial construction to 
suppress the mischief and advance the remedy is generally preferred. 
A Court invokes the rule which produces a result that satisfies its sense of justice 
in the case before it. “Although the literal rule is the one most frequently referred to in 
express terms, the Courts treat all three (viz., the literal rule, the golden rule and the 
mischief rule) as valid and refer to them as occasion demands, but do not assign any 
reasons for choosing one rather than another. Sometimes a Court discusses all the 
three approaches. Sometimes it expressly rejects the „mischief rule‟ in favour of the 
„literal rule‟. Sometimes it prefers, although never expressly, the „mischief rule‟ to the 
„literal rule‟.

Correct answer: True 
 
4. PRESUMPTIONS 
Where the meaning of the statute is clear, there is no need for presumptions. But 
if the intention of the legislature is not clear, there are number of presumptions. 
These are : 
 (a) that the words in a statute are used precisely and not loosely. 
 (b) that vested rights, i.e., rights which a person possessed at the time the 
statute was passed, are not taken away without express words, or necessary 
implication or without compensation. 
 (c) that “mens rea”, i.e., guilty mind is required for a criminal act. There is a very 
strong presumption that a statute creating a criminal offence does not intend 
to attach liability without a guilty intent. 
 
 The general rule applicable to criminal cases is “actus non facit reum nisi 
mens sit rea" (The act itself does not constitute guilt unless done with a guilty 
intent). 
 (d) that the state is not affected by a statute unless it is expressly mentioned as 
being so affected. 
 
EP-GCL-2 
79
 (e) that a statute is not intended to be consistent with the principles of 
International Law. Although the judges cannot declare a statute void as being 
repugnant to International Law, yet if two possible alternatives present 
themselves, the judges will choose that which is not at variance with it. 
 
(f) that the legislature knows the state of the law. 
 (g) that the legislature does not make any alteration in the existing law unless by 
express enactment. 
 (h) that the legislature knows the practice of the executive and the judiciary. 
 
(i) legislature confers powers necessary to carry out duties imposed by it. 
 
(j) that the legislature does not make mistake. The Court will not even alter an 
obvious one, unless it be to correct faulty language where the intention is 
clear. 
 (jj) the law compels no man to do that which is futile or fruitless. 
 (k) legal fictions may be said to be statements or suppositions which are known, 
to be untrue, but which are not allowed to be denied in order that some 
difficulty may be overcome, and substantial justice secured. It is a well settled 
rule of interpretation that in construing the scope of a legal fiction, it would be 
proper and even necessary to assume all those facts on which alone the 
fiction can operate. 
 
(l) where powers and duties are inter-connected and it is not possible to 
separate one from the other in such a way that powers may be delegated 
while duties are retained and vice versa, the delegation of powers takes with 
it the duties. 
 (m) the doctrine of natural justice is really a doctrine for the interpretation of 
statutes, under which the Court will presume that the legislature while 
granting a drastic power must intend that it should be fairly exercised. 
5. INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL AIDS IN INTERPRETATION 
In coming to a determination as to the meaning of a particular Act, it is 
permissible to consider two points, namely, (1) the external evidence derived from 
extraneous circumstances, such as, previous legislation and decided cases etc., and 
(2) the internal evidence derived from the Act itself. 
(a) Internal Aids in Interpretation 
The following may be taken into account while interpreting a statute: 
Title 
The long title of an Act is a part of the Act and is admissible as an aid to its 
construction. The long title sets out in general terms, the purpose of the Act and it 
often precedes the preamble. It must be distinguished from short title which implies 
only an abbreviation for purposes of reference, the object of which is identification 
and not description. To give an example, The Civil Procedure Code, 1908 is a long 
title and CPC 1908 is a short title. The true nature of the law is determined not by the 
name given to it but by its substance. However, the long title is a legitimate aid to the 
construction. 
While dealing with the Supreme Court Advocates (Practice in High Court) Act, 
1951 bearing a full title as “An Act to authorise Advocates of the Supreme Court to 
EP-GCL-2 
80
practice as of right in any High Court”, S.R. Das, J. observed: “One cannot but be 
impressed at once with the wording of the full title of the Act. Although there are 
observations in earlier English Cases that the title is not a part of the statute and is, 
therefore, to be excluded from consideration in construing the statutes. It is now a 
settled law that the title of a statute is an important part of the Act and may be 
referred to for the purpose of ascertaining its general scope and of throwing light on 
its construction, although it cannot override the clear meaning of an enactment. 
Preamble 
The true place of a preamble in a statute was at one time, the subject of conflicting 
decisions. In Mills v. Wilkins, (1794) 6 Mad. 62, Lord Hold said: “the preamble of a 
statute is not part thereof, but contains generally the motives or inducement 
thereof”. On the other hand, it was said that “the preamble is to be considered, 
for it is the key to open the meaning of the makers of the Act, and the mischief it 
was intended to remedy”. The modern rule lies between these two extremes and is 
that where the enacting part is explicit and unambiguous the preamble cannot be 
resorted to, to control, qualify or restrict it, but where the enacting part is ambiguous, 
the preamble can be referred to explain and elucidate it (Raj Mal v. Harnam Singh, 
(1928) 9 Lah. 260). In Powell v. Kempton Park Race Course Co., (1899) AC 143, 157, 
Lord Halsbury said: “Two propositions are quite clear — One that a preamble may 
afford useful light as to what a statute intends to reach and another that, if an 
enactment is itself clear and unambiguous, no preamble can qualify or cut down the 
enactment”. This rule has been applied to Indian statutes also by the Privy Council in 
Secretary of State v. Maharaja Bobbili, (1920) 43 Mad. 529, and by the Courts in India 
in a number of cases (See for example, Burrakur Coal Co. v. Union of India, AIR 1961 
SC 154. Referring to the cases in Re. Kerala Education Bill, AIR 1958 SC 956 and 
Bishambar Singh v. State of Orissa, AIR 1954 SC 139, the Allahabad High Court has 
held in Kashi Prasad v. State, AIR 1967 All. 173, that even though the preamble 
cannot be used to defeat the enacting clauses of a statute, it has been treated to 
be a key for the interpretation of the statute. 
Supreme Court in Kamalpura Kochunni v. State of 
Madras, AIR 1960 SC 1080, pointed out that the preamble may 
be legitimately consulted in case any ambiguity arises in the 
construction of an Act and it may be useful to fix the meaning 
of words used so as to keep the effect of the statute within its 
real scope. 
Heading and Title of a Chapter 
In different parts of an Act, there is generally found a series or class of enactments 
applicable to some special object, and such sections are in many instances, preceded 
by a heading. It is now settled that the headings or titles prefixed to sections or group of 
sections can be referred to in construing an Act of the legislature. But conflicting 
opinions have been expressed on the question as to what weight should be attached to 
the headings. A “heading”, according to one view “is to be regarded as giving the key to 
the interpretation of clauses ranged under it, unless the wording is inconsistent with 
such interpretation; and so that headings, might be treated “as preambles to the 
provisions following them”. But according to the other view, resort to the heading can 
only be taken when the enacting words are ambiguous. So Lord Goddard, C.J. 
 
EP-GCL-2 
81
expressed himself as: However, the Court is entitled to look at the headings in an Act of 
Parliament to resolve any doubt they may have as to ambiguous words, the law is clear 
that those headings cannot be used to give a different effect to clear words in the 
sections where there cannot be any doubt as to the ordinary meaning of the words”. 
Similarly, it was said by Patanjali Shastri, J.: “Nor can the title of a chapter be 
legitimately used to restrict the plain terms of an enactment”. In this regard, the Madhya 
Pradesh High Court in Suresh Kumar v. Town Improvement Trust, AIR 1975 MP 189, 
has held: “Headings or titles prefixed to sections or group of sections may be referred 
to as to construction of doubtful expressions; but the title of a chapter cannot be used to 
restrict the plain terms of an enactment”. 
The Supreme Court observed that ..... “the headings prefixed to sections or 
entries (of a Tariff Schedule) cannot control the plain words of the provision; they 
cannot also be referred to for the purpose of construing the provision when the words 
used in the provision are clear and unambiguous; nor can they be used for cutting 
down the plain meaning of the words in the provision. Only in the case of ambiguity or 
doubt the heading or the sub-heading may be referred to as an aid for construing the 
provision but even in such a case aid could not be used for cutting down the wide 
application of the clear words used in the provision” (Frick India Ltd. v. Union of India, 
AIR 1990 SC 689). 
Marginal Notes 
In England, the disposition of the Court is to disregard the marginal notes. In our 
country the Courts have entertained different views. Although opinion is not uniform, 
the weight of authority is in favour of the view that the marginal note appended to a 
section cannot be used for construing the section. 
“There seems to be no reason for giving the marginal notes in an Indian statute 
any greater authority than the marginal notes in an English Act of Parliament” (Balraj 
Kumar v. Jagatpal Singh, 26 All. 393). Patanjali Shastri, J., after referring to the 
above case with approval observed : “Marginal notes in an Indian statute, as in an 
Act of Parliament cannot be referred to for the purpose of construing the Statute” 
(C.I.T. v. Anand Bhai Umar Bhai, A.I.R. 1950 S.C. 134). At any rate, there can be no 
justification for restricting the section by the marginal note, and the marginal note 
cannot certainly control the meaning of the body of the section if the language 
employed therein is clear and unambiguous (Chandraji Rao v. Income-tax 
Commissioner, A.I.R. 1970 S.C. 158). 
The Privy Council in Balraj Kumar v. Jagatpal Singh, 
(1904) 26 All. 393, has held that the marginal notes to the 
sections are not to be referred to for the purpose of 
construction. The Supreme Court in Western India Theatres 
Ltd. v. Municipal Corporation of Poona, (1959) S.C.J. 390, has 
also held, that a marginal note cannot be invoked for 
construction where the meaning is clear. 
Marginal notes appended to the Articles of the Constitution have been held to 
constitute part of the Constitution as passed by the Constituent Assembly and 
therefore, they have been made use of in consulting the Articles, e.g. Article 286, as 
furnishing prima facie, “some clue as to the meaning and purpose of the Article”. 
EP-GCL-2 
82
When reference to marginal note is relevant?  The Supreme Court has held that 
the marginal note although may not be relevant for rendition of decisions in all types 
of cases but where the main provision is sought to be interpreted differently, 
reference to marginal note would be permissible in law. [Sarbajit Rick Singh v. Union 
of India (2008) 2 SCC 417;  See also Dewan Singh v. Rajendra Prasad (2007) 1 
Scale 32]. 
Interpretation Clauses 
It is common to find in statutes “definitions” of certain words and expressions 
used elsewhere in the body of the statute. The object of such a definition is to avoid 
the necessity of frequent repetitions in describing all the subject-matter to which the 
word or expression so defined is intended to apply. A definition section may borrow 
definitions from an earlier Act and definitions so borrowed need not be found in the 
definition section but in some provisions of the earlier Act. 
The definition of a word in the definition section may either be restrictive of its 
ordinary meaning or it may be extensive of the same. When a word is defined to 
„mean‟ such and such, the definition is prima facie restrictive and exhaustive, 
whereas where the word defined is declared to „include‟ such and such, the definition 
is prima facie extensive. Further, a definition may be in the form of „means and 
includes‟, where again the definiton is exhaustive. On the other hand, if a word is 
defined „to apply to and include‟, the definition is understood as extensive. (See 
Balkrishan v. M. Bhai AIR 1999 MP 86) 
A definition section may also be worded in the form „so deemed to include‟ which 
again is an inclusive or extensive definition and such a form is used to bring in by a 
legal fiction something within the word defined which according to ordinary meaning 
is not included within it. 
A definition may be both inclusive and exclusive i.e. it may include certain things 
and exclude others. In such a case limited exclusion of a thing may suggest that 
other categories of that thing which are not excluded fall within the inclusive 
definition. 
The definition section may itself be ambiguous and may have to be interpreted in 
the light of the other provisions of the Act and having regard to the ordinary 
connotation of the word defined. A definition is not to be read in isolation. It must be 
read in the context of the phrase which it defines, realising that the function of a 
definition is to give precision and certainty to a word or a phrase which would 
otherwise be vague and uncertain but not to contradict or supplement it altogether. 
When a word has been defined in the interpretation clause, prima facie that 
definition governs whenever that word is used in the body of the statute. 
When a word is defined to bear a number of inclusive meanings, the sense in 
which the word is used in a particular provision must be ascertained from the context 
of the scheme of the Act, the language, the provision and the object intended to be 
served thereby. 
Proviso 
“When one finds a proviso to a section the natural presumption is that, but for the 
proviso, the enacting part of the section would have included the subject-matter of 
proviso”. In the words of Lord Macmillan: “The proper function of a proviso is to 
 
EP-GCL-2 
83
? 
except and to deal with a case which would otherwise fall within the general language 
of the main enactment, and its effect is confined to the case”. 
As stated by Hidayatullah, J. : “As a general rule, a proviso is added to an 
enactment to qualify or create an exception to what is in the enactment, and 
ordinarily, a proviso is not interpreted as stating a general rule”. 
A distinction is said to exist between the provisions worded as „proviso‟, 
„exception‟ or „saving clause‟. „Exception‟ is intended to restrain the enacting clause 
to particular cases; „proviso‟ is used to remove special cases from the general 
enactment and provide for them specially; and „saving clause‟ is used to preserve 
from destruction certain rights, remedies or privileges already existing.

Illustrations or Explanation 
“Illustrations attached to sections are part of the statute and they are useful 
so far as they help to furnish same indication of the presumable intention of 
the legislature. An explanation is at times appended to a section to explain the 
meaning of words contained in the section. It becomes a part and parcel of the 
enactment. But illustrations cannot have the effect of modifying the language of the 
section and they cannot either curtail or expand the ambit of the section which alone 
forms the enactment. The meaning to be given to an „explanation‟ must depend upon 
its terms, and „no theory of its purpose can be entertained unless it is to be inferred 
from the language used” (Lalla Ballanmal v. Ahmad Shah, 1918 P.C. 249). 
An explanation, normally, should be so read as to harmonise with and clear up 
any ambiguity in the main section and should not be so construed as to widen the 
ambit of the section. It is also possible that an explanation may have been added ex 
abundanti cautela to allay groundless apprehension. 
Schedules 
The schedules form a part of the statute and must be read together with it for all 
purposes of construction. But expression in the schedule cannot control or prevail 
against the express enactment (Allen v. Flicker, 1989, 10 A and F 6.40). 
In Ramchand Textile v. Sales Tax Officer, A.I.R. 1961, All. 24, the Allahabad 
High Court has held that, if there is any appearance of inconsistency between 
the schedule and the enactment, the enactment shall prevail. If the enacting 
part and the schedule cannot be made to correspond, the latter must yield to 
the former. 
EP-GCL-2 
84
There are two principles or rules of interpretation which ought to be applied to the 
combination of an Act and its schedule. If the Act says that the schedule is to be used 
for a certain purpose and the heading of the part of the schedule in question shows 
that it is prima facie at any rate devoted to that purpose, then the Act and the 
schedule must be read as if the schedule were operating for that purpose only. If the 
language of a clause in the schedule can be satisfied without extending it beyond for 
a certain purpose, in spite of that, if the language of the schedule has in its words and 
terms that go clearly outside the purpose, the effect must be given by them and they 
must not be treated as limited by the heading of the part of the schedule or by the 
purpose mentioned in the Act for which the schedule is prima facie to be used. One 
cannot refuse to give effect to clear words simply because prima facie they seem to 
be limited by the heading of the schedule and the definition of the purpose of the 
schedule contained in the Act. 
Whether a particular requirement prescribed by a form is mandatory or directory 
may have to be decided in each case having regard to the purpose or object of the 
requirement and its interrelation with other enacting provisions of the statute; and it is 
difficult to lay down any uniform rule. Where forms prescribed under the rules 
become part of rules and, the Act confers an authority prescribed by rules to frame 
particulars of an application form, such authority may exercise the power to prescribe 
a particular form of application. 
The statement of objects and reasons as well as the „notes on clauses of the Bill 
relating to any particular legislation may be relied upon for construing any of its 
provisions where the clauses have been adopted by the Parliament without any 
change in enacting the Bill, but where there have been extensive changes during the 
passage of the Bill in Parliament, the objects and reasons of the changed provisions 
may or may not be the same as of the clauses of the original Bill and it will be unsafe 
to attach undue importance to the statement of objects and reasons or notes on 
clauses. 
The Courts have only to enquire, what has the legislature thought fit to enact? 
Regarding the reference to the statement of objects and reasons, it is a settled 
law that it can legitimately be referred to for a correct appreciation of: 
 (1) what was the law before the disputed Act was passed; 
 (2) what was the mischief or defect for which the law had not provided; 
 (3) what remedy the legislature has intended; and 
 (4) the reasons for the statute. 
(b) External Aids in Interpretation 
Apart from the intrinsic aids, such as preamble and purview of the Act, the Court 
can consider resources outside the Act, called the extrinsic aids, in interpreting and 
finding out the purposes of the Act. Where the words of an Act are clear and 
unambiguous, no resource to extrinsic matter, even if it consists of the sources of the 
codification, is permissible. But where it is not so, the Court can consider, apart from 
the intrinsic aids, such as preamble and the purview of the Act, both with the prior 
events leading up to the introduction of the Bill, out of the which the Act has emerged, 
and subsequent events from the time of its introduction until its final enactment like 
the legislation, history of the Bill, Select Committee reports. 
 
EP-GCL-2 
85
Parliamentary History 
The Supreme Court, enunciated the rule of exclusion of Parliamentary history in 
the way it is enunciated by English Courts, but on many occasions, the Court used 
this aid in resolving questions of construction. The Court has now veered to the view 
that legislative history within circumspect limits may be consulted by Courts in 
resolving ambiguities. 
It has already been noticed that the Court is entitled to take into account “such 
external or historical facts as may be necessary to understand the subject-matter of 
the statute”, or to have regard to “the surrounding circumstances” which existed at 
the time of passing of the statute. Like any other external aid, the inferences from 
historical facts and surrounding circumstances must give way to the clear language 
employed in the enactment itself. 
Reference to Reports of Committees 
The report of a Select Committee or other Committee on whose report an 
enactment is based, can be looked into “so as to see the background against which 
the legislation was enacted, the fact cannot be ignored that Parliament may, and 
often does, decide to do something different to cure the mischief. So we should not 
be unduly influenced by the Report (Letang v. Cooper (1964) 2 All. E.R. 929; see also 
Assam Railways & Trading Co. Ltd. v. I.R.C. (1935) A.C. 445). 
When Parliament has enacted a statute as recommended by the Report of a 
Committee and there is ambiguity or uncertainty in any provision of the statute, the 
Court may have regard to the report of the Committee for ascertaining the intention 
behind the provision (Davis v. Johnson (1978) 1 All. E.R. 1132. But where the words 
used are plain and clear, no intention other than what the words convey can be 
imported in order to avoid anomalies. 
Present trends in the European Economic Community Countries and the 
European Court, however, is to interpret treaties, conventions, statutes, etc. by 
reference to travaux preparatories, that is, all preparatory records such as reports 
and other historical material. 
Social, Political and Economic Developments and Scientific Invention 
Reference to other Statutes 
It has already been stated that a statute must be read as a whole as words are to 
be understood in their context. Extension of this rule of context, permits reference to 
other statutes in pari materia, i.e. statutes dealing with the same subject matter or 
forming part of the same system. Viscount Simonds conceived it to be a right and 
duty to construe every word of a statute in its context and he used the word in its 
widest sense including other statutes in pari materia. 
The meaning of the phrase „pari materia‟ has been explained in an American 
case in the following words: “Statutes are in pari materia which relate to the same 
person or thing, or to the same class of persons or things. The word par must not be 
confounded with the words simlis. It is used in opposition to it intimating not likeness 
merely, but identity. It is a phrase applicable to public statutes or general laws made 
at different times and in reference to the same subject. When the two pieces of 
legislation are of differing scopes, it cannot be said that they are in pari materia. 
It is a well accepted legislative practice to incorporate by reference, if the 
legislature so chooses, the provisions of some other Act in so far as they are relevant 
EP-GCL-2 
86
? 
for the purposes of and in furtherance of the scheme and subjects of the Act. 
Words in a later enactment cannot ordinarily be construed with reference to the 
meaning given to those or similar words in an earlier statute. But the later law is 
entitled to weight when it comes to the problem of construction. 
Generally speaking, a subsequent Act of a legislature affords no useful guide to 
the meaning of another Act which comes into existence before the later one was ever 
framed. Under special circumstances the law does, however, admit of a subsequent 
Act to be resorted to for this purpose but the conditions, under which the later Act 
may be resorted to for the interpretation of the earlier Act are strict. Both must be 
laws on the same subject and the part of the earlier Act which is sought to be 
construed must be ambiguous and capable of different meanings. 
Although a repealed statute has to be considered, as if it had never existed, this 
does not prevent the Court from looking at the repealed Act in pari materia on a 
question of construction. 
The regulations themselves cannot alter or vary the meaning of the words of a 
statute, but they may be looked at as being an interpretation placed by the 
appropriate Governent department on the words of the statute. Though the 
regulations cannot control construction of the Act, yet they may be looked at, to assist 
in the interpretation of the Act and may be referred to as working out in detail the 
provisions of the Act consistently with their terms. 
Dictionaries 
When a word is not defined in the Act itself, it is permissible to refer to 
dictionaries to find out the general sense in which that word is understood in common 
parlance. However, in selecting one out of the various meanings of the word, regard 
must always be had to the context as it is a fundamental rule that “the meaning of 
words and expressions used in an Act must take their colour from the context in 
which they appear”. Therefore, when the context makes the meaning of a word quite 
clear, it becomes unnecessary to search for and select a particular meaning out of 
the diverse meanings a word is capable of, according to lexicographers”. As stated by 
Krishna Aiyar, J. “Dictionaries are not dictators of statutory construction where the 
benignant mood of a law, and more emphatically the definition clause furnish a 
different denotation”. Further, words and expressions at times have a „technical‟ or a 
„legal meaning‟ and in that case, they are understood in that sense. Again, judicial 
decisions expounding the meaning of words in construing statutes in pari materia will 
have more weight than the meaning furnished by dictionaries. 
Use of Foreign Decisions 
Use of foreign decisions of countries following the same system of jurisprudence 
as ours and rendered on statutes in pari materia has been permitted by practice in 
Indian Courts. The assistance of such decisions is subject to the qualification that 
prime importance is always to be given to the language of the relevant Indian Statute, 
the circumstances and the setting in which it is enacted and the Indian conditions 
where it is to be applied.

LESSON ROUND-UP 
 
 
A statute normally denotes the Act enacted by the legislature. The object of 
interpretation in all cases is to see what is the intention expressed by the words 
used. The words of the statute are to be interpreted so as to ascertain the mind of 
the legislature from the natural and grammatical meaning of the words which it 
has used. 
 
The General Principles of Interpretation are Primary Rules and other Rules of 
Interpretation. 
 
The primary rules are: 
 
Literal Construction: According to this rule, the words, phrases and 
sentences of a statute are ordinarily to be understood in their natural, 
ordinary or popular and grammatical meaning unless such a construction 
leads to an absurdity or the content or object of the statute suggests a 
different meaning. 
 
The Mischief Rule or Heydon‟s Rule: The rule directs that the Courts must adopt 
that construction which “shall suppress the mischief and advance the remedy”. 
 
Rule of Reasonable Construction i.e. Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pareat: 
According to this rule, the words of a statute must be construed ut res magis 
valeat quam pareat, so as to give a sensible meaning to them. A provision of law 
cannot be so interpreted as to divorce it entirely from common sense; every word 
or expression used in an Act should receive a natural and fair meaning. 
 
Rule of Harmonious Construction: Where in an enactment, there are two 
provisions which cannot be reconciled with each other, they should be so 
interpreted that, if possible, effect may be given to both. 
 
Rule of Ejusdem Generis: The ejusdem generis rule is that, where there are 
general words following particular and specific words, the general words 
following particular and specific words must be confined to things of the 
same kind as those specified, unless there is a clear manifestation of a 
contrary purpose. 
 
Other Rules of Interpretation are: 
 
Expressio Unis Est Exclusio Alterius: The rule means that express mention 
of one thing implies the exclusion of another. 
 
Contemporanea Expositio Est Optima Et Fortissima in Lege: The maxim 
means that a contemporaneous exposition is the best and strongest in law. 
 
The „Noscitur a Sociis‟ i.e. “It is known by its associates”. In other words, 
meaning of a word should be known from its accompanying or associating 
words. 
EP-GCL-2 
88
 
Strict and Liberal Construction: What is meant by „strict construction‟ is that 
“Acts, are not to be regarded as including anything which is not within their 
letter as well as their spirit, which is not clearly and intelligibly described in 
the very words of the statute, as well as manifestly intended”, while by „liberal 
construction‟ is meant that “everything is to be done in advancement of the 
remedy that can be done consistently with any construction of the statute”. 
 
Presumptions: Where the meaning of the statute is clear, there is no need for 
presumptions. But if the intention of the legislature is not clear, there are 
number of presumptions. 
 
Internal and External Aids in Interpretation. 
 
Internal Aids in Interpretation: The following may be taken into account while 
interpreting a statute: 
 
Title; Preamble; Heading and Title of a Chapter; Marginal Notes; 
Interpretation Clauses; Proviso; Illustrations or Explanations; and Schedules. 
 
External Aids in Interpretation: Apart from the intrinsic aids, such as preamble 
and purview of the Act, the Court can consider resources outside the Act, 
called the extrinsic aids, in interpreting and finding out the purposes of the Act. 
There are: Parliamentary History; Reference to Reports of Committees; 
Reference to other Statutes; Dictionaries and Use of Foreign Decisions.

I  LAW RELATING TO SPECIFIC RELIEF 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The law relating to specific relief in India is provided in the Specific Relief Act of 
1963. The Specific Relief Act, 1963 was enacted to define and amend the law 
relating to certain kinds of specific relief. 
The expression ‗specific relief‘ means a relief in specie. It is a remedy which aims 
at the exact fulfillment of an obligation. 
2. SCOPE OF THE ACT 
The Specific Relief Act, 1963 is not exhaustive. It does not consolidate the whole 
law on the subject. As the Preamble would indicate, it is an Act ‖to define and amend 
the law relating to certain kinds of specific relief‖. It does not purport to lay down the 
law relating to specific relief in all its ramifications (AIR 1972 SC 1826) 
There are other kinds of specific remedy provided for by other enactments e.g. 
the Transfer of Property Act deals with the specific remedies available to a mortgagor 
or mortgagee; the Partnership Act deals with the specific remedies like dissolution 
and accounts as between partners. 
90 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
91
? 
Under the Specific Relief Act, 1963, remedies have been divided as specific relief 
(Sections 5-35) and preventive relief (Sections 36-42). These are : 
 
(i) Recovering possession of property (Sections 5-8); 
 
(ii) Specific performance of contracts (Sections 9-25); 
 
(iii) Rectification of Instruments (Section 26); 
 
(iv) Rescission of contracts (Sections 27-30); 
 
(v) Cancellation of Instruments (Section 31-33); 
 
(vi) Declaratory decrees (Sections 34-35); and 
 (vii) Injunctions (Sections 36-42). 
3. WHO MAY SUE FOR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE 
Section 15 lays down that specific performance of a contract may be obtained by 
(a) any party thereto; (b) the representative in interest or the principal, of any party 
thereto; provided that where the learning, skill, insolvency or any personal quality of 
such party is a material ingredient in the contract, or where the contract provides that 
his interest shall not be assigned, his representative in interest or his principal shall 
not be entitled to specific performance of the contract, unless such party has already 
performed his part of the contract, or the performance thereof by his representative in 
interest, or his principal, has been accepted by the other party; (c) where the contract 
is a settlement on marriage, or a compromise of doubtful rights between members of 
the same family, any person beneficially entitled thereunder; (d) where the contract 
has been entered into by tenant-for-life in due exercise of a power the remainder 
man; (e) a reversioner in possession, where the agreement is a convenant entered 
into with his predecessor in title and the reversioner is entitled to the benefit of such 
convenant; (f) a reversioner in remainder, where the agreement is such a covenant, 
and the reversioner is entitled to the benefit thereof and will sustain material injury by 
reason of its breach; (g) when a company has entered into a contract and 
subsequently becomes amalgamated with another company the new company which 
arises out of the amalgamation; (h) when the promoters of a company have, before 
its incorporation, entered into a contract for the purpose of the company and such a 
contract is warranted by the terms of the incorporation of the company provided that 
the company has accepted the contract and has communicated such acceptance to 
the other party to the contract. 
Generally, only a party to the contract can get its specific performance. The 
section gives the list of persons who can sue for specific performance of a contract. 
The general principle is that in a suit for specific performance of a contract, all the 
parties to the contract should be parties to the suit and no one else.

Contracts which can be specifically enforced 
Section 10 provides the cases in which specific performance of contract is 
enforceable. It says that except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, the specific 
performance of any contract may, in the discretion of the Court, be enforced (a) when 
there exists no standard for ascertaining the actual damage caused by the non-
performance of the act agreed to be done, or (b) when the act agreed to be done is 
such that compensation in money for its non-performance would not afford adequate 
relief. The explanation provides that unless and until the contrary is proved, the Court 
shall presume: 
(i) that the breach of a contract to transfer immovable property cannot be 
adequately relieved by compensation in money, and (ii) that the breach of a contract 
to transfer movable property can be so relieved except in the two cases: (a) where 
the property is not an ordinary article of commerce or is of special value or interest to 
the plaintiff, or consists of goods which are not easily obtainable in the market, and 
(b) where the property is held by the defendant as the agent or trustee of the plaintiff. 
So, under this Section, contracts for sale of patent right, copy right, shares of a 
company which are not easily available, future property, chattels of special value, 
etc., are specifically enforceable. In an agreement for sale of agricultural land, the 
respondent vendor wilfully avoided the execution of sale deed after receiving full sale 
consideration. Rajasthan High Court held that compensation by way of damages 
would not be substituted to execution of sale deed. The Court directed the 
respondents to enforce the specific performance of the agreement (Ram Karan and 
others v. Govind Lal and other, AIR 1999 Raj. 167). In a suit for specific performance 
of contract of sale of a house, a stranger to the contract cannot seek to be impleaded. 
That will change the very nature of the suit. 
To succeed in a suit for specific performance, the plaintiff has to prove: (a) that a 
valid agreement of sale was entered into by the defendant in his favour and the terms 
thereof; (b) that the defendant committed breach of the contract; and (c) that he was 
always ready and willing to perform his part of the obligations in terms of the contract 
Mankaur v. Hartar Singh (2010) 10 SCC 512. 
Cases in which specific performance of contracts connected with trusts enforceable 
Section 11 lays down that except as otherwise provided in this Act, specific 
performance of a contract may, in the discretion of the Court, be enforced when the 
act agreed to be done is in the performance wholly or partly of a trust. But if a trustee 
enters into a contract in excess of his powers then such a contract cannot be 
specifically enforced.

Specific performance of part of a contract 
Section 12 deals with specific performance of a part of a contract. Sub-section (1) 
lays down the general principle that except as otherwise hereinafter provided in this 
section, the Court shall not direct the specific performance of a part of a contract. 
Sub-sections (2)-(4) lay down the exceptions to this general rule as follows: 
(i) Sub-section 2 says that where a party to a contract is unable to perform the 
whole of his part of it, but the part which must be left unperformed bears only a small 
proportion to the whole in value and admits of compensation in money, the Court 
may, at the suit of the either party, direct the specific performance of so much of the 
contract as can be performed and award compensation in money for the deficiency. 
A contracts to sell B a piece of land consisting of 100 bighas. It turns out that 98 
bighas of the land belongs to A and the two remaining bighas to a stranger, who 
refuses to part with them. The two bighas are not necessary for the use of enjoyment 
of the 98 bighas, nor so important for such use or enjoyment that the loss of them 
may not be made in goods or in money. A may be directed at the suit of B to convey 
to B the 98 bighas and to make compensation to him. For not conveying the two 
remaining bighas; B may be directed at the suit of A, to pay to A, on receiving the 
conveyance and possession of the land, the stipulated purchase money less the sum 
awarded as compensation for the deficiency. 
(ii) Sub-section 3 lays down that where a party to a contract is unable to perform 
the whole of his part of it, and the part which must be left unperformed either (a) 
forms a considerable part of the whole, though admitting of compensation in money; 
or (b) does not admit of compensation in money; he is not entitled to obtain a decree 
for specific performance; but the Court may, at the suit of the other party, direct the 
party in default to perform specifically so much of his part of the contract as he can 
perform, if the party (i) in a case falling under clause (a), pays or has paid the agreed 
consideration for the whole of the contract reduced by the consideration for the part 
which must be left unperformed and in a case falling under clause (b), pays or has 
paid the consideration for the whole of the contract without any abatement, and (ii) in 
either case, relinquishes all claims to the performance of the remaining part of the 
contract and all rights to compensation, either for the deficiency or for the loss or 
damage sustained by him through the default of the defendant. 
For example, A contracts to sell B a piece of land consisting of 100 bighas for  
Rs. 1,00,000. It turns out that only 50 bighas of land belong to A. 50 bighas are 
substantial part of the contract. A cannot demand specific performance of the 
contract but B can demand specific performance to get 50 bighas of land from A by 
paying the full consideration i.e. Rs. 1,00,000. 
(iii) Sub-section 4 lays down that when a part of a contract which taken by itself, 
can and ought to be specifically performed, stands on a separate and independent 
footing from another part of the same contract which cannot or ought not to be 
specifically performed, the Court may direct specific performance of the former part. 
For the purposes of this section, a party to the contract shall be deemed to be unable 
EP-GCL-3 
94
? 
to perform the whole of his part of it, if a portion of its subject matter existing at the 
date of the contract has ceased to exist at the time of its performance. 
Section 13 lays down the rights of a purchaser or lessee against the seller or 
lessor with no title or imperfect title. It lays down that where a person contracts to sell 
or let certain immovable property having no title or only an imperfect title, the 
purchaser or lessee (subject to the other provisions of this Chapter) has the following 
rights, namely: (a) if the vendor or lessor has, subsequent to the contract, acquired 
any interest in the property, the purchaser or lessee may compel him to make good 
the contract out of such interest; (b) where the concurrence of other persons is 
necessary for validating the title, and they are bound to convey at the request of the 
vendor or lessor, the purchaser or lessee may compel him to procure such 
concurrence and when conveyance by other person is necessary to validate the title 
and they are bound to convey at the request of the vendor or lessor, the purchaser or 
lessee may compel him to procure such conveyance; (c) where the vendor professes 
to sell unencumbered property but the property is, mortgaged for an amount not 
exceeding the purchase money and the vendor has in fact only a right to redeem it, 
the purchaser may compel him to redeem the mortgage and to obtain a valid 
discharge, and, where necessary, also a conveyance from the mortgagee; (d) where 
the vendor or lessor sues for specific performance of the contract and the suit is 
dismissed on the ground of his want of title, or imperfect title, the defendant has a 
right to a return of his deposit, interest and costs on the interest, if any, of the vendor 
or lessor in the property which is the subject matter of the contract. Sub-section (2) of 
Section 13 lays down that the aforesaid provisions of the sections shall also supply, 
as far as may be to contracts for or hire of movable property.

Correct answer: (a), (b), and (d) 
 
Contracts which cannot be specifically enforced 
Section 14 lays down the contracts which cannot be specifically enforced. They 
are (a) A contract for the non-performance of which compensation in money is an 
adequate relief; (b) A contract which runs into such minute and numerous details that 
the Court cannot enforce specific performance of its material terms or which is 
dependant upon the personal qualification or volition of the parties or a contract from 
its nature is such that the Court cannot enforce specific performance; (c) A contract 
which is in its nature determinable; (d) A contract, the performance of which involves 
the performance of a continuous duty which the court cannot supervise. Sub-section 
(2) lays down that save as provided by the Arbitration Act, 1943, no contract to refer 
present or future difference to arbitration shall be specifically enforced; but if any 
person who has made such a contract (other than an arbitration agreement to which 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
95
the provisions for the said Act apply) and has refused to perform it, sues in respect of 
any subject which he has contracted to refer, the existence of such a contract shall 
bar the suit. 
Sub-section (3) lays down that notwithstanding anything contained in clause (a) or 
clause (c) or clause (d) of Sub-section (1), the Court may enforce specific performance 
in the following cases: (a) where the suit is for the enforcement of a contract—(i) to 
execute a mortage or furnish any other security for securing the repayment of any loan 
which the borrower is not willing to repay at once; provided that where only a part of the 
loan has been advanced the vendor is willing to advance the remaining part of the loan 
in terms of the contract; or (ii) to take up and pay for any debentures of a company; (b) 
where the suit is for (i) the execution of a formal deed of partnership, the parties having 
commenced to carry on the business, or  (ii) the purchase of a share of a partner of a 
firm (c) where the suit is for the enforcement of a contract for the construction of any 
building or the execution of any other work on land provided that the following 
conditions are fulfilled, namely, (i) the building or other work is described in the contract 
in terms sufficiently precise to enable the Court to determine the exact nature of the 
building or work; (ii) the plaintiff has a substantial interest in the performance of the 
contract and the interest is of such a nature that compensation in money for non-
performance of the contract is not an adequate relief; and (iii) the defendant has, in 
pursuance of the contract, obtained possession of the land on which the building is to 
be constructed or other work is to be executed.

A contracts to sell and B contracts to buy, one lakh of rupees in the four per cent 
Central Government loan; the contract may be specifically performed. 
A contracts to render personal service to B or A contracts to marry B or A 
contracts to employ B on personal service or A, an author, contracts with B, a 
publisher to complete a literary work. B cannot enforce specific performance of these 
contracts. Not only contract of personal service, but any contract requiring personal 
skill, knowledge or volition of the parties, for example, to marry, to paint a picture, to 
complete a literary work or to sing or act at a theatre will not be specifically enforced 
as such contracts would require a constant and general superintendence as cannot 
be conveniently undertaken by a Court of Justice. 
A and B contract to become partners, the contract is not specifying the duration 
of the proposed partnership. In such a case the contract cannot be specifically 
enforced since, either A and B might at once dissolve the partnership (Scott v. 
Rayment (1868) L.R. 7 Eq. 112). 
The Court will not decree specific performance of an agreement if it be of such a 
nature that better justice will be done by leaving the parties to their remedy in damages 
(Wilson v. Northampton & Banbury Junction Rly. Co. (1874) 9 C.H. App. 279).  
The very foundation of specific performance of a contract is 
that an award for damages does not afford the aggrieved party 
a complete remedy. If in the opinion of the Court damages will 
be an adequate remedy, specific performance of the contract 
cannot be decreed (Ramji Patel v. Rao Kishore, (1929) P.C. 190).  
EP-GCL-3 
96
In such a case pecuniary compensation is equated with the specific performance 
of the contract. It can be decreed only when the remedy at law is not adequate or is 
defective. The court may come to the conclusion that the ends of justice will be 
served better by awarding the damages instead of the specific performance of the 
contract. 
A Contract may be specifically enforced: 
 
(a) If it is one for non-performance of which the mere payment of money would 
not be an adequate relief; and 
 
(b) the contract is otherwise, proper to be specifically enforced. Section 14(1)(b) 
provides three reasons for refusing specific performance: 
 
(i) When a contract runs into minute or numerous details; or 
 
(ii) When a contract is dependent upon the personal qualification or volition 
of the parties; or 
 
(iii) When the contract by nature is such that the Court cannot enforce, 
specific performance of its material terms. 
In the same way, contracts of personal service cannot be specifically enforced. 
These contracts are based upon the personal relations of the parties. They require 
mutual trust and confidence of the parties. When the contract is for personal service, 
it requires some skill or talent or of some intellectual pursuit, and in that case a 
decree for its specific performance cannot be passed by the court, as it will never 
know if the decree has been truthfully and fully executed. The Court will refuse 
specific performance of a contract if it is of such a nature that the Court cannot 
enforce its specific performance. 
Under Section 14(1)(c) contracts which are in their nature determinable cannot 
be specifically enforced. 
The Court will not enforce a contract which is in its nature determinable by the 
defendant. Determinable contract is such a contract where one of the parties can put 
an end to it. So even if a decree is passed, the defendant by putting an end to the 
contract, will evade the decree. A and B contract to become partners in a certain 
business, the contract not specifying the duration of the proposed partnership can not 
be specifically performed, for if it were so performed, either A or B might at once 
dissolve the partnership. 
4. RECOVERY OF POSSESSION OF MOVABLE AND IMMOVABLE PROPERTY 
Sections 5 to 8 deal with recovery of possession of property. Property 
may either be (i) immovable, or (ii) movable. Sections 5 and 6 deal with 
recovery of possession of immovable property while Sections 7 and 8 
deal with movable property. 
Recovery of possession of specific immovable property 
According to Section 5, a person, entitled to the possession of specific 
immovable property may recover the same in the manner provided by the Code of 
Civil Procedure, 1908. The word ‗person‘ includes any company or association or 
body of individuals, whether incorporated or not. The action under Section 5 arises 
when claim is made on the basis of ―title‖. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
97
Recovery of possession of dispossessed immovable property 
The Act provides another relief under Section 6 for the recovery of possession of 
immovable property where the claim is based merely on ‗possession‘. Section 6 
provides that if any person is dispossessed without his consent, of immovable 
property otherwise than in due course of Law, he or any person claiming through him 
may by suit recover possession thereof, notwithstanding any other title that may be 
set up in such suit. There are two restrictions; no suit under Section 6 shall be 
brought (i) after the expiry of 6 months from the date of dispossession, or (ii) against 
the Government. Under Sub-section (3) no appeal or review is allowed of any order 
of decree passed under this Section. Sub-section (4) allows a person to file a suit to 
establish his title to such property and recover possession thereof. 
The object of these provisions is to discourage people from taking the law into 
their own hands. The Sections provide a speedy and summary remedy through a 
medium of Civil Court for restoration of possession to the dispossessed. Section 5 
thus provides for a suit for ejectment on the basis of title and Section 6 gives a 
remedy without establishing title provided the suit is brought within 6 months of the 
date of possession. The object of Section 6 is to discourage forcible dispossession 
and to enable the person dispossessed to recover possession by merely providing 
previous possession and wrongful dispossession without proving title (Lachman v. 
Shambu Narain, ILR (1911) 33 ALL 174). A suit under Section 6 is maintainable 
between landlords and tenants. Heirs are also entitled to sue for recovery of 
possession. 
Recovery of specific movable property 
A person is entitled to recover the possession of specific movable property in the 
manner provided by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. (Section 7) 
Explanation 1: A trustee may sue for possession of movable property of which he 
is a trustee. The term ‗trustee‘ includes every person holding property in trust. 
Explanation 2: A special or temporary right to the present possession of movable 
property is sufficient to support a suit under this section.

(a) A bequeaths land to B for his life, with remainder to C. A dies, B enters on 
the land, but C, without B‘s consent, obtains possession of the title deeds, B

(b) A pledges certain jewels to B to secure a loan. B disposes of them before he 
is entitled to do so. A, without having paid or tendered the amount of the 
loan, sues B for possession of the jewels. The suit should be dismissed, as 
A is not entitled to their possession, whatever right he may have to secure 
their safe custody (See Donald v. Suckling (1866) L.R. 1 Q.B. 585). 
 
(c) A receives a letter addressed to him by B. B gets back the letter without A‘s 
consent. A has such a property therein as entitles him to recover it from B 
(Oliver v. Oliver (1861) 11 C.B.N.S. 139).

(d) A deposits books and papers for safe custody with B. B losses them and C 
finds them, but refuses to deliver them to B when demanded. B may recover 
them from C, subject to C‘s right, if any, under Section 168 of the Indian 
Contract Act, 1872. 
 
(e) A, a warehouse-keeper, is charged with the delivery of certain goods to Z, 
which B takes out of A‘s possession. A may sue B for the goods. 
An action in detinue would lie only for some specific article of movable property 
capable of being recovered in specie and of being seized and delivered up to the 
winning party. Section 7 lays down that a person entitled to the possession of specific 
movable propety may recover the same in the manner prescribed by the Civil 
Procedure Code. A trustee or a person having a special or a temporary right to the 
present possession may also file a suit under this section.

Which of the following Sections deal with the recovery of possession of movable 
property? 
 
(a) Sections 1 and 2 
 
(b) Sections 3 and 4 
 
(c) Sections 7 and 8 
 
(d) Sections 9 and 10 
Correct answer: (c) 
 
Liability of person in possession, not as owner to deliver to persons entitled to 
immediate possession 
Section 8 lays down that any person having the possession or control of a 
particular article of movable property of which he is not the owner, may be compelled 
specifically, to deliver it to the person entitled to its immediate possession in any of 
the following four cases: 
(a) When the thing claimed is held by the defendant as the agent or trustee of the 
plaintiff, (b) when the compensation in money would not afford the plaintiff adequate 
relief for the loss of the thing claimed, (c) when it would be extremely difficult to 
ascertain the actual damage caused by its loss, (d) when the possession of the thing 
claimed has been wrongfully transferred from the plaintiff. Unless and until the 
contrary is proved, the Court shall, in respect of any article of movable property 
claimed under clause (b) or (c) of this section presume that (i) compensation in 
money would not afford the plaintiff adequate relief for the loss of the thing claimed or 
as the case may be, and (ii) it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the actual 
damage caused by its loss. 
Thus under this part of the Act, if a person, who has been dispossessed, does 
not bring a suit under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act within 6 months, he may still 
bring a suit for recovery alleging any title to the property. But in this case, the suit 
may be defeated by the defendant by proving a better title.

(c) ‗A‘ is entitled to a picture by a dead painter and a pair of rare China vases. 
B has possession of them. The articles are of special character to bear an 
ascertainable market value. B may be compelled to deliver them to A. 
5. PERSONS AGAINST WHOM SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE AVAILABLE 
Section 15 lays down the parties who can bring an action for specific 
performance. 
According to Section 19, specific performance of a contract may be enforced 
against (a) either party thereto, (b) any person claiming under him, by a title arising 
subsequently to the contract except a transferee for value who has paid his money in 
good faith and without notice of the original contract, (c) any person claiming under a 
title which though prior to the contract, and known to the plaintiff, might have been 
displaced by the defendant, (d) when a company has entered into a contract and 
subsequently becomes amalgamated with another company — the new company 
which arises out of the amalgamation, (e) when the promoters of a company have 
before its incorporation entered into a contract, for the purpose of the company and 
such contract is warranted by the terms of the incorporation of the company; provided 
that the company has accepted the contract and communicated such acceptance to 
the other party to the contract. 
Clauses (a) and (b) embody the principle that Court will enforce specific 
performance of a contract not only against either party, thereto, but also against any 
person claiming under either of the parties, a title arising subsequently to the 
contract, except a transferee for value who has paid money in good faith and without 
notice of the original contract. 
Examples to clause (c) are voluntary alienness, joint tenants claiming 
survivorship and remainder man. 
6. PERSONS AGAINST WHOM SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE CANNOT BE 
ENFORCED 
Under Section 16, specific performance of a contract cannot be enforced in 
favour of a person — (a) who would not be entitled to recover compensation for its 
breach, or (b) who has became incapable of performing, or violates any essential 
term of the contract that on his part remains to be performed, or acts in fraud of the 
contract, or wilfully acts at variance with, or in subversion of, the relation intended to 
be established by the contract, or (c) who fails to aver and prove that he has 
performed or has always been ready and willing to perform the essential terms of the 
contract which are to be performed by him, other than terms the performance of 
which has been prevented or waived by the defendant. The obligation imposed by 
EP-GCL-3 
100 
Section 16 of the Act is upon the Court not to grant specific performance to a plaintiff 
who has not met the requirements of clause (a), (b) and (c) thereof. 
Thus in a suit for specific performance the plaintiff should not only plead and 
prove the terms of the agreement but should also plead and prove his readiness and 
willingness to perform his obligations under the contract in terms of the contract. 
To adjudge whether the plaintiff is ready and willing to perform his part of the 
contract, the court must take into consideration the conduct of the plaintiff prior and 
subsequent to the filing of the suit along with other attending circumstances. Right 
from the date of the execution till the date of the decree he must prove that he is 
ready and has always been willing to perform his part of the contract. N.P. 
Thirgnanam v. Dr. R Jagan Mohan Rao, AIR 1996 SC 116, (1995) 5 SCC 115. 
The continuous readiness and willingness on the part of the plaintiff is a condition 
precedent to grant the relief of specific performance. The circumstance is material 
and relevant and is required to be considered by the Court while granting or refusing 
to grant the relief.  If the plaintiff fails to either ever or prove the same he must fail. 
A Court may not, therefore, grant to a plaintiff who has failed 
to to prove that he has performed or has always been ready 
and willing to perform his part of the agreement, the specific 
performance whereof he seeks (See Ram Awadh v. Achhaibar 
Dubey, AIR 2000 SC 860).  
The explanation states that for the purpose of clause (c), (i) where a contract 
involved the payment of money, it is not essential for the plaintiff to actually tender to 
the defendant or to deposit in Court any money except when so directed by the Court 
(ii) the plaintiff must ever performance of, or readiness and willingness to perform, the 
contract according to its construction. 
Section 17 sets out two more cases where specific performance cannot be 
enforced in favour of a vendor or lessor. It states that a contract to sell or let any 
immovable property cannot be specifically enforced in favour of vendor or lessor (a) 
who knowing himself not to have any title to the property, has contracted to sell or let 
the property; (b) who, though he entered into the contract believing that he had a good 
title to the property, cannot at the time fixed by the parties or by the Court for the 
completion of the sale or letting, give the purchaser or lessee a title free from 
reasonable doubt Sub-section (2) lays down that the provisions of Sub-section (1) shall 
also apply as far as may be, to contracts for the sale or hire of movable property. 
According to this Section, a contract to sell or hire property cannot be specifically 
enforced in favour of a seller or lessor if he had no title to the property. A person who 
knows that he has no title to the property but still enters into a contract with regard to 
that property, he cannot have the remedy of specific performance. It is the duty of the 
vendor to make a reasonable, clear and marketable title about which there must not 
be any rational doubt. 
Illustration 
A without C‘s authority contracts to sell to B an estate which A knows to belong to 
C. A cannot enforce specific performance of this contract even though C is willing to 
confirm it. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
101 
Non-enforcement except with variation 
According to Section 18, where a plaintiff seeks specific performance of a 
contract in writing, to which the defendant sets up a variation, the plaintiff cannot 
obtain the performance sought, except with the variation so set up in the following 
cases, namely: (a) where by fraud, mistake of fact or misrepresentation, the written 
contract of which performance is sought is in its terms or effect different from what 
the parties agreed to, or does not contain all the terms agreed to between the parties 
on the basis of which the defendant entered into the contract; (b) where the object of 
the parties was to produce a certain legal result which the contract as framed is not 
calculated to produce, (c) where the parties have subsequently to the execution of 
the contract, varied its terms. 
Illustration 
A contracts in writing to let a house to B for a certain term, at the rent of Rs. 100/- 
per month, putting it first into tenantable repair. The house turns out to be not worth 
repairing. So with B‘s consent, A pulls it down and erects a new house in its place. B 
contracting orally to pay rent at Rs. 120/- per month. B then sues to enforce specific 
performance of the contract in writing. He cannot enforce it except with the variations 
made by the subsequent oral contract. 
7. DISCRETION OF THE COURT 
Sub-section (1) of Section 20 lays down that the jurisdiction to decree specific 
performance is discretionary, and the Court is not bound to grant such relief merely 
because it is lawful to do so, but the discretion of the Court is not arbitrary but based 
on sound and reasonable grounds guided by judicial principles and capable of 
correction by a Court of appeal. Sub-section (2) lays down that the following are 
cases in which the Court may properly exercise discretion not to decree specific 
performance — (a) where the terms of the contract or the conduct of the parties at 
the time of entering into the contract or the other circumstances under which the 
contract was entered into are such that the contract, though not voidable, gives the 
plaintiff an unfair advantage over the defendant; (b) where the performance of the 
contract would involve some hardship on the defendant which he did not foresee 
whereas its non-performance would involve no such hardship on the plaintiff;  
(c) where the defendant entered into the contract under circumstances which though 
not rendering the contract voidable, makes it inequitable to enforce specific 
performance. Explanation 1 appended to the Section states that mere inadequacy of 
consideration, or the mere fact that the contract is onerous to the defendant or 
improvident in its nature, shall not be deemed to constitute an unfair advantage within 
the meaning of clause (a) or hardship within the meaning of clause (b) Explanation 2 
to the Section says that the question whether the performance of a contract would 
involve hardship on the defendant within the meaning of clause (b) shall, except in 
cases where the hardship has resulted from any act of the plaintiff subsequent to the 
contract, be determined with reference to the circumstances existing at the time of 
the contract. 
Sub-section (3) lays down that Court may properly exercise discretion to decree 
specific performance in any case where the plaintiff has done substantial acts or 
suffered losses in consequences of a contract capable of specific performance. Sub-
EP-GCL-3 
102 
section (4) says that the court shall not refuse to any party specific performance of a 
contract merely on the ground that the contract is not enforceable at the instance of 
the other party. Specific performance is a discretionary remedy. The Court is not 
bound to decree specific performance merely because it is lawful to do so. Courts 
can take into consideration the conduct of the parties and the circumstances 
attending its execution and may exercise a discretion in granting or withholding a 
decree for specific performance (Jethalal v. Bachu, 47 Bom. 46). However, this 
discretion is not an arbitrary discretion but one governed by sound principles of 
equity.  It has been held that the court is not bound to grant relief of specific 
performance even if it is lawful to do so. [Yellapa Sastri v. Gunda Shankara, AIR 
2010 (NOC) 731 A.P. See also AIR 2008 SC 1786]. 
Illustration 
In Dennev-light (1857) 8 D M & G 774, the Court refused specific performance 
against a buyer where the land contracted to be purchased was wholly surrounded by 
land belonging to others over which there was no right of way. 
It is to be noted that the word ‗mere‘ has to be given due weight. Specific 
performance may be refused where inadequacy of consideration is coupled with 
some other factor not necessarily amounting to fraud, e.g. mistake, or surprise, or 
unfair advantage taken by the plaintiff of his superior knowledge or bargaining 
position even though the circumstances do not justify rescission of the contract. 
The hardship to be considered is at the time of the contract, unless the hardship 
has been brought on by the action of the plaintiff. Mere rise in price of the property 
agreed to be sold is not a ground for refusing a discretionary relief in favour of  
the purchaser. What has to be considered is the fairness of the contract at the time it 
was made and the subsequent rise in price is not a matter to be taken into 
consideration. 
Court‘s power to award damages in certain cases 
Under Section 21 of the Specific Relief Act, the Court is empowered to award 
compensation in certain cases. Sub-section (1) states that in a suit for specific 
performance of a contract, the plaintiff may also claim compensation for its breach, 
either in addition to, or in substitution of such performance, Sub-section (2) states 
that if, in any suit the Court decides that specific performance ought not to be granted 
but that there is a contract between the parties which has been broken by the 
defendant and that the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for that breach, it shall 
award him such compensation accordingly. Sub-section 3 lays down that if, in any 
such suit the Court decides that specific performance ought to be granted, but that it 
is not sufficient to satisfy the justice of the case, and that some compensation for 
breach of the contract should also be made to the plaintiff, it shall award him such 
compensation accordingly. Sub-section (4) states that in determining the amount of 
any compensation awarded under this section, the Court shall be guided by the 
principles specified in Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Sub-section 5 lays 
down that no compensation shall be awarded under this Section unless the plaintiff 
has claimed such compensation in his plaint provided that where the plaintiff has not 
claimed any such compensation in the plaint, the Court shall at any stage at the 
proceeding, allow him to amend the plaint on such terms as may be just for including 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
103 
a claim for such compensation. Even if the contract has become incapable of specific 
performance that does not preclude the Court from exercising the jurisdiction 
conferred by this section. 
The conditions according to which damages may be awarded by the Court in 
addition to specific performance are: 
 
(i) the Court decides that specific performance ought to be granted but, 
 
(ii) the justice of the case requires that not only specific performance but also 
some compensation for the breach of the contract should also be given to 
the plaintiff. 
 
 In a suit for specific performance, the plaintiff may ask for damages in the 
alternative or in addition to specific performance of the contract. The Court‘s 
power to award damages in a suit for specific performance is laid down in 
Section 21. 
The circumstances in which a court would award damages in lieu of specific 
performance: 
 
(a) Specific performance could have been granted but in the circumstances of 
the case the Court in its discretion considers that it would be better to award 
damages instead of specific performance. 
 
(b) Though specific performance is refused, plaintiff is entitled to compensation 
for breach of the contract. 
 
(c) If the circumstances are such that specific performance would not be 
granted; for example, where the plaintiff has disentitled himself to the 
specific performance, damages cannot be awarded under Section 21 in lieu 
of specific performance. 
Section 22 gives power to the Court to grant relief for possession, partitions, 
refund of earnest money. Under Section 22 any person, suing for the specific 
performance of a contract for the transfer of immovable property may, in an 
appropriate case ask for (a) possession or partition and separate possession, of the 
property in addition to any such performance; or (b) any other relief to which he may 
be entitled in case his claim for specific performance is refused. 
The power of the Court to grant relief under clause (b) shall be without prejudice 
to its power to award compensation under Section 21. 
Illustrations 
(a) A conveys land to B, who bequeaths it to C and dies. Thereupon D gets 
possession of the land and produces a forged instrument stating that the conveyance 
was made to B in trust for him. C may obtain the cancellation of the forged 
instrument. 
(b) A, representing that the tenants on his land were all at will, sells it to B, and 
conveys it to him by an instrument dated the 1st January 1877. Soon after that day, A 
fraudulently grants to C a lease of part of the land, and procures the lease dated the 
1st October, 1876 to be registered under the Indian Registration Act. B may obtain 
the cancellation of this lease. 
EP-GCL-3

? 
On such cancellation, the Court may require the party to whom such relief is 
granted to restore as far as may be any benefit which he may have received from the 
other party and to make any compensation to him which justice may require. 
In a case defendant and plaintiff were real brothers residing jointly in a 
house. The defendant executed agreement to sell the property of his share in 
favour of plaintiff. Subsequently he sold the same property to another 
purchaser. The subsequent purchaser had no knowledge about the earlier 
agreement. It was held that he is the bona-fide purchaser of the property. The 
plaintiff can recover back earnest money paid by him to defendant (Jagtar 
Singh v. Gurmit Singh, AIR 2006 P&H 62).

Under the Specific Relief Act, a Court can give either specific relief or compensatory 
relief and not both. 
 
True 

Correct Answer: True 
 
Section 23 lays down that even if the parties have agreed for liquidated 
damages, in the contract itself, specific performance of that contract may be decreed 
by the Court in proper cases but in that case the payment of the sum named in the 
contract will not be decreed. 
Section 24 imposes a bar on suit for compensation for breach of a contract after 
dismissal of the suit for specific performance. 
8. RECTIFICATION OF INSTRUMENTS 
Section 26 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 contains the law as to rectification of 
instruments. 
Rectification means correction of an error in an instrument in order to give effect 
to the real intention of the parties. Where a contract reduced into writing in pursuance 
of a previous agreement, fails to express the real intention of the parties, the court will 
rectify the instrument in accordance with their true intention. Here, there must be in 
existence as between the parties, a complete and perfectly unobjectionable contract; 
but the writing designed to embody it, either from fraud or mutual mistake, is incorrect 
or imperfect and the relief sought is to rectify the writing so as to bring it into 
confirmity with the true intention. In such a case, if such instrument is enforced, one 
party will suffer and if it is rescinded altogether both the parties will suffer but if it is 
rectified and enforced neither party will suffer. The principle on which the courts act in 
correcting instruments is that the parties are to be placed in the same position as that 
in which they would have stood if no error had been committed (Sudha Singh v. 
Munshi Ram, A.I.R. 1927 Cal. 605). There must have been a complete agreement 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
105 
prior to the instrument. It should be in writing and there must be clear evidence of 
mutual mistake or of fraud. 
In order to obtain rectification the conditions mentioned in Section 26 must be 
present. Thus: 
 
(i) Rectification would be granted where, though there was a consensus 
between the parties as to the contract through fraud of one of the parties, 
the instrument did not correctly express the real intention. 
 
(ii) It will also be granted, at the instance of third party, where both the parties 
are equally innocent, but owing to a common mistake, the instrument does 
not express their intention. 
 
(iii) Sub-section (2) makes it clear that rectification would not be allowed so as to 
prejudice rights acquired by third party in good faith and for value. 
 
 For example, A intending to sell to B his house and one of three godowns 
adjacent to it, executes a conveyance prepared by B in which through B‘s 
fraud, all three godowns are included. Of the two godowns which were 
fraudulently included, B gives one to C and let the other to D for a rent, 
neither C nor D having any knowledge of the fraud. The conveyance may, 
as against B and C, be rectified so as to exclude from it the godown given to 
C, but it cannot be rectified so as to affect D‘s lease. 
 
(iv) The only limitation placed on the Courts discretion is that the rectification 
can be done without prejudice to the rights acquired by third persons in good 
faith and for value. 
9. RESCISSION OF CONTRACTS 
Section 27 deals with Rescission of Contracts. ―Rescission‖ means putting an 
end to a contract which is still operative and making it null and void ab initio. It does 
not apply to void contracts. Section 27 states the principle upon which rescission can 
be ordered. A person suing for rescission cannot, in the alternative sue for specific 
performance but a person suing for specific performance can sue for rescission.  
Sub-section (1) lays down that any person interested in a contract may sue to have it 
rescinded, and such rescission may be adjudged by the Court in any of the following 
cases, namely – (a) where the contract is voidable or terminable by the plaintiff;  
(b) where the contract is unlawful for causes not apparent on its face and the 
defendant is more to blame than the plaintiff. Sub-section (2) lays down that 
notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-section (1), the Court may refuse to 
rescind the contract – (a) where the plaintiff has expressly or impliedly ratified the 
contract; or (b) where, owing to the change of circumstances which has taken place 
since the making of the contract (not being due to any act of the defendant himself), 
the parties cannot be substantially restored to the position in which they stood when 
the contract was made; or (c) where third-parties have, during the subsistence of the 
contract, acquired rights in good faith without notice and for value; or (d) where only a 
part of the contract is sought to be rescinded and such part is not severable from the 
rest of the contract. The explanation provides that in this Section, ―contract‖ in relation 
to the territories to which the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, does not extend, means 
a contract in writing. 
EP-GCL-3 
106 
? 
―This specie of specific relief is the reverse of specific performance. In one case 
the relief is granted by enforcing the performance of a contract which binds the 
parties, and the other by discharging him when it is not just to bind him‖ (Banerjee). 
So the equitable relief by way of rescission is exactly opposite of specific 
performance. Here, the contract is put to an end and is made null and void where by 
the contractual obligations also come to an end. Section 27 provides ground to the 
aggrieved party to rescind a contract without obtaining consent of the other party. 
Under clause (a) where a contract is voidable or terminable by the plaintiff, he 
may rescind it. The contract may become voidable or terminable due to fraud, undue 
influence, misrepresentation or coercion. 
Any person interested in a contract may sue to have it rescinded. Hence a suit 
may be brought by a third party whose interests are affected by the contract. 
In case of a rescission of a contract, the Court may, in its discretion, require the 
party to whom such relief is granted to make any compensation to the other party. 
The main object of this relief is to put both the parties in their original positions. If a 
plaintiff fails to get specific performance of a contract in writing, he may get it 
rescinded and delivered up to be cancelled. 
Doctrine of part performance 
The doctrine of part performance has been applied in India to the contracts of 
transfer of immovable property which though required to be registered have not been 
registered. The doctrine has been given statutory recognition in 1929 adding two new 
sections to Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act and Section 27A to the 
Specific Relief Act, and a proviso to Section 49 of the Indian Registration Act.

(c) A clear evidence of mutual mistake or fraud 
 
(d) A verbal agreement 
Correct answer: (a), (b) and (c) 
 
10. CANCELLATION OF INSTRUMENTS 
Sub-section (1) of Section 31 provides that any person against whom a written 
instrument is void or voidable, and who has reasonable apprehension that such 
instrument, if left outstanding may cause him serious injury, may sue to have it 
adjudged void or voidable, and the Court may in its discretion, so adjudge it and order 
it to be delivered up and cancelled. Sub-section (2) lays down that if the instrument 
has been registered under the Indian Registration Act, 1908, the Court shall also 
send a copy of its decree to the officer in whose office the instrument has been so 
registered; and such officer shall note on the copy of the instrument contained in his 
books the fact of its cancellation. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
107 
The relief of cancellation of instruments is founded upon the administration of 
protective justice which is technically known as ―Quia time‖. It is based upon the 
administration of protective justice for fear that the instrument may be vexatiously, or 
injuriously used by the defendant against the plaintiff when the evidence to impeach it 
may be lost or that it may throw a cloud of suspicion over the title or interest 
(Jekadula v. Bai Jini, 39 B T R.,1072). 
Relief of cancellation under Section 31 would be available when (i) an instrument 
is void or voidable against the plaintiff; (ii) where the plaintiff may apprehend serious 
injury if the instrument is left outstanding and (iii) where it is proper under the 
circumstances of the case to grant the relief. 
Illustrations 
(a) A, the owner of a ship, by fraudulently representing her to be seaworthy, 
induces B, an underwriter, to insure her. B may obtain the cancellation of the policy.  
(b) A agrees to sell and deliver a ship to B, to be paid for by B‘s acceptance of 
four bills of exchange, for sums amounting to Rs. 30,000, to be drawn by A on B. The 
bills are drawn and accepted, but the ship is not delivered according to the 
agreement. A sues B on one of the bills. B may obtain the cancellation of all the bills 
(Anglo Danubian Co. v. Rogerson (1867) L.R. 4 Eq. 3). 
Section 32 lays down that where an instrument is evidence of different rights or 
different obligations, the Court may, in proper case, cancel it in part and allow it to 
stand for the residue. The Court is not bound to cancel the whole of the instrument 
but may, in its discretion, when necessary, cancel it in part and allow rest of it to 
stand. 
A executes a deed of mortgage in favour of B. A gets back the deed from B by 
fraud and endorses on it a receipt for Rs. 1,200 purporting to be signed by B. B‘s 
signature is forged. B is entitled to have the endorsement cancelled, leaving the deed 
to stand in other respects (Ram Chandar v. Ganga Saran, (1917) 39 All. 103). 
Section 33(1) provides that on adjudging the cancellation of an instrument, the 
Court may require the party to whom such relief is granted, to restore, so far as may 
be, any benefit which he may have received from the other party and to make any 
compensation to him which justice may require. The provisions of this Section are 
almost similar to the provisions of Section 30 of this Act. Under both the Sections, the 
plaintiff must make such compensation to the defendant as the justice may require. 
11. DECLARATORY DECREES 
A declaratory decree is a decree whereby any right as to any property or the 
legal character of a person is judicially ascertained.  
The Supreme Court in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Mangilal 
Sharma, 1997 (7) SCALE 783, held that a declaratory decree 
merely declares the right of the decreehoder vis-a-vis the 
judgement debtor and does not in terms direct the 
judgement debtor to do or refrain from doing any particular 
act or thing. It cannot be executed as it only declares the 
rights of the decree-holder qua the judgement debtor and 
does not, in terms, direct him to do or refrain from doing any particular act or 
thing. 
EP-GCL-3 
108 
Section 34 lays down that any person entitled to any legal character, or to any 
right as to any property, may institute a suit against any person denying, or interested 
to deny, his title to such character or right, and the Court may in its discretion make 
therein a declaration that he is so entitled and the plaintiff need not in such suit ask 
for any further relief provided that no Court shall make any such declaration where 
the plaintiff, being able to seek further relief than a mere declaration of title, omits to 
do so. The explanation provides that a trustee of property is a ―person interested to 
deny‖ a title adverse to the title of someone who is not in existence, and for whom, if 
in existence, he would be a trustee. 
The object of declaratory decree is to remove doubt by having legal status of any 
rights declared by the Court, and to perpertuate and strengthen testimony regarding 
title and protect it from adverse attacks. One of the objects of the legislature was to 
allow the right to enjoy the property rightfully belonging to the plaintiff. In case of 
declaratory decree, neither specific performance nor any compensation is awarded 
but only a declaration of the rights of the parties is made without any consequential 
relief being granted. The declaration does not confer any new rights upon the plaintiff 
but it merely declares what he had before. It only clears the mist that has gathered 
round the plaintiff‘s title or status. The Court is being asked to put an end to the 
dispute and uncertainty by determining the legal character in issue. By that way the 
property may be put to better use, enjoyment and improvement. To maintain a suit 
under this Section following conditions must be fulfilled: 
 
(a) the plaintiff must be a person entitled to any legal character or to any right as 
to any property; 
 
(b) the defendant must be a person denying or interested to deny the plaintiff‘s 
title to such legal character or, right; 
 
(c) the declaration issued for must be a declaration that the plaintiff is entitled to 
a legal character or to a right to property; and 
 
(d) where the plaintiff is able to seek further relief than a mere declaration he 
must seek such relief. 
Illustration 
A is properly in possession of certain lands. The inhabitants of a neighbouring 
village claim a right of way across the land. A may use for a declaration that they are 
not entitled to the right so claimed. 
The relief by way of declaration is purely discretionary. Instances of legal 
characters are — 
 
(1) Divorce on the ground of impotency 
 
(2) Legal character by marriage 
 
(3) Legitimacy or illegitimacy 
 
(4) Status of an adopted son 
 
(5) Priest of temple 
Effect of Declaration 
Section 35 lays down that a declaration is binding only on the parties to the suit, 
persons claiming through them respectively, and where any of the parties are 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
109 
trustees, on the persons for whom, if in existence at the date of the declaration, such 
parties would be trustees. 
Such a declaration is not judgement in rem and as such it cannot bind strangers. 
Illustration 
A, a Hindu, in a suit to which B, his alleged wife is the defendant‘s seeks a 
declaration that his marriage was duly solemnised and prays for an order of 
restitution of conjugal rights. The Court makes the declaration and order of restitution 
of conjugal rights. C, a third-party claiming that B is his wife, sues A for the recovery 
of B. The declaration made in the former suit is not binding upon C. 
12. PREVENTIVE RELIEFS 
Part III of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 grants specific relief called Preventive 
Relief i.e., preventing a party from doing that which he is under an obligation not to 
do. Preventive relief is granted at the discretion of the court by way of an injunction. 
An injunction is a specific order of the Court forbidding the commission of a 
wrong threatened or the continuance of a wrongful course of action already begun, or 
in some cases (when it is called a ‗mandatory injunction‘) commanding active 
restitution of the former state of things. 
Lord Halsbury defines injunction as ―a judicial process whereby a party is ordered 
to refrain from doing or to do a particular act or thing‖. 
The main difference between an injunction and specific performance is that the 
remedy in case of an injunction is generally directed to prevent the violation of a 
negative act and therefore deals not only with contracts but also with torts and many 
other subjects of purely equitable one, whereas specific performance is directed to 
compelling performance of an active duty. 
It is known as a ―judicial process by which one, who has invaded or is threatening 
to invade the rights (legal or equitable) of another is restrained from continuing or 
commencing such wrongful act. Injunction is the most ordinary form of preventive 
relief. For the effective administration of justice, this power to prevent and to restrain 
is absolutely necessary. 
Characteristics of an injunction 
An injunction has three characteristic features; 
 
(a) It is a judicial process. 
 
(b) The object of this judicial process is to restrain or to prevent. 
 
(c) The act restrained or prevented is a wrongful act. An injuction acts or 
operates always in personam. 
If the wrongful act has already taken place, the injunction prevents its repetition. 
If it is merely threatened, the threat is prevented from being executed. 
Temporary and perpetual injunctions 
Section 36 states that preventive relief is granted at the discretion of the Court by 
injunction, temporary or perpetual. 
EP-GCL-3 
110 
The temporary injunctions are granted under Order 39 Rules 1-2 of the Civil 
Procedure Code while perpetual injunctions are dealt within Section 38 of the Specific 
Relief Act. 
The temporary injunction may be dissolved at any time under Civil Procedure 
Code by the defendant showing specific cause to the satisfaction of the Court against 
the order granting the injunction, or it automatically terminate with the disposal of the 
suit. The general principles governing temporary and permanent injunctions are 
mainly the same except that a temporary injunction is granted before the plaintiff 
establishes his case at the trial. 
Sub-section (1) of Section 37 lays down that temporary injunctions are such as 
are to continue until a specified time, or until the further order of the Court and they 
may be granted at any stage of a suit, and are regulated by the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908. 
Sub-section (2) states that a perpetual injunction can only be granted by the 
decree made at the hearing and upon the merits of the suit; the defendant is thereby 
perpetually enjoined from the assertion of right, or from the commission of an act, 
which would be contrary to the rights of the Plaintiff. It may be pointed out that: 
 
(i) While Section 37(1) of the Act gives the meaning of a perpetual injunction, 
Sections 37 to 62 lay down the principles according to which the perpetual 
injunction would be granted. 
 
(ii) The cases in which the perpetual injunction may be granted are of two 
classes. The object is to prevent the breach of an obligation existing in 
favour of the applicant, but such obligation may either arise out of a contract 
or otherwise. In case of contractual agreement principles governing specific 
performance will apply and in other cases, the injunction would be granted if 
the plaintiff can show that the defendant has a legal duty or obligation 
towards him and that by the non-performance of such duty the right to 
enjoyment of property has been materially affected. Such cases are where 
the defendant is trustee of the property of the plaintiff or where the injunction 
is necessary to prevent multiplicity of judicial proceedings, etc. 
Section 38 deals with granting of perpetual injunction. Sub-section (1) states that 
subject to the other provisions contained in or referred to by this chapter, a perpetual 
injunction may be granted to the plaintiff to prevent the breach of an obligation 
existing in his favour whether express or by implication. 
Sub-section (2) provides that when any such obligation arises from contract, the 
Court shall be guided by the rules and provisions contained in Chapter II, i.e., the 
chapter on specific performance of contracts. Sub-section (3) lays down that when 
the defendant invades or threatens to invade the plaintiff‘s right to, or enjoyment of 
property, the Court may grant a perpetual injunction in the following cases, namely: 
(a) where the defendant is a trustee of the property for the plaintiff; (b) where there 
exists no standard for ascertaining the actual damage caused, or likely to be caused 
by the invasion; (c) where the invasion is such that compensation in money would not 
afford adequate relief; (d) where the injunction is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of 
judicial proceedings.

(a) Divorce on the ground of impotency 
 
(b) Legal character by marriage 
 
(c) Status of an adopted son 
 
(d) Status of a relative  
Correct answer: (a), (b) and (c) 
 
Difference between the remedies of specific performance and injunction  
Specific performance is decreed to compel the performance of an active duty, while 
injunction is decreed to prevent the violation of a negative duty. Normally, the former 
deals with contracts, while the latter with torts and other subjects of equitable nature. If 
a contract is positive in its nature, it calls for the relief of specific performance, on the 
other hand, if it is negative in its nature, it calls for relief of injunction. 
The principle governing the award of injunction as a mode of enforcement of 
contracts is similar to that of specific performance. This is clearly borne out by 
Section 38(2) of the Act. Thus, the enforcement of a contract is governed by both 
specific relief and injunction. ―The jurisdiction of equity to grant such injunction is 
substantially coexistent with its jurisdiction to compel a specific performance‖. But still 
their fields of operation are separate from each other. While a promise to do is 
enforced by specific performance, a promise to forbear is enforced by injunction. 
Section 41(e) further provides that contract which will not be affirmatively enforced by 
a decree of specific performance, will not be negatively enforced by issuing an 
injunction. The only exception to this rule is found in Section 42. 
Mandatory injunction 
Section 39 dealing with mandatory injunctions states that when to prevent the 
breach of an obligation, it is necessary to compel the performance of certain acts 
which the Court is capable of enforcing, the Court may in its discretion grant an 
injunction to prevent the breach complained of, and also to compel performance of 
the requisite acts. For example, A builds a house with eaves projecting over B‘s land, 
B may sue for an injunction to pull down so much of the eaves as so projecting over 
his land. 
According to Section 40, the plaintiff in a suit for perpetual injunction under 
Section 38 or mandatory injunction under Section 39, may claim damages either in 
addition to, or in substitution for such injunction and the Court, may, if it thinks fit, 
award such damages. 
Injunction when refused 
Section 41 gives a list of cases in which a perpetual injunction cannot be granted. 
It says that an injunction cannot be granted — (a) to restrain any person from 
prosecuting a judicial proceeding pending at the institution of the suit in which the 
injunction is sought, unless such restraint is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of 
proceedings; (b) to restrain any person from instituting or prosecuting any proceeding 
EP-GCL-3 
112 
in a Court not subordinate to that from which the injunction is sought; (c) to restrain 
any person from applying to any legislative body; (d) to restrain any person from 
instituting or prosecuting any proceeding in a criminal matter; (e) to prevent the 
breach of a contract the performance of which would not be specifically enforced;  
(f) to prevent on the ground of nuisance, an act of which it is not reasonably clear that 
it will be nuisance; (g) to prevent a continuing breach in which the plaintiff has 
acquiesced; (h) when equally efficacious relief can certainly be obtained by any other 
usual mode of proceeding except in case of breach of trust; (i) when the conduct of 
the plaintiff or his agents has been such as to disentitle him to the assistance of the 
Court; (j) when the plaintiff has no interest in the matter. 
It may be noted that this relief also is a discretionary remedy. It may be refused 
even if the case is not covered by Section 41. 
Injunction to perform negative agreement 
Section 42 provides that notwithstanding anything contained in clause (e) of 
Section 41, where a contract comprises an affirmative agreement to do a certain act, 
coupled with negative agreement, express or implied, not to do a certain act, the 
circumstance that the Court is unable to compel specific performance of the 
affirmative agreement shall not preclude it from granting an injunction to perform the 
negative agreement, provided that the plaintiff has not failed to perform the contract 
so far as it is binding on him. 
This Section is based upon an English case viz., Lumley v. Wagner (21) L.J. CH. 
898. In this case Miss W, a singer agreed to sing at L’s 
theatre for a certain period and not to sing anywhere else 
during that period. Afterwards, she entered into a contract 
to sing at another theatre and refused to perform her 
contract with L. The Court refused to enforce her positive 
agreement to sing at L’s theatre (by specific performance 
since it is based on personal volition) but granted an 
injunction restraining her from singing at any other theatre thereby preventing 
breach of the negative part of the agreement though the positive part of it, 
being a contract for the personal service, could not be specifically enforced. 
Conditions necessary for the applicability of this Section are: 
 
(1) The contract should comprise of two agreements, one affirmative and 
another negative. 
 
(2) Both the agreements must be divisible. 
 
(3) The negative agreement must relate to a specific act. 
 
(4) The Court should be unable to compel specific performace of the affirmative 
agreement. 
 
(5) The plaintiff must not have failed to perform the contract, so far as it is 
binding upon him. 
A negative stipulation may be express or implied. An express negative stipulation 
in one where the negative stipulation is put expressly. The Section does not say that 
every affirmative contract includes by necessary implication a negative agreement to 
refrain from doing certain things. It is therefore a question of interpretation in each 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
113 
case to find whether a particular contract can be said to have a negative stipulation, 
express or implied, contained in it, e.g., the mere use of word ―exclusively‖ does not 
imply a negative stipulation to refrain from service of other people. 
The provisions of this Section are based on the equitable principle that ―he who 
seeks equity must do equity‖. 
The principle as laid down in Section 42 was followed in the cases of Burn 
Mcdonald (1907) 36 Cal 354; Metropolitan Electric Supply v. Ginder, (1901) 2 Ch. 
799; Subba Naidu v. Hari Badshah, (13 M.L.J. 13); and Madras Rly Co. v. Rust, 
(1891) 14 Mad 18. 
II.  LAW RELATING TO ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION 
Arbitration is the means by which parties to a dispute get the same settled 
through the intervention of a third person (or more persons) but without recourse to a 
court of law. The settlement of dispute is arrived by the judgement of the third person 
(or more persons) who are called Arbitrators. The parties repose confidence in the 
judgement of the arbitrator and show their willingness to abide by his decision. The 
essence of arbitration is thus based upon the principle of keeping away the dispute 
from the ordinary Courts enabling the parties to substitute by a domestic tribunal. It is, 
therefore, a reference of the matter of disputes to the decision of one or more 
persons between the disputing parties. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The history of the law of arbitration in India commences with Act VIII of 1859 
which codified the procedure of Civil Courts. Sections 312 to 325 of Act VIII of 1859 
dealt with arbitration between the parties to a suit while Sections 326 and 327 dealt 
with arbitration without the intervention of the Court. These provisions were in 
operation when the Indian Contract Act, 1872, came into force which permitted 
settlement of disputes by arbitration under Section 28 thereof. Act VIII of 1859 was 
followed by later codes relating to Civil Procedure, namely, Act X of 1877 and Act XIV 
of 1882 but not much change was brought about by the law relating to arbitration 
proceedings. It was in the year 1899 that an Indian Act entitled the Arbitration Act of 
1899 came to be passed. It was based on the model of the English Act of 1899. The 
1899 Act applied to cases where if the subject matter submitted to the arbitration was 
the subject of a suit, the suit could whether with leave or otherwise, be instituted in a 
Presidency town. Then came the Code of Civil Procedure of 1908. Schedule II to the 
said Code contained the provisions relating to the law of arbitration which extended to 
the other parts of British India. 
The Civil Justice Committee in 1925 recommended several changes in the 
arbitration law. On the basis of the recommendations by the Civil Justice Committee, 
the Indian Legislature passed the Act, i.e., the Arbitration Act of 1940. This Act as its 
preamble indicates is a consolidating and amending Act and is an exhaustive code 
insofar as the law relating to arbitration is concerned. An arbitration may be without 
the intervention of a Court or with the intervention of a Court where there is no suit 
pending or it may be an arbitration in a suit. 
With the passage of time the 1940 Act became outmoded, and need was 
expressed by the Law Commission of India and various representative bodies of 
trade and industry for its amendment so as to be more responsive to the 
contemporary requirements, and to render Indian economic reforms more effective.

? 
Besides, arbitration, other mechanisms of settlement of disputes such as mediation 
or conciliation should have legal recognition and the settlement agreement reached 
between the parties as a result of such mechanism should have the same status and 
effect as an arbitral award on agreed terms. 
2. ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT, 1996 
With a view to consolidate and amend the law relating to domestic arbitration, 
international commercial arbitration, enforcement of foreign arbitral awards and also 
to provide for a law relating to conciliation and related matters, a new law called 
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 has been passed. The new Law is based on 
United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), model law on 
International Commercial Arbitration. 
The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 aims at streamlining the process of 
arbitration and facilitating conciliation in business matters. The Act recognizes the 
autonomy of parties in the conduct of arbitral proceedings by the arbitral tribunal and 
abolishes the scope of judicial review of the award and minimizes the supervisory 
role of Courts. A significant feature of the Act is the appointment of arbitrators by the 
Chief Justice of India or Chief Justice of High Court. The Chief Justice may either 
appoint the arbitrator himself or nominate a person or Institution to nominate the 
arbitrator. The autonomy of the arbitral tribunal has further been strengthened by 
empowering them to decide on jurisdiction and to consider objections regarding the 
existence or validity of the arbitration agreement. 
The Act has been divided into four Parts and contains three Schedules. Part one 
deals with Arbitration (Sections 2 to 43); Part two deals with enforcement of certain 
Foreign Awards (Sections 44 to 60); Part three deals with conciliation (Sections 61 to 
81); and Part four contains supplementary provisions (Sections 82 to 86). Similarly 
schedule one contains provisions relating to convention on the Recognition and 
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards; Schedule two deals with Protocol on 
Arbitration Clauses and Schedule three contains provisions relating to Execution of 
Foreign Arbitral Awards.

3. IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS 
Arbitration 
Section 2(1) (a) of the Act, defines the term ―arbitration‖ as to mean any 
arbitration whether or not administered by a permanent arbitral institution. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
115 
Arbitrator 
The term ―arbitrator‖ is not defined in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. But 
―arbitrator‖ is a person who is appointed to determine differences and disputes 
between two or more parties by their mutual consent. It is not enough that the parties 
appoint an arbitrator. The person who is so appointed must also give his consent to 
act as an arbitrator. His appointment is not complete till he has accepted the 
reference. The arbitrator must be absolutely disinterested and impartial. He is an 
extra-judicial tribunal whose decision is binding on the parties. 
Any interest of the arbitrator either in one of the parties or in the subject-matter of 
reference unknown to either of the parties or all the parties, as the case may be, is a 
disqualification for the arbitrator. Such disqualification applies only in the case of a 
concealed interest. If the arbitrator has an interest in the subject-matter of reference 
well-known to the parties before they sign the submission, the award is good 
notwithstanding his own interest. Every disclosure which might in the least affect the 
minds of those who are proposing to submit their disputes to the arbitration of any 
particular individual as regards his selection and fitness for the post ought to be made 
so that each party may have an opportunity of considering whether the reference to 
arbitration to that particular individual should or should not be made. 
The parties may appoint whomsoever they please to arbitrate on their dispute. 
Usually the parties themselves appoint the arbitrator or arbitrators. In certain cases, 
the Court can appoint an arbitrator or umpire. The parties to an arbitration agreement 
may agree that any reference thereunder shall be referred to an arbitrator or 
arbitrators to be appointed by a person designated in the agreement either by name 
or as the holder for the time being of any office or appointment. For example, the 
parties may agree that the arbitrator shall be appointed by Mr. X or the head of a 
certain institution. 
Arbitral Award 
As per Section 2(1)(c), "arbitral award" includes an interim award. The 
definition does not give much details of the ingredients of an arbitral 
award. However, taking into account other provisions of the Act, the 
following features are noticed: 
 
1. An arbitration agreement is required to be in writing. Similarly, a reference to 
arbitration and award is also required to be made in writing. The arbitral 
award is required to be made on stamp paper of prescribed value (as 
applicable at the place of making the award) and in writing. An oral decision 
is not an award under the law. 
 
2. The award is to be signed by the members of the arbitral tribunal. However, 
the signature of majority of the members of the tribunal is sufficient if the 
reason for any omitted signature is stated. 
 
3. The making of an award is a rational process which is accentuated by 
recording the reasons. The award should contain reasons. However, there 
are two exceptions where an award without reasons is valid i.e. 
 
(a) Where the arbitration agreement expressly provides that no reasons are 
to be given, or 
EP-GCL-3 
116 
 
(b) Where the award has been made under Section 30 of the Act i.e. where 
the parties settled the dispute and the arbitral tribunal has recorded the 
settlement in the form of an arbitral award on agreed terms. 
 
 The formulation of reasons is a powerful discipline and it may lead the 
arbitrator to change his initial view on the matter. Recording of reasons 
involves, analysis of the dispute to reach a logical conclusion. Award can be 
divided into four parts i.e. general, findings of fact, submissions of the parties 
and conclusions of the tribunal. The tribunal should explain its view of the 
evidence and reasons of its conclusions. The preamble of the award may 
contain reference to the arbitration agreement, constitution of the tribunal, 
procedure adopted by the tribunal etc. and the second part of the award 
may contain points at issue, argument for the claimant, argument for the 
respondent and findings of the tribunal. The points at issue may be divided 
into two heads i.e. issue of fact and issue of law. 
 
4. The award should be dated i.e. the date of making of the award should be 
mentioned in the award. 
 
5. Place of arbitration is important for the determination of rules applicable to 
substance of dispute, and recourse against the award. The arbitral tribunal is 
under obligation to state the place of arbitration as determined in 
accordance with Section 20. Place of arbitration refers to the jurisdiction of 
the Court of a particular city or State. 
 
6. The arbitral tribunal may include in the sum for which award is made, 
interest upto the date of award and also a direction regarding future interest. 
 
7. The award may also include decisions and directions of the arbitrator 
regarding the cost of the arbitration. 
 
8. After the award is made, a signed copy should be delivered to each party for 
appropriate action like implementation or recourse against arbitral award. 
Arbitral Tribunal 
―Arbitral tribunal‖ means a sole arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators. 
[Section 2(1)(d)]. 
Court 
―Court‖ means the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district and 
includes the High Court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, having 
jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject matter of the arbitration if the 
same had been the subject matter of a suit, but does not include any Civil Court of a 
grade inferior to such principal Civil Court or any Court of Small Causes. 
[Section 2(1)(e)] 
International Commercial Arbitration 
―International commercial arbitration‖ means an arbitration relating to disputes 
arising out of legal relationships, whether contractual or not, considered as 
commercial under law in force in India and where at least one of the parties is: 
 
(i) an individual who is a national of, or habitual resident in, any country other 
than India; or 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
117 
 
(ii) a body corporate which is incorporated in any country other than India; or 
 
(iii) a company or an association or a body of individuals whose central 
management and control is exercised in any country other than India; or 
 
(iv) the Government of a foreign country. [Section 2(1)(f)] 
Legal Representative 
The definition of ―legal representative‖ given under Section 2(1)(g) has been 
taken verbatim from the definition in Section 2(11) of the Code of Civil Procedure. 
The following are the persons who are legal representatives: 
 
(a) A person who in law represents the estate of a deceased person. 
 
(b) A person who intermeddles with the estate of the deceased. 
 
(c) A person on whom the estate of a deceased person devolves on the death 
of the party acting in a representative‘s capacity. 
The following persons are generally included in the list of legal representatives. 
 
(i) Executors and administrators properly appointed. 
 
(ii) Person who has taken on himself duties and responsibilities which belong to 
the executor or administrator though only in respect of a part of the estate. 
 
(iii) Heirs-at-law whether they take succession or by survivorship. 
 
(iv) Revisioners when the action has been brought by or against the widow 
representing her husband‘s estate. 
 
(v) Universal legatee. 
The following are the illustrations of those who do not come within the meaning of 
legal representative, so far as the Act is concerned: 
 
(i) An assignee from a deceased zamindar or to whom the holding reverts on 
the death of a tenant. 
 
(ii) A trespasser or a person who claims adversely the estate of the deceased. 
 
(iii) A new trustee appointed or elected on the death of the deceased trustee. 
Arbitration Agreement 
―Arbitration agreement‖ means an agreement referred to in Section 7 
[Section 2(1)(b)]. Under Section 7, the ―Arbitration agreement‖ has 
been defined to mean an agreement by parties to submit the 
arbitration or certain disputes which have arisen or which may arise 
between them in respect of a defined legal relationship whether contractual or not. 
Sub-section (2) says that an arbitration agreement may be in the form of an 
arbitration clause in a contract or in the form of a separate agreement. Sub-section 
(3) specifically states that an arbitration agreement shall be in writing. Sub-section (4) 
spells out that an arbitration agreement is in writing if it is contained in 
 
(a) a document signed by the parties, or 
 
(b) an exchange of letters, telex, telegrams or other means of telecommuni-
cation, which provide a record of the agreement, or 
 
(c) an exchange of statements of claim and defence in which the existence of 
the agreement is alleged by one party and not denied by the other. 
EP-GCL-3 
118 
Thus, arbitration agreement stands on the same footing as any 
other agreement. It is binding upon the parties unless it is influenced by 
fraud or coercion or undue influence, etc. As per Section 7, one of the 
essential ingredients of an arbitration agreement is that such an 
agreement should be in writing. An oral arbitration agreement is not recognised as an 
arbitration agreement according to this Section. 
Sub-section (5) states that the reference in a contract to a document containing 
an arbitration clause constitutes an arbitration agreement if the contract is in writing 
and the reference is such as to make that arbitration clause part of the contract. 
Sub-section (3) only requires that an agreement by the parties should be in writing. 
It is not necessary that the words arbitration, arbitrator or arbitration agreement should 
appear in the arbitration clause so long as the parties have valid agreement to allow the 
matter of dispute to be decided by persons of their own choice. 
Under the present law, certain disputes such as matrimonial disputes, criminal 
prosecutions, questions relating to guardianship about the validity of a will, etc. are 
treated as not suitable for arbitration. Subject to this qualification Section 7(1) of the 
Act makes it permissible to enter into an arbitration agreement ―in respect of a 
defined legal relationship, whether contractual or not‖. 
Under the old law, it was not clear whether an arbitrator can decide questions 
about the validity of the arbitration agreement itself or about the existence and validity 
of the arbitration clause proper. The new law expressly recognizes that the arbitrator 
will have such a power to commence or continue the arbitral proceedings though the 
objecting party can obtain a ruling of the court at the appropriate time.  
The Supreme Court in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. v. M/s Pink City 
Midway Petroleum, AIR 2003 SC 2881 has held that the jurisdiction of Civil 
Court is barred after an application under Section 8 of the Act is made for 
arbitration.  
In Mahesh Kumar v. Rajasthan State Road Corporation, AIR 2006 Raj 56, the 
Rajasthan High Court has held that mere existence of arbitration clause in agreement 
does not bar jurisdiction of Civil Court automatically. The objection of a party to the 
jurisdiction of the arbitrator must be raised not later than the submission of its first 
statement of defence on the substance of the dispute [Section 8(1) and 8(3)].

4. APPOINTMENT OF ARBITRATORS 
Section 11 of the Act deals with appointment of arbitrators. According 
to this Section, parties can agree to any procedure for appointment of 
arbitrators. But provisions have been made to ensure timely 
appointments as under: 
 
(a) The parties may agree to a procedure of appointment of arbitrators. 
Otherwise the following procedure shall apply : 
 
(i) Arbitrator could be of any nationality. [Section 11(1)] 
 
(ii) In case of an arbitration with three arbitrators, each party shall appoint 
its own arbitrator, and the two appointed arbitrators shall appoint a third 
arbitrator, who shall be the presiding arbitrator [Section 11(3)]. 
 
(iii) If, within 30 days, the parties fail to appoint their arbitrators, or the two 
appointed arbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator, the arbitrator 
shall be appointed by the Chief Justice or any person or institution 
designated by him at the request of a party. [Section 11(4)] 
 
(iv) Similar procedure is also applicable for appointment of a sole arbitrator. 
If parties fail to agree on the appointment of a sole arbitrator within 30 
days, the appointment shall be done by the Chief Justice or a 
person/institution designated by him. 
 
(b) Similar procedure also applies, when the procedure agreed by the parties is 
not acted upon in time. [Section 11(6)] 
 
(c) Decision on appointment of arbitrators by the Chief Justice or persons/ 
institution designated by him, is final [Section 11(7)]. 
 
(d) Chief Justice or the persons/Institution designated by him would have due 
regard to qualifications of arbitrators agreed between the parties, and 
considerations likely to secure an independent and impartial arbitrator. 
[Section 11(8)] 
 
(e) In case of appointment of a sole or third arbitrator in an international 
commercial arbitration, the Chief Justice of India or a person/Institution 
designed by him, may appoint a person of a nationality, other than that of 
the parties, where the parties are of different nationalities. [Section 11(9)] 
 
(f) The Chief Justice can make any Scheme, he considers appropriate for 
appointment of arbitrators under Sub-section (4), (5) or (6). 
In a case original agreement was given a go-by and a new procedure for 
appointment of arbitrator was agreed upon by the parties. However, respondent failed 
to appoint an arbitrator according to new method also. Calcutta High Court held that 
the other party can very well approach the court for appointment of an arbitrator 
under Section 11(5) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (Manoranjan Mandal 
and others v. Union of India and others, AIR 1999 Cal. 117). 
EP-GCL-3 
120 
It has been held by the Supreme Court in M/s S.B. P. & Co. v. M/s Patel Engg. 
Ltd., AIR 2006 SC 450 that the power exercised by the Chief Justice of the High 
Court or the Chief Justice of India under Section 11(6) of the 
Act is not an administrative power. It is a Judicial power. 
The power under Section 11(6) of the Act in its entirety, 
could be delegated, by the Chief Justice of the High Court 
only to another Judge of that Court and by the Chief Justice 
of India to another Judge of the Supreme Court. Designation 
of a District Judge as the authority under Section 11(6) of 
the Act by the Chief Justice of the High Court is not warranted on the Scheme 
of the Act. 
The mode of appointment of arbitrator may not always work very smoothly in 
actual practice. But this may provide further opportunities for the organisations like 
Indian Council of Arbitration, International Centre for Alternate Dispute Resolution 
etc. Under the Act, an arbitrator before accepting his appointment is required to 
disclose to the parties in writing about such matters which may create doubts about 
his impartiality or independence. Where such doubts exist, his appointment can be 
challenged. Similarly, where the arbitrator does not possess the required or the 
agreed qualification for the appointment, his appointment can be challenged as per 
Sections 12 and 13 of the Act. 
Number of arbitrators 
Section 10 of the Act provides that, the parties are free to determine the number 
of arbitrators, provided that such number shall not be an even number. If they fail to 
determine the number of arbitrators, the arbitral tribunal shall consist of a sole 
arbitrator. 
There is nothing in Section 7 to indicate the requirement of the number of 
arbitrators as a part of the arbitration agreement. Thus, the validity of an arbitration 
agreement would not depend on the number of arbitrators specified therein. The 
number of arbitrators is dealt with separately in Section 10 which is a part of the 
machinery provision for the working of the arbitration agreement. It is therefore, clear 
that an arbitration agreement specifying an even number of arbitrators could not be a 
ground to render the arbitration agreement invalid under the Act (MMTC Ltd. v. 
Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd., (1996) 8 Scale 305). 
Grounds for challenge 
The appointment of arbitrators made under Section 11 of the Act, can be 
challenged on the grounds as specified in Section 12 of the Act. For that purpose, 
Section 13 contains the procedure. According to Section 12 of the Act when a person 
is approached in connection with his possible appointment as an arbitrator, he shall 
disclose in writing any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his 
independence or impartiality. Some examples of such circumstances may be blood 
relationship or pecuniary relationship with either party to the dispute. Moreover, an 
arbitrator, from the time of his appointment and throughout the arbitral proceedings, 
shall without delay, disclose to the parties in writing any circumstances referred to 
above unless they have already been informed of them by him. An arbitrator may be 
challenged by a party only if (1) circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts 
as to his independence or impartiality, or (2) he does not possess the qualifications 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
121 
agreed to by the parties. Sub-section 4 of Section 12 makes it clear that a challenge 
is also permitted, if a party becomes aware of these grounds after an appointment is 
made. 
Challenge procedure 
Section 13 of the Act contains detailed provisions regarding challenge procedure. 
Sub-section (1) provides that subject to provisions of Sub-section (4), the parties are 
free to agree on a procedure for challenging an arbitrator. Sub-Section (4) states that 
if a challenge under any procedure agreed upon by the parties or under the 
procedure under Sub-section (2) is not successful, the arbitral tribunal shall continue 
the arbitral proceedings and make an arbitral award. But at that stage, the 
challenging party has the right to make an application in the Court to set aside the 
award in accordance with Section 34 of the Act. 
Sub-section (2) provides that failing any agreement referred to in Sub-section (1) 
of Section 13, a party who intends to challenge an arbitrator shall, within 15 days 
after becoming aware of the constitution of the arbitral tribunal or after becoming 
aware of any circumstances referred to in Sub-section (3) of Section 12, send a 
written statement of the reasons for the challenge to the arbitral tribunal. The tribunal 
shall decide on the challenge unless the arbitrator challenged under sub-section (2) 
withdraws from his office or the other party agrees to the challenge. It is also provided 
that where an award is set aside on an application made under Sub-section (5) of 
Section 13 of the Act, the Court may decide as to whether the arbitrator who is 
challenged is entitled to any fees. 
Failure or impossibility to act as an arbitrator 
As per Section 14(1), the mandate of an arbitrator shall terminate, if he becomes 
de jure or de facto unable to perform his functions, or fails to act without undue delay 
due to some other reasons. Mandate is also terminated, if he withdraws from his 
office, or the parties agree to the termination of his mandate. 
Further, if there is a controversy about an arbitrator‘s inability to function or 
occurrence of undue delay, a party may seek intervention of the Court under  
Section 14(2). 
However, withdrawal by arbitrator on his own or by agreement between the 
parties does not constitute acceptance of the grounds of challenge. 
It is considered that the procedure for challenge to the appointment of an 
arbitrator need not be a matter of agreement by parties. The procedure in Section 13 
should apply in all cases. 
Substitution of Arbitrator 
 
(1) In addition to the circumstances referred to in Section 13 or Section 14, the 
mandate of an arbitrator shall terminate— 
 
(a) where he withdraws from office for any reasons; or 
 
(b) by or pursuant to agreement of the parties. 
 
(2) Where the mandate of an arbitrator terminates, a substitute arbitrator shall 
be appointed according to the rules that were applicable to such 
appointment being replaced. 
EP-GCL-3 
122 
 
(3) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, where an arbitrator is replaced 
under Sub-section (2), any hearings previously held may be repeated at the 
discretion of the arbitral tribunal. 
 
(4) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an order or ruling of the arbitral 
tribunal made prior to the replacement of an arbitrator under this Section 
shall not be invalid solely because there has been a change in the 
composition of the arbitral tribunal [Section 15]. 
5. ARBITRAL PROCEEDINGS 
Place and commencement of arbitration 
As per Section 20 of the Act, the parties are free to agree on the place of 
arbitration and if they fail to reach an agreement, the place of arbitration is 
determined by the arbitral tribunal, having regard to the circumstances of the case, 
including the convenience of the parties. Section 20(3) introduces an option by 
providing that the arbitrator/tribunal may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, may 
meet at any place it considers appropriate for consultation among its members, for 
hearing witnesses, experts or the parties, or for inspection of documents, goods or 
other property. Section 31(4) makes it mandatory for the arbitral tribunal to state in 
the arbitral award the date and the place of arbitration as determined in accordance 
with Section 20 and the award is then deemed to have been made at that place. Part-
II of the Act deals with foreign awards and is applicable to those awards made 
outside the territory of India. Hence, place of arbitration has far reaching effect in 
terms of law applicable to arbitration and also enforcement of the arbitral award in 
international commercial arbitration.Place of arbitration in an arbitration other than 
international commercial arbitration i.e. in domestic arbitration, does not pose any 
problem. Parties may agree on the place of arbitration anywhere in India. But in 
international commercial arbitration, place of arbitration has legal implications in 
terms of law applicable to arbitration. In domestic arbitration, the arbitral tribunal has 
to decide the dispute in accordance with the Indian law, but in international 
commercial arbitration, parties have been given freedom to designate law applicable 
to the substance of the dispute and the arbitral tribunal may apply the rules of law 
agreed by the parties. 
The old Act did not explain in clear terms the point of commencement of 
arbitration. This difficulty is removed by Section 21 of the new Act stating that the 
arbitral proceedings commence on the date on which a request for that dispute to be 
referred to arbitration is received by the respondent. No time limit has been 
prescribed under the Act. However, where the arbitrator is guilty of undue delay, his 
proceedings can be put to a stop as per Section 14(1) of the Act. 
Language of arbitration 
Section 22 gives freedom to parties to agree upon the language or languages to 
be used in the arbitral proceedings. The arbitral tribunal, subject to agreement of 
parties, has power to determine the language or languages to be used in the arbitral 
proceedings. Generally, the language of arbitration is English. It being the 
international language, the same is agreed in most of the arbitrations by the parties 
and the arbitral tribunal. The arbitral tribunal may ask for translation of documentary 
evidence into the or languages agreed upon by the parties or determined by the 
arbitral tribunal.

Correct Answer:  a, b and c 
 
Arbitration procedure 
Sections 23 to 27 stipulate the procedure to be followed in arbitration 
proceedings. Under the old law the practice adopted by the Arbitrator regulated the 
different stages of arbitration. The new law gives a comprehensive guidance 
regarding the procedure such as filing of a claim, submission of difference, 
amendment of claim/deferences etc. Sections 23 and 24 of the Act set out the stages 
of arbitration proceedings in an orderly manner. Section 23 of the Act provides that: 
 
(1) Within the period of time agreed upon by the parties as determined by the 
arbitral tribunal, the claimant shall state the facts supporting his claim, the 
points at issue and the relief or remedy sought, and the respondent shall 
state his defence in respect of these particulars, unless the parties have 
otherwise agreed as to the required elements of those statements. 
 
(2) The parties may submit with their statements all documents they consider to 
be relevant or may add a reference to the documents or other evidence they 
will submit. 
 
(3) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, either party may amend or 
supplement his claim or defence during the course of the arbitral 
proceedings, unless the arbitral tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow 
the amendment or supplement having regard to the delay in making it. 
Section 18 lays down two obligations on the arbitral tribunal i.e. to treat the party 
with equality and to give full opportunity to each party to present his case. Section 18 
which is one of the most significant Sections, constitutes a fundamental principle 
which is applicable to entire proceedings. The principle of equality and full opportunity 
to present the case should be observed by the parties also, when laying down any 
rules of procedure. An agreed procedure which violates the fundamental principle of 
equality and granting of an opportunity of being heard, is null and void and an award 
passed in violation of this principle can be set aside. Section 34(2) provides that an 
award may be set aside if the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the 
agreement of the parties, unless such agreement was in conflict with a provision of 
the law from which parties cannot derogate, or, failing such agreement, was not in 
accordance with law. Hence, an agreement cannot be in conflict with a mandatory 
provision of the law. If procedure agreed by the parties violates the fundamental 
principles, it cannot be enforced by the arbitral tribunal. The principle enshrined in 
Section 18 should be observed during the entire arbitral proceedings. The principle 
EP-GCL-3 
124 
does not entitle a party to adopt delaying tactics to obstruct the proceedings. The 
general principle is, however, subject to other provisions contained in Sections 23, 24 
and 25, wherein the right can be curtailed or limited by the parties or by the arbitral 
tribunal in certain cases. The parties may agree that arbitration be conducted on the 
basis of documents only under Section 23(1). Hence, Section 18 is influenced by 
Sections 23, 24 and 25 and at the same time Section 18 must also influence these 
Sections. The arbitral tribunal has to maintain a balance for smooth conduct of the 
proceedings and has to make the parties feel that the arbitral tribunal is giving them 
full opportunity to present documents, witnesses and arguments. The parties are 
entitled to legal representation by the person of their choice and if disallowed, it could 
be violation of the principle of giving a full opportunity of presenting the case. 
Section 24 of the Act deals with hearings and written proceedings. There is no 
restriction upon the parties to agree for holding oral hearings for presentation of 
evidence and for oral arguments or, alternatively, for conducting the proceedings on 
the basis of documents. Otherwise the arbitral tribunal shall decide whether to hold 
oral hearing for the presentation of evidence or for oral argument, or whether the 
proceedings shall be conducted on the basis of documents and other materials, 
provided that arbitral tribunal shall hold hearings, at an appropriate stage of the 
proceedings, on a request by a party, unless the parties agreed that no oral hearings 
shall be held. 
Sub-section 2 of Section 24 requires that the parties shall be given sufficient 
advance notice of any hearing and of any meeting of the arbitral tribunal for the 
purpose of inspection of documents, goods or other property. Further Section 24 
provides that all documents/statements/other information received from one party 
must be communicated to the other parties. 
Statements of claims and defence 
Within the period of time agreed upon by the parties or determined by the 
tribunal, the claimant has to state the facts in supporting his claim, the points at issue 
and the relief or remedy sought. Similarly, the respondent shall also state his defence 
in respect of these particulars. 
Submission of documents 
Sub-section (2) of Section 23 provides that the parties may submit with their 
statements all documents they consider to be relevant or may add a reference to the 
documents or other evidence which they will submit later on. 
Amendments 
Parties may amend or supplement these statements during the proceedings, 
unless: 
 
(1) Parties have agreed otherwise, or 
 
(2) Arbitral tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow the amendment or 
supplement, due to delay in making it. 
Determination of rules of arbitral procedure 
According to Section 19(1) the arbitral tribunal is neither bound by the Code of 
Civil Procedure 1908, nor by the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. The Code of Civil 
Procedure is the Code of Civil Judicature and provides rules relating to suits, place of 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
125 
suing, summons and discovery, judgement and decree, interest, costs etc. The 
Evidence Act makes the law relating to evidence and applies to all judicial 
proceedings in or before the Court but not to proceedings before any arbitral tribunal. 
The arbitral tribunal is not bound to follow the procedure as followed by a Court. 
However, the arbitral tribunal is to observe fundamental principles envisaged under 
the Code of Civil Procedure and the Evidence Act. The procedure adopted by the 
arbitral tribunal should be according to the principles of natural justice. 
Section 19(2) provides that subject to provisions of the Part I, the parties are free 
to agree on a procedure to be followed by the arbitral tribunal in conducting its 
proceedings. Rules of permanent arbitral Institutions usually deal with procedural 
matters in detail and are generally well tested in practice and are revised after 
consultation with experts to take into account fresh development in the law and 
practice of arbitration. Parties generally incorporate arbitration rules of a particular 
institution by reference to the same in the agreement. The arbitral tribunal does not 
have any discretion where any such rule has been provided for in the agreement 
itself. 
The arbitral tribunal may conduct the proceedings in the manner it considers 
appropriate, but such power is subject to two exceptions mentioned below: 
 
(1) The arbitral tribunal cannot conduct the proceedings in a manner which is in 
violation of the mandatory provisions of the law. 
 
(2) The arbitral tribunal cannot conduct proceedings in a manner which is in 
violation of the procedure agreed by the parties, if any. Where parties have 
agreed on the procedure to be followed by the arbitral tribunal in conducting 
its proceedings the arbitral is bound to follow that procedure. 
There is no mandatory provision in the Act as to how to determine the 
admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of evidence. The parties may agree on 
the rules relating to this important aspect of the matter. However, if there are no 
agreed rules by the parties, the arbitral tribunal has power to determine the 
admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of any evidence and make decision in 
the manner it considers appropriate. Section 19 recognizes the freedom of the parties 
to lay down as to how to conduct the proceedings subject to agreement of the parties. 
Freedom to lay down rules of procedure is, subject to following restrictions 
(mandatory provisions) laid down by law: 
 
(1) Submission of a statement of a claim and defence under Section 23. 
 
(2) The parties should be given sufficient advance notice of any hearing and of 
any meeting of the arbitral tribunal for purposes of inspection of documents, 
goods or other property under Section 24(2). 
 
(3) All statements, documents or other information supplied to or applications 
made to the arbitral tribunal by one party should be communicated to the 
other party and any expert report or evidentiary document on which arbitral 
tribunal may rely in making its decision should be communicated to the 
parties, as per Section 24(3). 
 
(4) The arbitral tribunal, or a party with the approval of the arbitral tribunal, is 
allowed to request the Court in taking evidence under Section 27. 
EP-GCL-3 
126 
 
(5) An award in agreed terms must state that it is an award and should be in 
accordance with Section 30. 
 
(6) An arbitral award must be in writing an signed by the majority of all the 
members of the arbitral tribunal as per Section 31(1). 
 
(7) The arbitral award must state its date and place of arbitration under  
Section 31(4). 
 
(8) A copy of the award duly signed by the arbitral tribunal should be delivered 
to each party under Section 31(5). 
 
(9) The arbitral proceedings are terminated by the final arbitral award or by an 
order of the arbitral award under Section 32(2). 
 (10) The arbitral tribunal has power to correct any computation errors, any 
clerical or typographical errors or any other errors of a similar nature and to 
give interpretation of a specific point or part of the award under Section 33. 
Judges are bound by the Code of Civil Procedure and also by the Rules of the 
Court while conducting proceedings in the Court. There is no corresponding 
arbitration procedure and rules. Permanent arbitral institutions have their own sets of 
arbitration rules, but those rules do not regulate the procedure in detail. The arbitral 
tribunal is master of the procedure of arbitration, subject, of course, to restrictions 
imposed by law, agreement of parties and natural matter for a quick and cheap 
resolution of disputes. 
Power to terminate/continue the proceedings 
Section 25 of the Act provides that subject to agreement between the parties, where, 
without showing sufficient cause, the claimant fails to communicate his statement of 
claim within the agreed period, the arbitration proceedings shall be terminated by the 
arbitrator. Similarly, where the respondent fails to communicate his statement of 
defence within the predetermined period, the arbitrator shall continue the proceedings 
without treating such failure, in itself, as an admission of the claimant‘s allegations. 
Further, when a party fails to appear at an oral hearing or to produce documentary 
evidence in support of its averment, the arbitrator can proceed and pronounce the 
award on the basis of evidence available before it. Thus, the general principles of ex 
party proceedings will apply to arbitration proceedings also. 
Appointment of experts by Arbitral Tribunal 
Section 26(1) of the Act, provides for appointment of experts subject to 
agreement between the parties. Clause (b) of Sub-section (1) of the Section obligates 
the parties to provide the expert access to necessary information and documents. 
The provisions stipulated under Section 26(3) imposes a duty on the expert to 
make available to the parties on their request the various documents etc. on which 
the expert has based his report. 
Decision by majority 
Section 29 of the Act provides for decision by majority where there is more than 
one arbitrator. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
127 
Court assistance 
Provisions are also made under the Act relating to Court assistance in taking 
evidence. Section 27 of the Act provides that the arbitral tribunal, or a party with the 
approval of the arbitral tribunal, may apply to the court for assistance in taking 
evidence. For this purpose the application must specify the names and addresses of 
the parties and the arbitrators, general nature of the claim and the relief sought and 
the evidence to be obtained particularly (1) the name and address of any person to 
be heard as witness or expert witness and a statement of the subject matter of the 
testimony required; (2) the description of any document to be produced or property to 
be inspected. According to Sub-section (3), the Court may execute the request by 
ordering that the evidence be provided directly to the arbitral tribunal. Parties shall be 
subject to the same disadvantage, punishments and penalties by order of the Court, 
as they would incur for the like offences in suits tried by the Court when persons fail 
to attend, or make a default, or refuse to give evidence or guilty of contempt of the 
tribunal during the conduct of the proceedings. 
Jurisdiction of Arbitral Tribunals 
The arbitral tribunal is empowered to rule its own jurisdiction including any 
objections in relation to existence and validity of the arbitration agreement. Secton 16 
of the Act relates to competence of arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction, including 
ruling on any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration 
agreement. For this purpose: 
 
(1) an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an 
agreement independent of other terms of the contract; and 
 
(2) a decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not 
entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause. 
Section 16 also contains in its ambit pleas of non-jurisdiction or excess of 
authority. Sub-section (2) of Section 16 provides that a plea can be raised not later 
than the submission of the statement of defence where the arbitral tribunal does not 
have jurisdiction. It is further provided that a party shall not be precluded from raising 
such a plea merely because he has appointment or participated in the appointment of 
an arbitrator. Likewise, Sub-section (3) of Section 16 provides that a plea that the 
arbitral tribunal is exceeding the scope of its authority, could be raised by the party 
during the arbitral proceedings, if the matter alleged, is beyond the scope of its 
authority. Sub-section (4) of Section 16 gives discretionary power to arbitral tribunal 
to admit a later plea. It provides that the tribunal may, in either of the cases referred 
to in Sub-section (2) or Sub-section (3) admit a later plea if it considers the delay 
justified. The arbitral tribunal shall decide on a plea referred to it in Sub-section (2) or 
Sub-section (3) and where the tribunal takes a decision rejecting the plea, it shall 
continue with the arbitral proceedings and make an arbitral award. [Section 16(5)] 
An application for setting aside the award may be made in the Court by a party 
aggrieved by such an arbitral award. The application should be made in accordance 
with Section 34 of the Act. 
It is important to note that under the Arbitration Act, 1940 if the contract is 
perished the arbitration clause also perished with the contract. But under the Act, 
there is a departure from the old Act in this regard. Under the Act if a contract is 
EP-GCL-3 
128 
declared null or void, it does not mean that arbitration is not valid. In other words, 
under the Act, the clause or an arbitration agreement is to be treated as a clause or 
an agreement and independent from the other terms of the contract and therefore the 
validity of the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is not affected by the 
modification or recession, invalidity or revocation of the contract. 
Interim measures ordered by Arbitral Tribunal 
Interim measures are made in the interest of justice and the jurisdiction of the 
tribunal for interim measures is limited to the subject matter of dispute. Section 17 of 
the Act relates to interim measures ordered by the tribunal whereas Section 9 of the 
Act authorises a court to order interim measures. Section 17 provides that unless the 
parties have specifically agreed, the tribunal may order a party for taking any interim 
measure of protection as the tribunal may consider necessary in respect of subject 
matter of the dispute. For obtaining an order, an application must be made by a party. 
As per Sub-section (2) of Section 17 the tribunal may ask a party to provide 
appropriate security in connection with the protective measures ordered by it under 
sub-section (1) of Section 17. 
Interim measures are temporary and provisional. They are operative till the 
dispute is resolved by an award to protect the interest of a party. 
Arbitral award 
Section 31 of the Act lays down the requirements as to form and contents of an 
arbitration award. An award must be a speaking order i.e. it must state the reasons, 
unless the parties have specifically agreed that reasons need not be given or the 
award is based on agreed terms. The award should state the reasons upon which it is 
based. In other words, unless (a) the parties have agreed that no reasons are to be 
given or (b) the award is an arbitral award on agreed terms under Section 30 of the 
Act, the award should state the reasons in support of determination of the 
liability/non-liability. The legislature has not accepted the ratio of Constitution Bench 
in the Chokhamal Contractor‘s case (AIR 1990 SC 1426), that the award, being in the 
private law field, need not be a speaking award even where the award relates to the 
contract of private parties or between person and the Government or public sector 
undertakings (Tamil Nadu Electricity Board v. Bridge Tunnel Constructions & Others, 
AIR 1997 SC 1376). Date and Place are to be mentioned in the award in accordance 
with Section 20 of the Act and the award should be deemed to have been made at 
that place. 
Section 31(1) requires that the award shall be made in writing and shall be 
signed by the members of the arbitral tribunal. According to Sub-section (5) of 
Section 31 of the Act, a signed copy of the same is to be delivered to each party. 
Interim award 
The arbitral tribunal can make an interim award on any matter with respect to 
which it may make a final award (See also Section 2(1)(c) of the Act). 
Award of interest 
Section 31(7) of the Act provides as under: 
 
(a) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, where and in sofar as an arbitral 
award is for the payment of money, the arbitral tribunal may include in the 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
129 
? 
sum for which the award is made, interest at such rate as it deems 
reasonable, on the whole or any part of the money, for the whole or any part 
of the period between the date on which the cause of action arose and the 
date on which the award is made. 
 
(b) A sum directed to be paid by an arbitral award shall, unless the award 
otherwise directs, carry interest at the rate of eighteen per cent per annum 
from the date of the award to the date of payment. 
Finality of arbitral awards 
Section 35 of the Act corresponds to the Article 35(1) of UNCITRAL Model Law. 
The Section 35 of the Act provides that subject to the provisions of Part-I of the Act 
the award shall be final and binding on the parties and persons claiming under it. In 
other words an arbitral award is final and binding on the parties and the persons 
claiming under the same, subject to time limit prescribed under Sections 33 and 34 of 
the Act.

Correct answer: (b) 
 
Correction and interpretation of an award 
Section 33 of the Act deals with correction and interpretation of an award, or 
additional award. 
The award may be corrected by the arbitral tribunal within 30 days of the receipt 
of the award. For that purpose, a party, with notice to the other party, may request the 
tribunal to correct any computation errors, any clerical or typographical errors or any 
other errors of a similar nature occurring in the award. If so agreed by the parties, a 
party, with notice to the other party, may request the arbitral tribunal to give an 
interpretation of a specific point or part of the award. Sub-section (1) of Section 33 
also provides that the parties may agree upon a period of time other than 30 days for 
the request. 
If the tribunal finds that the request is reasonable, it shall make a correction or 
give an interpretation, within 30 days of the receipt of the request. However, the 
tribunal may extend if necessary, the period of time within which it shall make a 
correction, give an interpretation of arbitral award under the provisions of Sub-section 
(6) of Section 33 of the Act. The interpretation shall be treated as part of the award. 
Likewise, the arbitral tribunal may also correct any errors, on its own within 30 days 
from the date of the award. That time cannot be extended by the tribunal. 
EP-GCL-3 
130 
Additional award 
Sub-section (4) of Section 33 contains provisions for making additional award. It 
provides that unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a party with notice to the other 
party, may request the tribunal to make an additional award as to claims presented in 
the arbitral proceedings but omitted from the arbitral award. Such request may be 
made within 30 days from the receipt of the arbitral award. If the arbitral tribunal 
considers the above request reasonable, the tribunal shall make the additional 
arbitral award within 60 days of the request. The time period of 60 days may be 
extended by the tribunal if necessary. 
The provisions of Section 31 of the Act shall be applicable to a correction or an 
interpretation of the award or to an additional award. 
Enforcement of award 
Section 36 of the Act provides that if the time for making an application to set 
aside the award has expired or the application has been refused, the award shall be 
enforced under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in the same manner as it were a 
decree of the Court. 
6. PROVISIONS REGARDING SETTING ASIDE AN AWARD 
The parties can approach the Court for setting aside the Award. Section 2(e) 
specifically provides that "Court" means the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction 
in a district, including High Court and excludes any Civil Court of grade inferior to 
such principal Civil Court or any Court of small causes. 
An application may be made in accordance with Sub-section (2) and 
Sub-section (3) of Section 34 of the Act for setting aside an arbitral 
award. 
Sub-section (2) of Section 34, stipulates the following grounds on which the 
award may be challenged before the Court: 
 
(i) incapacity of a party; 
 
(ii) invalidity of the arbitration agreement; 
 
(iii) party applying was not given proper notice of the apointement of the 
arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present 
his case; 
 
(iv) award not in accordance with the terms of submission to arbitration in regard 
to the dispute; 
 
(v) arbitral tribunal not properly constituted or the arbitral procedure was not in 
accordance with the agreement of the parties; 
 
(vi) subject matter of the dispute not capable of settlement by arbitration under 
the law for the time being in force; 
 (vii) award being in conflict with ‗the public policy of India‘. 
Explanation to Sub-section (2)(b) provides that an award would be in conflict with 
public policy if it is induced or affected by fraud or corruption or violates Section 75 or 
Section 81 of the Act relating to confidentiality and admissibility of evidence in other 
proceedings. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
131 
Section 34(3) of the Act prescribes the time limit for making an application for 
setting aside an arbitral award. The application cannot be made after three months 
have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received 
the arbitral award or if a request had been made under Section 33 from the date on 
which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal. It is further provided 
that the period of three months could be extended to a maximum of 30 days by the 
Court but not thereafter if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by 
sufficient cause from making the application within the said period. 
Interim measures by the Court 
Section 9 of the Act relates to interim measures by the Court. These measures 
can be ordered by the Court, on an application by a party before or during the arbitral 
proceedings or at any time before the enforcement of an award. It is based on 
Section 9 of the UNICITRAL Model Law on International Commercial arbitration. The 
intention of the legislators in incorporating Section 9 is quite explicit that the party 
before arbitral proceedings or at any time after making of the award but before its 
enforcement can apply to the Court for interim relief. In Ashok Chawla v. Rakesh 
Gupta, (1996) 2 Arb. L-J. 255, it has been held that in the absence of any prayer 
for substantive relief, the prayer for issuing any directions by way of interim 
measures cannot be entertained. Section 9 contains various interim measures 
such as appointment of a guardian for a minor or a person of unsound mind for the 
purpose of arbitral proceedings or taking measures for protection of assets, issue of 
interim injunctions or appointment of a receiver etc. In a case, petitioner contractor 
entered into an agreement to execute work of building construction. The work could 
not be completed within time as stipulated in the agreement. Therefore, the petitioner 
sought injunction restraining respondents from getting construction work executed by 
other agency or contractors. Delhi High Court held that such building contract can not 
be specifically enforced by in favour of petitioner granting interim relief under Section 
9 of the Act (See BSM Contractors Pvt. Ltd. v. Rajasthan State Bridge and 
Construction Corporation Ltd. and another, AIR 1999 Delhi 117). 
The order of the Court is appealable under Section 37 of the Act of 1996. 
Appeals 
Section 37 of the Act provides that an appeal shall lie from the following orders 
(and from no others) to the court authorised by law to hear appeals from original 
decrees of the court passing the order, namely; 
 
(a) granting or refusing to grant any measures under Section 9; 
 
(b) setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under Section 34. 
An appeal may also lie against the decision of the arbitral tribunal (a) accepting 
the plea referred in Sub-section (2) or Sub-section (3) of Section 16 or (b) under 
Section 17 of the Act relating to granting or refusing to grant any interim measures. 
[Section 37(2)] 
Section 37(3) prohibits making of second appeal from an order passed in appeal 
under Section 37(1) and (2) of the Act but the right to appeal to the Supreme Court is 
always open to a party aggrieved. The Supreme Court may in its discretion grant 
special leave to appeal where the needs of justice demand an interference by the 
highest court of the land. The power conferred upon the Supreme Court is a 
EP-GCL-3 
132 
residuary and extraordinary. However, it shall be exercised by the Court in 
accordance with the well-established judicial principles or the well established norms 
of procedure which have been recognised for long as precedents. 
7. ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN ARBITRAL AWARDS 
Chapters I and II of Part II of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 deal with 
the enforcement of certain foreign awards made under the New York Convention and 
the Geneva Convention, respectively. Sections 44 and 53 of the Act define the 
foreign awards as to mean an arbitral award on differences between persons arising 
out of legal relationship, whether contractual or not, considered commercial under the 
law in force in India made on or after the 11th day of October 1960 in the case of New 
York Convention awards and after the 28th day of July 1924 in the case of Geneva 
Convention awards. 
8. AWARDS MADE UNDER NEW YORK CONVENTION OR GENEVA 
CONVENTION 
Any foreign award whether made under New York Convention or Geneva 
Convention, which would be enforceable under the Act have been treated as binding 
for all purposes on the persons as between whom it was made, and may accordingly 
be relied on by any of those persons by way of defence, set off or otherwise in any 
legal proceedings in India. 
Conditions for Enforcement of Foreign Awards 
Section 57 of the Act enumerates the conditions for enforcement of foreign 
awards and provides that the party, against whom the award is invoked, may use any 
of the following grounds as defence before the Court for the purpose of refusal of 
enforcement of the foreign awards, namely: 
 
(i) the parties were under some incapacity under the law applicable to them or 
the arbitration agreement is not valid under that law; or 
 
(ii) the party against whom the award is invoked was not given proper notice of 
the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was 
otherwise unable to present his case; or 
 
(iii) the award deals with a difference not falling within the terms of submission 
to arbitration. However, if the award can be separated, the decision on the 
matters beyond the scope of the arbitration agreement shall not be enforced; 
or 
 
(iv) the composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in 
accordance with the agreement of the parties or in the law of the country 
where the arbitration took place; or 
 
(v) the award has not yet become binding, or has been set aside or suspended 
by a competent authority of the country in which or under the law of which, 
the award was made; or 
 
(vi) the subject-matter of the difference is not capable of settlement by 
arbitration under the law of India; or 
 (vii) the enforcement of award would be contrary to the public policy of India. In 
this context, it has been clarified that an award is in conflict with the public 
policy of India if the making of the award is induced or effected by fraud or 
corruption. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
133 
The provisions regarding conditions for enforcement of foreign awards made 
under the New York Convention or the Geneva Convention are almost the same. It is 
obligatory on the party applying for the enforcement of a foreign award to produce 
before the Court: 
 
(a) the original award or a duly authenticated copy thereof; 
 
(b) the original agreement for arbitration or a duly-certified copy thereof; and 
 
(c) such evidence as may be necessary to prove that the award is a foreign 
award. 
Where the award or agreement is in a foreign language, the party seeking to 
enforce the award is required to produce a certified translated copy in English. Where 
the Court is satisfied that the foreign award is enforceable, the award shall be 
deemed to be a decree of that Court. 
Appealable Orders 
An appeal to the Court authorized by law to hear appeals from such order, may 
lie on the following two counts: 
 
(i) Where the judicial authority in India has ordered refusing to refer the parties 
to arbitration under Section 45 in case the New York Convention is 
applicable to them under Section 54 in case the Geneva Convention is 
applicable to them. 
 
 The aforesaid sections i.e. Section 45 and Section 54 provide that a judicial 
authority, when seized of an action in a matter in respect of which the parties 
have made an agreement referred in Section 44 or Section 53, shall, at the 
request of one of the parties or any person claiming through or under him, 
refer the parties to arbitration, unless it finds that the said agreement is null 
and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed. 
 
(ii) Where the Court has refused to enforce a foreign award either under 
Section 48 or Section 57 of the Act. 
 
 Section 50(2) prohibits a second appeal from an order passed in appeal. 
However, any right of the parties to appeal to the Supreme Court shall not 
be affected or taken away by virtue of these provisions. 
 
 Both the Chapters of Part II dealing with New York Convention awards and 
Geneva Convention awards contain a similar saving provision which 
provides that nothing in this chapter shall prejudice any rights which any 
person would have had of enforcing in India of any award or of availing 
himself in India of any award if this chapter had not been enacted. 
9. CONCILIATION 
Conciliation is an informal process in which the conciliator (the third 
party) tries to bring the disputants to agreement. He does this by 
lowering tensions, improving communications, interpreting issues, 
providing technical assistance, exploring potential solutions and 
bringing about a negotiated settlement. Mediation is a structured process in which the 
mediator assists the disputants to reach a negotiated settlement of their differences. 
Mediation is usually a voluntary process that results in a signed agreement which 
EP-GCL-3 
134 
defines the future behaviour of the parties. The mediator uses a variety of skills and 
techniques to help the parties reach the settlement, but is not empowered to render a 
decision. 
Basically, these processes can be successful only if the personality of the 
conciliator or the mediator is such that he is able to induce the parties to come to a 
settlement. The Act gives a formal recognition to conciliation in India. Conciliation 
forces earlier and greater hold of the case. It can succeed only if the parties are 
willing to re-adjust. According to current thinking conciliation is not an alternative to 
arbitration or litigation, but rather complements arbitration or litigation. 
Differences between Arbitration and Conciliation 
Arbitration and conciliation differ in some major ways: 
 
— In arbitration, the decision is known as arbitral award and is signed by the 
arbitral tribunal members; while under conciliation, it is known as 
settlement and is signed by the parties concerned. 
 
— In arbitration, parties cannot appoint even number of arbitrators; while in 
conciliation, the number of conciliators can be even. 
Arbitrators can be appointed even before the dispute arises; while a conciliator is 
appointed only after the dispute has arisen. 
Provisions relating to conciliation 
Under the old law, there are no special provisions to deal with the award based 
on compromise. As against, the new law facilitates the arbitrator to promote efforts to 
arrive at settlement of dispute through conciliation. 
Part III of the Act contains following provisions in this regard. 
Application and scope of conciliation 
(1) Save as otherwise provided by any law for the time being in force and unless 
the parties have otherwise agreed, this Part shall apply to conciliation of disputes 
arising out of legal relationship, whether contractural or not and to all proceedings 
relating thereto. 
(2) This Part shall not apply where by virtue of any law for the time being in force 
certain disputes may not be submitted to conciliation. (Section 61) 
Commencement of conciliation proceedings 
(1) The party initiating conciliation shall send to the other party a written 
invitation to conciliate under this Part, briefly identifying the subject of the dispute. 
(2) Conciliation proceedings shall commence when the other party accepts in 
writing the invitation to conciliate. 
(3) If the other party rejects the invitation there will be no conciliation 
proceedings. 
(4) If the party initiating conciliation does not receive a reply within thirty days 
from the date on which he sends the invitation, or within such other period of time as 
specified in the invitation he may elect to treat this as a rejection of the invitation to 
conciliate and if he so elects, he shall inform in writing the other party accordingly.

(1) The conciliator shall assist the parties in an independent and impartial manner 
in their attempt to reach an amicable settlement of their dispute. 
(2) The conciliator shall be guided by principles of objectivity, fairness and 
justice, giving consideration to, among other things, the rights and obligations of the 
parties, the usages of the trade concerned and the circumstances surrounding the 
dispute, including any previous business practices between the parties. 
(3) The conciliator may conduct the conciliation proceedings in such a manner as 
he considers appropriate, taking into account the circumstances of the case, the 
wishes the parties may express, including any request by a party that the conciliator 
hear oral statements, and the need for a speedy settlement of the dispute. 
(4) The conciliator may, at any stage of the conciliation proceedings, make 
proposals for a settlement of the dispute. Such proposals need not be in writing and 
need not be accompanied by a statement of the reasons therefor. (Section 67)

When the conciliator receives factual information concerning the dispute from a 
party, he shall disclose the substance of that information to the other party in order 
that the other party may have the opportunity to present any explanation which he

Provided that when a party gives any information to the conciliator subject to a 
specific condition that it be kept confidential, the conciliator shall not disclose that 
information to the other party. (Section 70) 
Co-operation of parties with Conciliator 
The parties shall in good faith co-operate with the conciliator and, in particular, 
shall endeavour to comply with requests by the conciliator to submit written materials, 
provide evidence and attend meetings. (Section 71) 
 
 
EP-GCL-3

Suggestions by parties for settlement of dispute 
Each party may, on his own initiative or at the invitation of the conciliator, submit 
to the conciliator suggestions for the settlement of the dispute. (Section 72) 
Settlement agreement 
(1) When it appears to the conciliator that there exists elements of a settlement 
which may be acceptable to the parties, he shall formulate the terms of a possible

sanctity of an arbitral award under Section 74 of the Act (Haresh Dayaram Thakur v. 
State of Maharashtra, AIR 2000 SC 2281). 
Confidentiality 
Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force,

appointed, to the effect that the conciliation proceedings are terminated, on 
the date of the declaration. (Section 76) 
Resort to arbitral or judicial proceedings 
The parties shall not initiate, during the conciliation proceedings, any arbitral or 
judicial proceedings in respect of a dispute that is the subject matter of the 
conciliation proceedings except that a party may initiate arbitral or judicial 
proceedings where, in his opinion, such proceedings are necessary for preserving his 
rights. (Section 77) 
Costs 
(1) Upon termination of the conciliation proceedings, the conciliator shall fix the 
costs of the conciliation and give written notice thereof to the parties. 
(2) For the purpose of Sub-section (1), ―costs‖ means reasonable costs relating

10. ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) 
There is a growing awareness that courts will not be in a position to bear the 
entire burden of justice system. A very large number of disputes lend themselves to 
resolution by alternative modes such as arbitration, mediation, conciliation, 
negotiation, etc. The ADR processes provide procedural flexibility save valuable time 
and money and avoid the stress of a conventional trial. 
At present, ADR services are offered in India in very rudimentary form. There is, 
therefore, an urgent need to establish and promote ADR services for resolution of 
EP-GCL-3 
140 
both domestic and international disputes in India. These services need to be 
nourished 
on 
sound 
conceptions, 
expertise 
in 
their 
implementation 
and 
comprehensive and modern facilities. 
The International Centre for Alternative Dispute Resolution (ICADR) is a unique 
centre in this part of the world that makes provision for promoting teaching and 
research in the field of ADR as also for offering ADR services to parties not only in 
India but also to parties all over the world. The ICADR is a Society registered under 
Societies Registration Act, 1860, it is an independent non-profit making organisation. 
It maintains panels of independent experts in the implementation of ADR processes. 
Areas in which ADR works 
Almost all disputes including commercial, civil, labour and family disputes, in 
respect of which the parties are entitled to conclude a settlement, can be settled by 
an ADR procedure. ADR techniques have been proven to work in the business 
environment, especially in respect of disputes involving joint ventures, construction 
projects, partnership differences, intellectual property, personal injury, product 
liability, professional liability, real estate, securities, contract interpretation and 
performance and insurance coverage. 
III.  LAW RELATING TO TORTS 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
The word ‗tort‘ is a French equivalent of English word ‗wrong‘. The word tort is 
derived from Latin language from the word Tortum. Thus, simply stated ‗tort‘ means 
wrong. But every wrong or wrongful act is not a tort. Tort is really a kind of civil wrong 
as opposed to criminal wrong. Wrongs, in law, are either public or private. 
Broadly speaking, public wrongs are the violations of ‗public law and hence 
amount to be offences against the State, while private wrongs are the breaches of 
private law, i.e., wrongs against individuals. Public wrongs or crimes are those 
wrongs which are made punishable under the penal law which belong to the public 
law group. 
Section 2(m) of the Limitation Act, 1963, states: ―Tort means a civil wrong which 
is not exclusively a breach of contract or breach of trust.‖ 
Salmond defines it as ‖a civil wrong for which the remedy is a common law action 
for unliquidated damages and which is not exclusively the breach of a contract or the 
breach of a trust or other merely equitable obligation.‖ 
Fraser describes it as ―an infringement of a right in rem of a private individual 
giving a right of compensation at the suit of the injured party.‖ 
Winfield says : ―Tortious liability arises from the breach of duty, primarily fixed by 
law; this duty is towards persons generally and its breach is redressable by an action 
for unliquidated damages‖. 
Two important elements can be derived from all these definitions, namely: (i) that 
a tort is a species of civil injury of wrong as opposed to a criminal wrong, and (ii) that 
every civil wrong is not a tort. Accordingly, it is now possible to distinguish tort from a 
crime and from a contract, a trust and a quasi-contract. The distinction between civil 
and criminal wrongs depends on the nature of the appropriate remedy provided by 
law. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3

2. GENERAL CONDITIONS OF LIABILITY FOR A TORT 
As stated earlier, there is no fixed catalogue of circumstances, which along and 
for all time mark the limit of what are torts. Certain situations have been held to be 
torts and will continue to be so in the absence of statutory repeal, and others have 
been held not to be torts. However, certain general conditions for tortuous liability can 
be laid down. 
In general, a tort consists of some act or omission done by the defendant 
(tortfeasor) whereby he has without just cause or excuse caused some harm to 
plaintiff. To constitute a tort, there must be: 
 
(i) a wrongful act or omission of the defendant; 
 
(ii) the wrongful act must result in causing legal damage to another; and 
 
(iii) the wrongful act must be of such a nature as to give rise to a legal remedy. 
(i) Wrongful act: The act complained of, should under the circumstances, be 
legally wrongful as regards the party complaining. In other words, it should 
prejudicially affect any of the above mentioned interests, and protected by law. Thus, 
every person whose legal rights, e.g., right of reputation, right of bodily safety and 
freedom, and right to property are violated without legal excuse, has a right of action 
against the person who violated them, whether loss results from such violation or not. 
(ii) Legal damages: it is not every damage that is a damage in the eye of the law. 
It must be a damage which the law recognizes as such. In other words, there should 
be legal injury or invasion of the legal right. In the absence of an infringement of a 
legal right, an action does not lie. Also, where there is infringement of a legal right, an 
action lies even though no damage may have been caused.  
As was stated in Ashby v. White, (1703) 2 Ld. Raym. 938 legal 
damage is neither identical with actual damage nor is it 
necessarily pecuniary. Two maxims, namely : (i) Damnum sine 
injuria, and (ii) injuria sine damnum, explain this proposition. 
Damnum Sine Injuria 
Damnum means harm, loss or damage in respect of money, comfort, health, etc. 
Injuria means infringement of a right conferred by law on the plaintiff. The maxim 
means that in a given case, a man may have suffered damage and yet have no 
action in tort, because the damage is not to an interest protected by the law of torts. 
Therefore, causing damage, however substantial to another person is not actionable 
in law unless there is also a violation of a legal right of the plaintiff. Common 
examples are, where the damage results from an act done in the exercise of legal 
rights. Thus, if I own a shop and you open a shop in the neighbourhood, as a 
result of which I lose some customers and my profits fall off, I cannot sue you 
for the lose in profits, because you are exercising your legal right. [Gloucester 
Grammer School case, (1410) Y.B. Hill. 11 Hen, 4, of. 47, pp. 21,36] 
Injuria Sine Damno 
It means injury without damage, i.e., where there is no damage resulted yet it is 
EP-GCL-3 
142 
? 
an injury or wrong in tort, i.e. where there is infringement of a legal right not resulting 
in harm but plaintiff can still sue in tort. 
Some rights or interests are so important that their violation is an actionable tort 
without proof of damage. Thus when there is an invasion of an ―absolute‖ private right 
of an individual, there is an injuria and the plaintiff‘s action will succeed even if there 
is no Damnum or damages. In simple terms, it means that if some one else‘s legal 
rights are infringed upon, it is actionable, even if no damage has resulted to the other 
person.  The leading example is the case of Ashby v White referred to above where a 
person was wrongfully not allowed to vote and even though it has not caused him any 
damage, since his legal right to vote was denied, he was entitled to compensation. 
An absolute right is one, the violation of which is actionable per se, i.e., without the 
proof of any damage. Injuria sine damno covers such cases and action lies when the 
right is violated even though no damage has occurred. Thus the act of trespassing 
upon another‘s land is actionable even though it has not caused the plaintiff even the 
slightest harm. 
(iii) Legal remedy: The third condition of liability for a tort is legal remedy. This 
means that to constitute a tort, the wrongful act must come under the law. The main 
remedy for a tort is an action for unliquidated damages, although some other 
remedies, e.g., injunction, may be obtained in addition to damages or specific 
restitution may be claimed in an action for the detention of a chattel. Self-help is a 
remedy of which the injured party can avail himself without going to a law court. It 
does not apply to all torts and perhaps the best example of these to which it does 
apply is trespass to land. For example, if ―A‖ finds a drunken stranger in his room who 
has no business to be there in it, and is thus a trespass, he (A) is entitled to get rid of 
him, if possible without force but if that be not possible with such force as the 
circumstances of the case may warrant. 
Mens Rea 
How far a guilty mind of persons is required for liability for tort? 
The General principle lies in the maxim ―actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea‖ 
i.e. the act itself creates no guilt in the absence of a guilty mind. It does not mean that 
for the law or Torts, the act must be done with an evil motive, but simply means that 
mind must concur in the Act, the act must be done either with wrongful intention or 
negligence. For example, under criminal law, mens rea must be proved. However, to 
this principle cases of absolute or strict liability are exceptions.

3. KINDS OF TORTIOUS LIABILITY 
The following types of tortuous liability may be noted: 
(A) STRICT OR ABSOLUTE LIABILITY 
In some torts, the defendant is liable even though the harm to the plaintiff 
occurred without intention or negligence on the defendant‘s part. In other words, the 
defendant is held liable without fault. These cases fall under the following categories: 
(i) Liability for Inevitable Accident – Such liability arises in cases where damage 
is done by the escape of dangerous substances brought or kept by anyone upon his 
land. Such cases are where a man is made by law an insurer of other against the 
result of his activities. 
(ii) Liability for Inevitable Mistake – Such cases are where a person interferes 
with the property or reputation of another. 
(iii) Vicarious Liability for Wrongs committed by others – Responsibility in such 
cases is imputed by law on grounds of social policy or expediency. These case 
involve liability of master for the acts of his servant. 
Rule in Rylands v. Fletcher 
The rule in Rylands v. Flethcer (1868) L.R. 3 H.L. 330 is that a man acts at his 
peril and is the insurer of the safety of his neighbour against accidental harm. 
Such duty is absolute because it is independent of 
negligence on the part of the defendant or his servants. It 
was held in that case that: “If a person brings or 
accumulates on his land anything which, if it should escape 
may cause damage to his neighbours, he does so at his 
own peril. If it does not escape and cause damage he is 
responsible, however careful he may have been, and 
whatever precautions he may have taken to prevent damage.” 
The facts of this case were as follows: B, a mill owner employed independent 
contractors, who were apparently competent to construct a reservoir on his land to 
provide water for his mill. There were old disused mining shafts under the site of the 
reservoir which the contractors failed to observe because they were filled with earth. 
The contractors therefore, did not block them. When the water was filled in the 
reservoir, it bursted through the shafts and flooded the plaintiff‘s coal mines on the 
adjoining land. It was found as a fact that B did not know of the shafts and had not 
been negligent, though the independent contractors, had been, B was held liable. 
Blackburn, J., observed; ―We think that the true rule of law is that the person, who for 
his own purposes brings on his lands and collects and keeps there anything likely to 
do mischief if it escapes, must keep it at his peril and if, he does not do so is, prima 
facie answerable for all the damage which is the natural consequence of its escape.‖ 
Later in the case of Read v. Lyons [(1946) 2 All. E.R. 471 (H.L.)], it has been 
explained that two conditions are necessary in order to apply the rule in Ryland v. 
Fletcher, these are: 
(i) Escape: from a place of which the defendant has occupation or over which he 
has a control to a place which is outside his occupation or control or something likely 
to do mischief if it escapes; and 
EP-GCL-3 
144 
(ii) Non-natural use of Land: The defendant is liable if he makes a non-natural 
use of land. 
If either of these conditions is absent, the rule of strict liability will not apply. 
(a) Exceptions to the Rule of Strict Liability 
The following exceptions to the rule of strict liability have been introduced in 
course of time, some of them being inherent in the judgment itself in Ryland v. 
Fletcher: 
 
(i) Damage due to Natural Use of the Land 
 
 In Ryland v. Fletcher water collected in the reservoir in such large quantity, 
was held to be non-natural use of land. Keeping water for ordinary 
domestic purpose is ‗natural use‘. Things not essentially dangerous which 
is not unusual for a person to have on his own land, such as water pipe 
installations in buildings, the working of mines and minerals on land, the 
lighting of fire in a fire-place of a house, and necessary wiring for supplying 
electric light, fall under the category of ―natural use‖ of land. 
 
(ii) Consent of the plaintiff 
 
 Where the plaintiff has consented to the accumulation of the dangerous 
thing on the defendant‘s land, the liability under the rule in Ryland v. 
Flethcher does not arise. Such a consent is implied where the source of 
danger is for the ‗common benefit‘ of both the plaintiff and the defendant. 
 
(iii) Act of Third Party 
 
 If the harm has been caused due to the act of a stranger, who is neither 
defendant‘s servant nor agent nor the defendant has any control over him, 
the defendant will not be liable. Thus, in Box v. Jubh (1879) 4 Ex. D. 76, 
the overflow from the defendant‘s reservoir was caused by the blocking of 
a drain by stranger, the defendant was held not liable. But if the act of the 
stranger, is or can be foreseen by the defendant and the damage can be 
prevented, the defendant must, by due care prevent the damage. Failure 
on his part to avoid such damage will make him liable. 
 
(iv) Statutory Authority 
 
 Sometimes, public bodies storing water, gas, electricity and the like are by 
statute, exempted from liability so long as they have taken reasonable 
care. This is based on the principle that they act in public interest.  
 
 Thus, in Green v. Chelzea Water Works Co. (1894) 70 L.T. 547 the 
defendant company had a statutory duty to maintain continuous 
supply of water. A main belonging to the company burst without any 
fault on its part as a consequence of which plaintiff’s premises were 
flooded with water. It was held that the company was not liable as the 
company was engaged in performing a statutory duty. 
 
(v) Act of God 
 
 If an escape is caused, through natural causes and without human 
intervention circumstances which no human foresight can provide against 
and of which human prudence is not bound to recognize the possibility, 
there is then said to exist the defence of Act of God. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
145 
? 
 
(vi) Escape due to plaintiff‘s own Default 
 
 Damage by escape due to the plaintiff‘s own default was considered to be 
good defence in Rylands v. Fletcher itself. Also, if the plaintiff suffers 
damage by his own intrusion into the defendant‘s property, he cannot 
complain for the damage so caused. 
Applicability of the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher in cases of enterprises engaged in a 
hazardous or inherently dangerous industry 
The Supreme Court has discussed the applicability of the rule of Reylands v. 
Fletcher in the case of M.C. Mehta v. Union of India and Others (1987) 1. Comp. L.J. 
p. 99 S.C. while determining the principles on which the liability of an enterprise 
engaged in a hazardous or inherently dangerous industry depended if an accident 
occurred in such industry. 
―We have to evolve new principle and lay down new norms which would 
adequately deal with the new problems which arise in a highly industrialized 
economy. We cannot allow our judicial thinking to be constricted by reference to 
the law as it prevails in England or for the matter of that, in any other foreign 
country‖.  
On the question of the nature of liability for a hazardous enterprise the court while 
noting that the above rule as developed in England recognizes certain limitations and 
responsibilities recorded it‘s final view as follows: 
―We are of the view that an enterprise which is engaged in a hazardous or 
inherently dangerous industry which poses a potential threat to the health and 
safety of the persons working in the factory and residing in the surrounding 
areas, owes an absolute and non-delegable duty to the community to ensure that 
no harm results to anyone on account of hazardous or inherently dangerous 
nature of the activity which it has undertaken. The enterprise must be held to be 
under an obligation to provide that the hazardous or inherently dangerous activity 
in which it is engaged, must be conducted with the highest standards of safety; 
and if any harm results on account of such activity, the enterprise must be 
absolutely liable to compensate for such harm; and it should be no answer to the 
enterprise to say that it had taken all reasonable care and that the harm occurred 
without negligence on its part.‖ 
Thus, while imposing absolute liability for manufacture of hazardous substances, 
the Supreme Court intended that the requirement of non-natural use or the aspect of 
escape of a dangerous substance, commonly regarded as essential for liability under 
Rylands v. Fletcher, need not be proved in India. 
 
Test your knowledge 
Which of the following are different kinds of strict or absolute liability? 
 
(a) Liability for inevitable accident 
 
(b) Liability for evitable accident 
 
(c) Liability for inevitable mistake 
 
(d) Vicarious liability for wrongs committed by others. 
Correct answer: (a), (c) and (d) 
EP-GCL-3 
146 
(B) VICARIOUS LIABILITY 
Normally, the tortfeasor is liable for his tort. But in some cases a person may be 
held liable for the tort committed by another. A master is vicariously liable for the tort 
of his servant, principal for the tort of his agent and partners for the tort of a partner. 
This is know as vicarious liability in tort. The common examples of such a liability are: 
(a) Principal and Agent [Specific authority] 
Qui facit per alium facit per se – he who acts through another is acting himself, so 
that the act of the agent is the act of the principal. When an agent commits a tort in 
the ordinary course of his duties as an agent, the principal is liable for the same. In 
Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Co. (1912) A.C. 716, the managing clerk of a firm of 
solicitors, while acting in the ordinary course of business committed fraud, 
against a lady client by fraudulently inducing her to sign documents 
transferring her property to him. He had done so without the knowledge of his 
principal who was liable because the fraud was committed in the course of 
employment. 
(b) Partners 
For the tort committed by a partner in the ordinary course of the business of the 
firm, all the other partners are liable therefore to the same extent as the guilty partner. 
The liability of the partners is joint and several. In Hamlyn v. Houston & Co. (1903) 
1 K.B. 81, one of the two partners bribed the plaintiff’s clerk and induced him to 
divulge secrets relating to his employer’s business. It was held that both the 
partners were liable for the tort committed by only one of them. 
(c) Master and Servant [Authority by relation] 
A master is liable for the tort committed by his servant while acting in the course 
of his employment. The servant, of course, is also liable; their liability is joint and 
several. 
In such cases (1) liability of a person is independent of his own wrongful intention 
or negligence (2) liability is joint as well several (3) In case of vicarious liability the 
liability arises because of the relationship between the principal and the wrongdoer 
but in case of absolute or strict liability the liability arises out of the wrong itself. 
A master is liable not only for the acts which have been committed by the 
servant, but also for acts done by him which are not specifically authorized, in the 
course of his employment. The basis of the rule has been variously stated: on the 
maxim Respondeat Superior (Let the principal be liable) or on the maxim Qui facit per 
alium facit per se (he who does an act through another is deemed to do it himself). 
The master is liable even though the servant acted against the express 
instructions, for the benefit of his master, so long as the servant acted in the course 
of employment. 
(d) Employer and Independent Contractor 
It is to be remembered that an employer is vicariously liable for the torts of his 
servants committed in the course of their employment, but he is not liable for the torts 
of those who are his independent contractors. 
A servant is a person who is employed by another (the employer) to perform 
services in connection with the affairs of the employer, and over whom the employer 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
147 
has control in the performance of these services. An independent contractor is one 
who works for another but who is not controlled by that other in his conduct in the 
performance of that work. These definitions show that a person is a servant where 
the employer ―retains the control of the actual performance‖ of the work. 
(e) Where Employer is Liable for the acts of Independent Contractor 
The employer is not liable merely because an independent contractor commits a 
tort in the course of his employment; the employer is liable only if he himself is 
deemed to have committed a tort. This may happen in one of the following three 
ways: 
 
(i) When employer authorizes him to commit a tort. 
 
(ii) In torts of strict liability 
 
(iii) Negligence of independent contractor 
(f) Where Employer is not Liable for the acts of an Independent Contractor 
An employer is not liable for the tort of an independent contractor if he has taken 
care in the appointment of the contractor. In Philips v. Britania Hygienic Laundry 
Co. (1923), the owner of lorry was held not liable when a third-party’s vehicle 
was damaged, in consequence of the negligent repair of his lorry by a garage 
proprietor. 
Employers of independent contractors are liable for the ―collateral negligence‖ of 
their contractors in the course of his employment. Where A employed B to fit 
casement windows into certain premises. B‘s servant negligently put a tool on the still 
of the window on which he was working at the time. The wind blew the casement 
open and the tool was knocked off the still on to a passer by. The employer was held 
to be liable, because the harm was caused by the work on a highway and duty lies 
upon the employer to avoid harm. 
(g) Liability for the acts of Servants 
An employer is liable whenever his servant commits a tort in the course of his 
employment. An act is deemed to be done in the course of employment if it is either: 
 
(i) a wrongful act authorized by the employer, or 
 
(ii) a wrongful and unauthorized mode of doing some act authorized by the 
employer. 
So for as the first alternative is concerned there is no difficulty in holding the 
master liable for the tort of his servant. A few examples, however, are necessary to 
explain the working of the rule in the second. These are as follows: 
In Century Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Northern Ireland Road Transport Board (1942) 
A.C. 509, the director of a petrol lorry, while transferring petrol from the lorry to an 
underground tank at a garage, struck a match in order to light a cigarette and then 
threw it, still alight on the floor. An explosion and a fire ensued. The House of Lords 
held his employers liable for the damage caused, for he did the act in the course of 
carrying out his task of delivering petrol; it was an unauthorized way of doing what he 
was employed to do. 
EP-GCL-3 
148 
? 
Similarly, in Bayley v. Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Rly. Co. (1873) 
L.R. 7 C.P. 415, erroneously thinking that the plaintiff was in the wrong train, a porter 
of the defendants forcibly removed him. The defendants were held liable. 
(C) VICARIOUS LIABILITY OF THE STATE 
(a) The Position in England 
At Common Law the Crown could not be sued in tort, either for wrongs actually 
authorized by it or committed by its servants, in the course of their employment. With 
the passing of the Crown Proceeding Act, 1947, the Crown is liable for the torts 
committed by its servants just like a private individual. Thus, in England, the Crown is 
now vicariously liable for the torts of its servants. 
(b) The Position in India 
Unlike the Crown Proceeding Act, 1947 of England, we have no statutory 
provision with respect to the liability of the State in India. 
When a case of Government liability in tort comes before the courts, the question 
is whether the particular Government activity, which gave rise to the tort, was the 
sovereign function or non-sovereign function. If it is a sovereign function, it could 
claim immunity from the tortuous liability, otherwise not. A sovereign function denotes 
the activity of the State which can be done only by the State like defence, police, etc. 
The State is not liable vicariously for any breach by its employees. A non sovereign 
function covers generally the activities of commercial nature or those which can be 
carried out by a private individual like transport, hospitals etc. in which the State is 
equally liable similar to a private person.

Which of the following are common examples of vicarious liability? 
 
(a) Principal and agent  
 
(b) Partners 
 
(c) Master and servant  
 
(d) Employer and employed contractor 
Correct answer: (a), (b) and (c) 
 
4. TORTS OR WRONGS TO PERSONAL SAFETY AND FREEDOM 
An action for damages lies in the following kinds of wrongs which are styled as 
injuries to the person of an individual: 
(a) Battery 
Any direct application of force to the person of another individual 
without his consent or lawful justification is a wrong of battery. To 
constitute a tort of battery, therefore, two things are necessary: (i) use 
of force, however, trivial it may be without the plaintiff‘s consent, and 
(ii) without any lawful justification. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
149 
Even though the force used is very trivial and does not cause any harm, the 
wrong is committed. Thus, even to touch a person in anger or without any lawful 
justification is battery. 
(b) Assault 
Assault is any act of the defendant which directly causes the plaintiff 
immediately to apprehend a contact with his person. Thus, when the 
defendant by his act creates an apprehension in the mind of the 
plaintiff that he is going to commit battery against him, the tort of 
assault is committed. The law of assault is substantially the same as that of battery 
except that apprehension of contact, not the contact itself has to be established. 
Usually when there is a battery, there will also be assault, but not for instance, when 
a person is hit from behind. To point a loaded gun at the plaintiff, or to shake fist 
under his nose, or to curse him in a threatening manner, or to aim a blow at him 
which is intercepted, or to surround him with a display of force is to assault him 
clearly if the defendant by his act intends to commit a battery and the plaintiff 
apprehends it, is an assault. 
(c) Bodily Harm 
A willful act (or statement) of defendant, calculated to cause physical harm to the 
plaintiff and in fact causing physical harm to him, is a tort. 
(d) False Imprisonment 
False imprisonment consists in the imposition of a total restraint for 
some period, however short, upon the liberty of another, without 
sufficient lawful justification. It means unauthorized restraint on a 
person‘s body. What happens in false imprisonment is that a person is 
confined within certain limits so that he cannot move about and so his personal liberty 
is infringed. It is a serious violation of a person‘s right and liberty whether being 
confined within the four walls or by being prevented from leaving place where he is. If 
a man is restrained, by a threat of force from leaving his own house or an open field 
there is false imprisonment. 
(e) Malicious Prosecution 
Malicious prosecution consists in instigating judicial proceedings (usually 
criminal) against another, maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause, 
which terminate in favour of that other and which results in damage to his reputation, 
personal freedom or property. 
The following are the essential elements of this tort: 
 
(i) There must have been a prosecution of the plaintiff by the 
defendant. 
 
(ii) There must have been want of reasonable and probable 
cause for that prosecution. 
 
(iii) The defendant must have acted maliciously (i.e. with an improper motive 
and not to further the end of justice). 
 
(iv) The plaintiff must have suffered damages as a result of the prosecution. 
 
(v) The prosecution must have terminated in favour of the plaintiff. 
EP-GCL-3 
150 
To be actionable, the proceedings must have been instigated actually by the 
defendant. If he merely states the fact as he believes them to a policeman or a 
magistrate he is not responsible for any proceedings which might ensue as a result of 
action by such policeman or magistrate on his/her own initiative. 
This is because there is no malice involved in it.  Malicious prosecution thus 
actually refers to the case of initial prosecution with malice and as a remedy for it, the 
other party who had won the case, may institute, under the law of torts, a suit for 
malicious prosecution. 
(f) Nervous Shock 
This branch of law is comparatively of recent origin. It provides relief when a 
person may get physical injury not by an impact, e.g., by stick, bullet or sword but 
merely by the nervous shock through what he has seen or heard. Causing of nervous 
shock itself is not enough to make it an actionable tort, some injury or illness must 
take place as a result of the emotional disturbance, fear or sorrow. 
(g) Defamation 
Defamation is an attack on the reputation of a person. It means that something is 
said or done by a person which affects the reputation of another. It is defined as 
follows: 
―Defamation is the publication of a statement which tends to lower a 
person in the estimation of right thinking members of society 
generally; or which tends to make them shun or avoid that person.‖ 
Defamation may be classified into two heads: Libel and Slander. Libel is a 
representation made in some permanent form, e.g. written words, pictures, caricatures, 
cinema films, effigy, statue and recorded words. In a cinema films both the 
photographic part of it and the speech which is synchronized with it amount to tort. 
Slander is the publication of a defamatory statement in a transient form; 
statement of temporary nature such as spoken words, or gestures. 
Generally, the punishment for libel is more severe than for slander. 
Defamation is tort as well as a crime in India. 
In India both libel and slander are treated as a crime. Section 499 of the Indian 
Penal Code recognizes both libel and slander as an offence. However, torts in 
criminal law are stricter than in law of tort. 
5. REMEDIES IN TORTS 
(1) Judicial Remedies 
Three types of judicial remedies are available to the plaintiff in an action for tort 
namely: (i) Damages or Compensation, (ii) Injunction, and (iii) Specific Restitution of 
Property. 
Extra Judicial Remedies 
In certain cases it is lawful to redress one‘s injuries by means of self help without 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
151 
? 
recourse to the court. These remedies are: 
(a) Self Defence 
It is lawful for any person to use reasonable forces to protect himself, or any 
other person against any unlawful use of force. 
(b) Prevention of Trespass 
An occupier of land or any person with his authority may use reasonable force to 
prevent trespassers entering or to eject them but the force should be reasonable for 
the purpose. 
(c) Re-entry on Land 
A person wrongfully disposed of land may retake possession of land if he can do 
so in a peaceful and reasonable manner. 
(d) Re-caption of Goods 
It is neither a crime nor a tort for a person entitled to possession of a chattel to 
take it either peacefully or by the use of a reasonable force from one who has 
wrongly taken it or wrongfully detained it. 
(e) Abatement of Nuisance 
The occupier of land may lawfully abate (i.e. terminate by his own act), any 
nuisance injuriously affecting it. Thus, he may cut overhanging branches as 
spreading roots from his neighbour‘s trees, but (i) upon giving notice; (ii) by choosing 
the least mischievous method; (iii) avoiding unnecessary damage. 
(f) Distress Damage Feasant 
An occupier may lawfully seize any cattle or any chattel which are unlawfully on 
his land doing damage there and detain them until compensation is paid for the 
damage. The right is known as that of distress damage feasant-to distrain things 
which are doing damage. It is a legal seizure and detention of cattle or chattel till 
compensation is paid for the damage.

IV.  LAW RELATING TO LIMITATION 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
The law relating to limitation is incorporated in the Limitation Act of 1963, which 
prescribes different periods of limitation for suits, petitions or applications. 
EP-GCL-3 
152 
? 
The Act applies to all civil proceedings and some special criminal proceedings 
which can be taken in a Court of law unless its application is excluded by any 
enactment. The Act extends to whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir. 
Limitation Bars Remedy, But Does Not Extinguish Rights 
The Law of limitation bars the remedy in a Court of law only when the 
period of limitation has expired, but it does not extinguish the right that it 
cannot be enforced by judicial process (Bombay Dying & Mfg. Co. Ltd. v. State of 
Bombay, AIR 1958 SC 328). Thus if a claim is satisfied outside the Court of law after 
the expiry of period of limitation, that is not illegal as the right to cause of action 
always remains. Similarly, even if the defence of limitation is not set by the other 
party, the Court cannot accept any suit, appeal or application beyond the period of 
limitation.  
2. COMPUTATION OF THE PERIOD OF LIMITATION FOR DIFFERENT TYPES 
OF SUITS 
The Courts in India are bound by the specific provisions of the Limitation Act and 
are not permitted to move outside the ambit of these provisions. The Act prescribes 
the period of limitation in Articles in Schedule to the Act. In the Articles of the 
Schedule to the Limitation Act, Columns 1, 2, and 3 must be read together to give 
harmonious meaning and construction. 
The Schedule containing the table showing the relevant Articles prescribing 
limitation period for a specified suit and also time from which such period commences 
is given at the end of this Lesson. 
3. BAR OF LIMITATION 
Section 3 of the Act provides that any suit, appeal or application if made beyond 
the prescribed period of limitation, it is the duty of the Court not to proceed with such 
suits irrespective of the fact whether the plea of limitation has been set up in defence 
or not. The provisions of Section 3 are mandatory. The Court can suo motu take note 
of question of limitation. The question whether a suit is barred by limitation should be 
decided on the facts as they stood on the date of presentation of the plaint. It is a vital 
section upon which the whole limitation Act depends for its efficacy. 
The effect of Section 3 is not to deprive the Court of its jurisdiction. Therefore, 
decision of a Court allowing a suit which had been instituted after the period 
prescribed is not vitiated for want of jurisdiction. A decree passed in a time barred suit 
is not a nullity.

4. EXTENSION OF TIME IN CERTAIN CASES 
Doctrine of sufficient cause 
Section 5 allows the extension of prescribed period in certain cases on sufficient 
cause being shown for the delay. This is known as doctrine of ―sufficient cause‖ for 
condonation of delay which is embodied in Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963. 
Section 5 provides that any appeal or any application, other than an application under 
any of the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, may be 
admitted after the prescribed period if the appellant or the applicant satisfies the court 
that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the application 
within such period. 
It is clarified by the explanation appended to the Section 5 that the fact that the 
appellant or applicant was misled by any order, practice or judgement of the High 
Court in ascertaining or computing the prescribed period may be a sufficient cause 
within the meaning of this section. 
Thus, the Court may admit an application or appeal even after the expiry of the 
specified period of limitation if it is satisfied with the applicant or the appellant, as the 
case may be as to sufficient cause for not making it within time. 
The Section is not applicable to applications made under any of the provisions of 
Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and also to suits. The Court has no 
power to admit a time barred suit even if there is a sufficient cause for the delay. It 
applies only to appeals or applications as specified therein. The reason for non-
applicability of the Section to suits is that, the period of limitation allowed in most of the 
suits extends from 3 to 12 years whereas in appeals and application it does not exceed 
6 months. For the applicability of Section 5, the ―prescribed period‖ should be over. The 
prescribed period means any period prescribed by any law for the time being in force. 
The party applying for condonation of delay should satisfy the Court for not 
making an appeal or application within the prescribed period for sufficient cause. The 
term sufficient cause has not been defined in the Limitation Act. It depends on the 
circumstances of each case.  
However, it must be a cause which is beyond the control of the party.  In Ramlal 
v. Rewa Coal Fields Ltd., AIR 1962 SC 361, the Supreme Court held that once the 
period of limitation expires then the appellant has to explain the delay made 
thereafter for day by day and if he is unable to explain the delay even for a single 
day, it would be deemed that the party did not have sufficient cause for delay. 
It is the Court‘s discretion to extend or not to extend the period of limitation even 
after the sufficient cause has been shown and other conditions are also specified. 
However, the Court should exercise its discretion judicially and not arbitrarily. 
What is sufficient cause and what is not may be explained by the 
following Judicial observations: 
 
1. Wrong practice of High Court which misled the appellant or 
his counsel in not filing the appeal should be regarded as sufficient 
cause under Section 5; 
 
2. In certain cases, mistake of counsel may be taken into consideration in 
condonation of delay. But such mistake must be bona fide; 
EP-GCL-3 
154 
 
3. Wrong advice given by advocate can give rise to sufficient cause in certain 
cases; 
 
4. Mistake of law in establishing or exercising the right given by law may be 
considered as sufficient cause. However, ignorance of law is not excuse, nor 
the negligence of the party or the legal adviser constitutes a sufficient cause; 
 
5. Imprisonment of the party or serious illness of the party may be considered 
for condonation of delay; 
 
6. Time taken for obtaining certified copies of the decree of the judgment 
necessary to accompany the appeal or application was considered for 
condoning the delay. 
 
7. Non-availability of the file of the case to the State counsel or Panel lawyer is 
no ground for condonation of inordinate delay (Collector and Authorised 
Chief Settlement Commissioner v. Darshan Singh and others, AIR 1999 Raj. 
84). 
 
8. Ailment of father during which period the defendant was looking after him 
has been held to be a sufficient and genuine cause (Mahendra Yadav v. 
Ratna Devi & others, AIR 2006 (NOC) 339 Pat. 
The test of “sufficient course” is purely an individualistic test.  It is not an 
objective test.  Therefore,  no two cases can be treated alike.  
The statute of limitation has left the concept of sufficient 
cause’ delightfully undefined thereby leaving to the court a 
well-intended discretion to decide  the individual cases 
whether circumstances exist establishing sufficient cause.  
There are no categories of sufficient cause.  The categories 
of sufficient cause are never exhausted.  Each case spells 
out a unique experience to be dealt with by the Court as such. [R B Ramlingam 
v. R B Bhvansewari (2009) 2 SCC 689.] 
The quasi-judicial tribunals, labour courts or executive authorities have no power 
to extend the period under this Section. 
There are no categories of sufficient cause. The categories of 
sufficient cause are never exhausted. Each case spells out a 
unique experience to be dealt with by the court as such. 
Persons under legal disability 
Section 6 is an enabling section to enable persons under disability to exercise 
their legal rights within a certain time. Section 7 supplements Section 6, Section 8 
controls these sections, which serves as an exception to Sections 6 and 7. The 
combined effect of Sections 6 and 8 is that where the prescribed period of limitation 
expires before the cessation of disability, for instance, before the attainment of 
majority, the minor will no doubt be entitled to a fresh period of limitation from the 
attainment of his majority subject to the condition that in no case the period extended 
by Section 6 shall by virtue of Section 8 exceeds three years from cessation of 
disability, i.e. attainment of majority. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
155 
? 
Sections 6, 7 and 8 must be read together. Section 8 imposes a limitation on 
concession provided under Sections 6 and 7 to a person under disability up to a 
maximum of three years after the cessation of disability. The Section applies to all 
suits except suits to enforce rights of pre-emption. 
The period of three years under Section 6 of this Act has to be counted, not from 
the date of attainment of majority by the person under disability, but from the date of 
cessation of minority or disability. 
Both Sections 6 and 7 go together. Section 7 is an extension of Section 6, where 
the point of time at which the existence of disability is to be recognized i.e. ―the time 
from which the period of limitation is to be reckoned‖. 
Section 7 is only an application of the principle in Section 6 to a joint-right 
inherited by a group of persons wherein some or all of whom are under the disability. 
The disability of all except one does not prevent the running of time, if the discharge 
can be given without the concurrence of the other. Otherwise the time will run only 
when the disability is removed. 
To apply Section 7, disability must exist when the right to apply accrued, i.e., at 
the time from which period of limitation is to be reckoned. 
In other words, Section 8 provides that in those cases where the application of 
Section 6 or 7 of the Act results in an extension of the period prescribed by Schedule, 
that extension is not to be more than three years after the cessation of the disability.

Which of the following authorities do not have the power to extend the period as per 
Section 5? 
 
(a) Labour courts 
 
(b) Quasi-judicial tribunals 
 
(c) High Court 
 
(d) Executive authorities 
Correct answer: a, b and d 
 
5. CONTINUOUS RUNNING OF TIME 
According to Section 9 of the Act where once time has begun to 
run, no subsequent disability or inability to institute a suit or make an 
application can stop it provided that where letters of administration to 
the estate of a creditor have been granted to his debtor, the running of 
the period of limitation for a suit to recover debt shall be suspended 
while the administration continues. 
The rule of this Section is based on the English dictum. ―Time when once it has 
commenced to run in any case will not cease to be so by reason of any subsequent 
event‖. Thus, when any of the statutes of limitation is begun to run, no subsequent 
disability or inability will stop this running. 
EP-GCL-3 
156 
The applicability of this Section is limited to suits and applications only and does 
not apply to appeals unless the case fell within any of the exceptions provided in the 
Act itself. 
For the applicability of Section 9 it is essential that the cause of action or the right 
to move the application must continue to exist and subsisting on the date on which a 
particular application is made. If a right itself had been taken away by some 
subsequent event, no question of bar of limitation will arise as the starting point of 
limitation for that particular application will be deemed not to have been commenced. 
Thus, time runs when the cause of action accrues. True test to determine when a 
cause of action has accrued is to ascertain the time, when plaintiff could have 
maintained his action to a successful result first if there is an infringement of a right at 
a particular time, the whole cause of action will be said to have arisen then and there. 
Section 9 contemplates only cases where the cause of action continues to exist. 
Section 10 excludes suits against trustees and their representatives from the purview 
of the Act. In order to invoke the application of Section 10 the property must be 
vested in a trustee or trustees for a specific-purpose. 
6. COMPUTATION OF PERIOD OF LIMITATION 
(i) Exclusion of certain days or exclusion of time in legal proceedings 
While computing Period of Limitation certain day/days are to be excluded. 
Part III of the Act containing Sections 12 to 24 deals with computation of period of 
limitation and Section 12 prescribes the time which shall be excluded in computing 
the time of limitation in legal proceedings. 
Computation of period of limitation for a suit, appeal or application: According to 
Section 12(1), the day which is to be excluded in computing period of limitation is the 
day from which the period of limitation is to be reckoned. In case of any suit, appeal 
or application, the period of limitation is to be computed exclusive of the day on which 
the time begins to run. 
Computation of period of limitation for an appeal or an application for leave to 
appeal or for revision or for review of a judgement. The day on which the judgement 
complained of was pronounced and the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the 
decree, sentence or order appealed from or sought to be revised or reviewed shall be 
excluded [Section 12(2)]. 
Computation of period for an application made for leave to appeal from a decree 
or order. The time requisite for obtaining a copy of the judgement shall also be 
excluded [Section 12(3)]. 
Computation of Limitation period for an application to set aside an award: The 
time required for obtaining a copy of the award shall be excluded [Section 12(4)]. 
Thus, the time required for getting copies of certain decisions, mentioned under 
Section 12 is also to be excluded in computing the period of limitation as per Sub-
sections (2), (3) and (4). 
The term ―time requisite for obtaining a copy‖ means the time which is reasonably 
required for obtaining such a copy, On the explanation to Section 12, the Supreme 
Court in the case of Udayan China Bhai v. R.C. Bali, AIR 1977 SC 2319, held that by 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
157 
reading Section 12(2) with explanation it is not possible to accept the submission that 
in computing the time requisite for obtaining copy of a decree by an application made 
after preparation of the decree, the time that elapsed between the pronouncement of 
the judgement and the signing of the decree should be excluded. 
However, the time taken by the Court to prepare the decree or order before an 
application for a copy is made shall not be excluded in computing the time for 
obtaining a copy of a decree or an order. (Explanation to Section 12) 
(ii) Exclusion of time during which leave to sue or appeal as a pauper is applied for 
(Section 13). 
(iii) Exclusion of time bona fide taken in a court without jurisdiction. (Section 14) 
The relief to a person is given by Section 14 of the Act when the period of 
limitation is over, because another civil proceedings relating to the matter in issue 
had been initiated in a court which is unable to entertain it, by lack of jurisdiction or by 
any other like cause. The following conditions must co-exist for the applicability of this 
Section: 
 
(a) that the plaintiff or the applicant was prosecuting another civil proceedings 
against the defendant with due diligence; 
 
(b) that the previous suit or application related to the same matter in issue; 
 
(c) that the plaintiff or the applicant prosecuted in good-faith in that court; and 
 
(d) that the court was unable to entertain a suit or application on account of 
defect of jurisdiction or other like cause. 
(iv) Exclusion of time in certain other cases 
(a) When a suit or application for the execution of a decree has been stayed by 
an injunction or order, the time of the continuance of the injunction or order, the day 
on which it was issued or made and the day on which it was withdrawn shall be 
excluded. [Section 15(1)] 
(b) The time required to obtain the sanction or consent of the Govt. required, or a 
notice period shall also be excluded in case of suits. [Section 15(2)] 
(c) In a suit or an application for execution of a decree by any receiver or interim 
receiver or any liquidator, the period beginning with the date of institution of such 
proceeding and ending with the expiry of three months from the date of their 
appointment shall be excluded. [Section 15(3)] 
(d) The time during which a proceeding to set aside the sale has been 
prosecuted shall be excluded in case of a suit for possession by a purchaser at a sale

EP-GCL-3 
158 
application. The same rule applies in case if defendant dies. [Sections 16(1) and (2)] 
However, the above rule does not apply to suits to enforce rights of pre-emption 
or to suits for the possession of immovable property or of a hereditary office.  
[Section 16(3)] 
(g) Where the suit or application is based upon the fraud or mistake of the 
defendant or respondent or his agent or in other cases as mentioned in Section 17, 
the period of limitation shall not begin to run until the plaintiff or applicant has 
discovered fraud or mistake subject to certain exceptions. (Section 17) 
7. EFFECT OF ACKNOWLEDGEMENT ON THE PERIOD OF LIMITATION 
Section 18 of the Act deals with the effect of acknowledgement of 
liability in respect of property or right on the period of limitation. The 
following requirements should be present for a valid acknowledgement 
as per Section 18: 
 
1. There must be an admission or acknowledgement; 
 
2. Such acknowledgement must be in respect of any property or right; 
 
3. It must be made before the expiry of period of limitation; and 
 
4. It must be in writing and signed by the party against whom such property or 
right is claimed. 
If all the above requirements are satisfied, a fresh period of limitation shall be 
computed from the time when the acknowledgement was signed. 
8. EFFECT OF PAYMENT ON ACCOUNT OF DEBT OR OF INTEREST ON 
LEGACY 
As per Section 19 of the Act where payment on account of a debt or of interest 
on a legacy is made before the expiration of the prescribed period by the person 
liable to pay the debt or legacy or by his agent duly authorised in this behalf, a fresh 
period of limitation shall be computed from the time when the payment was made. 
The proviso says that, save in the case of payment of interest made before the 1st 
day of January, 1928 an acknowledgement of the payment must appear in the 
handwriting of, or in a writing signed by the person making the payment. 
According to the explanation appended to this Section: 
 
(a) where mortgaged land is in the possession of the mortgagee, the receipt of 
the rent or produce of such land shall be deemed to be a payment; 
 
(b) ‗debt‘ does not include money payable under a decree or order of a court for 
the purpose of this Section. 
Thus, according to this section a fresh period of limitation becomes available to 
the creditor from the date of part payment when part-payment of debt is made by the 
debtor before the expiration of the period of limitation. 
9. COMPUTATION OF TIME MENTIONED IN INSTRUMENTS 
All instruments shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to be made with 
reference to the Gregorian Calendar. (Section 24)

10. ACQUISITION OF OWNERSHIP BY POSSESSION 
Section 25 applies to acquisition of easements. It provides that the right to 
access and use of light or air, way, watercourse, use of water, or any other easement 
which have been peaceably enjoyed without interruption and for twenty years (thirty 
years if property belongs to Government) shall be absolute and indefeasible. Such 
period of twenty years shall be a period ending within two years next before the 
institution of the suit. 
11. LIMITATION AND WRITS UNDER THE CONSTITUTION 
The subject of limitation is dealt with in entry 13, List III of the Constitution of 
India. The Legislature may, without violating the fundamental rights, enact statutes 
prescribing limitation within which actions may be brought or varying or changing the 
existing rules of limitation either by shortening or extending time provided a 
reasonable time is allowed for enforcement of the existing right of action which would 
become barred under the amended Statute. 
The Statute of Limitation is not unconstitutional since it applies to right of action in 
future. It is a shield and not a weapon of offence (34 American Jurisprudence, P. 16). 
The State cannot place any hindrance by prescribing a period of limitation in the 
way of an aggrieved person seeking to approach the Supreme Court of India under 
Article 32 of the Constitution. To put curbs in the way of enforcement of Fundamental 
Rights through legislative action might well be questioned under Article 13(2) of the 
Constitution. It is against the State action that Fundamental Rights are claimed 
(Tilokchand Motichand v. H.P. Munshi, AIR 1970 SC 898). 
The Limitation Act does not in terms apply to a proceeding under Article 32 or 
Article 226 of the Constitution. But the Courts act on the analogy of the statute of 
limitation and refuse relief if the delay is more than the statutory period of limitation 
(State of M.P. v. Bhai Lal Bhai, AIR 1964 SC 1006). Where the remedy in a writ 
petition corresponds to a remedy in an ordinary suit and latter remedy is subject to 
bar of a statute of limitation, the Court in its writ jurisdiction adopts in the statute its 
own rule of procedure and in absence of special circumstances imposes the same 
limitation in the writ jurisdiction. 
If the right to property is extinguished by prescription under Section 27 of the 
Limitation Act, 1963, there is no subsisting right to be enforced under Article 32 of the 
Constitution. In other case where the remedy only, not the right, is extinguished by 
limitation the Court will refuse to entertain stale claims on the ground of public policy 
(Tilokchand Motichand v. H.P. Munshi, AIR 1970 SC 898).

V.  LAW RELATING TO EVIDENCE 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
The "Law of Evidence" may be defined as a system of rules for ascertaining 
controverted questions of fact in judicial inquiries. This system of ascertaining the 
facts, which are the essential elements of a right or liability and is the primary and 
perhaps the most difficult function of the Court, is regulated by a set of rules and 
principles known as ―Law of Evidence‖. 
The Indian Evidence Act, 1872 is an Act to consolidate, define and amend the 
Law of Evidence. 
The Act extends to the whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir 
and applies to all judicial proceedings in or before any Court, including Court-martial 
(other than the Court-martial convened unde the Army Act, the Naval Discipline Act 
or the Indian Navy Discipline Act, 1934 or the Air Force Act) but not to affidavits 
presented to any Court or officer, or to proceedings before an arbitrator. 
Judicial Proceedings 
The Act does not define the term "judicial proceedings" but it is defined under 
Section 2(i) of the Criminal Procedure Code as "a proceeding in the course of which 
evidence is or may be legally taken on oath". 
However, the proceedings under the Income Tax are not "judicial proceedings" 
under this Act. That apart, the Act is also not applicable to the proceedings before an 
arbitrator. 
An affidavit is a declaration sworn or affirmed before a person competent to 
administer an oath. Thus, an affidavit per se does not become evidence in the suits 
but it can become evidence only by consent of the party or if specifically authorised 
by any provision of the law. They can be used as evidence only under Order XIX of 
the Civil Procedure Code. 
Evidence: The term evidence is defined under Section 3 of the 
Evidence Act as follows : 
―Evidence‖ means and includes: 
 
(1) all statements which the Court permits or requires to be made before it by 
witnesses, in relation to matters of fact under inquiry; such statements are 
called oral evidence;  
 
(2) all documents (including electronic records) produced for the inspection of 
the Court; such documents are called documentary evidence.  
The word evidence in the Act signifies only the instruments by means of which 
relevant facts are brought before the Court, viz., witnesses and documents, and by 
means of which the court is convinced of these facts. 
Evidence under Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 may be either oral or 
personal (i.e. all statements which the Court permits or requires to be made before it 
EP-GCL-3 
180 
by witnesses, and documentary (documents produced for the inspection of the court), 
which may be adduced in order to prove a certain fact (principal fact) which is in 
issue. There must be an open and visible connection between the principal fact and 
the evidentially facts. Facts are which form part of the same transaction, though not in 
issue, place or at different times and places. 
In general the rules of evidence are same in civil and criminal proceedings but 
there is a strong and marked difference as to the effect of evidence in civil and 
criminal proceedings. In the former a mere preponderance of probability due regard 
being had to the burden of proof, is sufficient basis of a decision, but in the latter, 
specially when the offence charged amounts to felony or treason, a much higher 
degree of assurance is required. The persuasion of guilt must amount to a moral 
certainty such as to be beyond all reasonable doubt. In other words, in civil 
proceedings it is sufficient if the evidence shows that in all probability the accused 
would have committed the wrong; but in criminal proceedings, evidences must show 
beyond all doubts that the accused alone would have committed the crime. 
Scheme of the Act: The Act is divided into three parts: 
 
Part I 
Relevancy of Facts-Chapter I containing Sections 1 to 4 deals with 
preliminary points and relevancy of facts is dealt with in Chapter II 
containing Sections 5 to 55. 
 
Part II 
On proof (Chapters III to VI) containing Sections 56 to 100. 
 Part III 
Production and effect of evidence (Chapters VII to XI containing 
Sections 101 to 167). 
Relevancy of Facts: Sections 6 to 55 of the Act deal with relevancy of facts. A 
fact is also known as Factum Prolans or a fact that proves. The question arises what 
then the term "fact" signifies? 
Fact 
According to Section 3, ―fact‖ means and includes: 
 
(a) anything, state of things, or relation of things capable of being perceived by 
the senses;  
 
(b) any mental condition of which any person is conscious.  
Thus facts are classified into physical and psychological facts. 
Illustrations 
 
(a) That there are certain objects arranged in a certain order in a certain place, 
is a fact.  
 
(b) That a man heard or saw something, is a fact.  
 
(c) That a man said certain words, is a fact.  
 
(d) That a man holds a certain opinion, has a certain intention, acts in good faith 
or fraudulently, or uses a particular word in a particular sense, or is or was at 
the specified time conscious of a particular sensation, is a fact.  
 
(e) That a man has a certain reputation, is a fact.

Evidence may be given of facts in issue and relevant facts 
According to Section 5, evidence may be given in any suit or proceeding of the 
existence or non-existence of every fact in issue and of such other facts as are 
hereinafter declared to be relevant, and of no others. 
The Explanation appended to Section 5, however, makes it clear that this section 
shall not enable any person to give evidence of a fact to which he is disentitled to 
prove by any provision of the law. 
Illustrations 
 
(a) A is tried for the murder of B by beating him with a club with the intention of 
causing his death.  
 
 At A‘s trial the following facts are in issue:- 
 
 A‘s beating B with the club; 
 
 A‘s causing B‘s death by such beating; 
 
 A‘s intention to cause B‘s death. 
 
(b) A suitor does not bring with him and have in readiness for production at the 
first hearing of the case, a bond on which he relies. This section does not 
enable him to produce the bond or prove its contents at a subsequent stage 
of the proceedings, otherwise than in accordance with the conditions 
prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure.  
It is evident that only facts in issue and relevant facts may be given in evidence. 
To understand their relevancy it is necessary to know their meanings. These terms 
are defined in Section 3. It is explained as follows:- 
Relevant Fact 
One fact is said to be relevant to another when the one is connected with the 
other in any of the ways referred to in the provisions of this Act relating to the 
relevancy of facts. (Section 3) 
Where in a case direct evidence is not available to prove a fact in issue then it 
may be proved by any circumstantial evidence and in such a case every piece of 
circumstantial evidence would be an instance of a "relevant fact". 
Logical relevancy and legal relevancy 
A fact is said to be logically relevant to another when it bears such casual relation 
with the other as to render probably the existence or non-existence of the latter. All 
facts logically relevant are not, however, legally relevant. Relevancy under the Act is 
not a question of pure logic but of law, as no fact, however logically relevant, is 
receivable in evidence unless it is declared by the Act to be relevant. Of course every 
fact legally relevant will be found to be logically relevant; but every fact logically 
relevant is not necessarily relevant under the Act as common sense or logical 
relevancy is wider than legal relevancy. A judge might in ordinary transaction, take 
one fact as evidence of another and act upon it himself, when in Court, he may rule 
EP-GCL-3 
182 
? 
that it was legally irrelevant. And he may exclude facts, although logically relevant, if 
they appear to him too remote to be really material to the issue.

State whether the following statement is “True” or “False” 
All facts logically relevant are not, however, legally relevant.  
 
True 
 
False 
Correct answer: True 
 
Legal relevancy and admissibility 
Relevancy and admissibility are not co-extensive or interchangeable terms. A fact 
may be legally relevant, yet its reception in evidence may be prohibited on the 
grounds of public policy, or on some other ground. Similarly every admissible fact is 
not necessarily relevant. The tenth Chapter of the Act makes a number of facts 
receivable in evidence, but these facts are not ―relevant‖ under the second Chapter 
which alone defines relevancy. 
Facts in issue 
According to Section 3 the expression "facts in issue" means and includes-any 
fact from which, either by itself or in connection with other facts, the existence, non-
existence, nature or extent of any right, liability, or disability, asserted or denied in 
any suit or proceedings, necessarily follows. 
Explanation—Whenever, under the provisions of the law for the time being in 
force relating to Civil Procedure, any Court records an issue of fact, the fact to be 
asserted or denied in the answer to such issue is a fact in issue. 
Illustration 
A is accused of the murder of B. 
At his trial the following facts may be in issue: 
that A caused B‘s death; 
that A intended to cause B‘s death; 
that A had received grave and sudden provocation from B; 
that A at the time of doing the act which caused B‘s death, was, by reason of 
unsoundness of mind, incapable of knowing its nature. 
A fact in issue is called as the principal fact to be proved or factum probandum 
and the relevant fact the evidentiary fact or factum probans from which the principal 
fact follows. The fact which constitute the right or liability called ―fact in issue‖ and in a 
particular case the question of determining the ―facts in issue‖ depends upon the rule 
of the substantive law which defines the rights and liabilities claimed. 
Facts in issue and issues of fact 
Under Civil Procedure Code, the Court has to frame issues on all disputed facts 
which are necessary in the case. These are called issues of fact but the subject 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
183 
matter of an issue of fact is always a fact in issue. Thus when described in the 
context of Civil Procedure Code, it is an ‗issue of fact‘ and when described in the 
language of Evidence Act it is a ‗fact in issue‘. Thus as discussed above, distinction 
between facts in issue and relevant facts is of fundamental importance. 
Classification of relevant facts 
Principles of Sections relating to relevancy of facts are mere rules of logic. 
Relevant facts may be classified in the following form: 
 
(a) facts connected with the facts to be proved; (Sections 6 to 16)  
 
(b) statement about the facts to be proved e.g. admission, confession; 
(Sections 17 to 31)  
 
(c) statements by persons who cannot be called as witnesses; (Sections 32 to 33) 
 
(d) statements made under special circumstances; (Sections 34 to 38)  
 
(e) how much of a statement is to be proved; (Section 39)  
 
(f) judgements of Courts of justice, when relevant; (Sections 40 to 44)  
 
(g) opinions of third persons, when relevant; (Sections 45 to 51)  
 
(h) character of parties in Civil cases and of the accussed in criminal cases. 
(Sections 52 to 55)  
Two fundamental rules on which the law of evidence is based are: (a) no facts 
other than those having rational probative value should be admitted in evidence and, 
(b) all facts having rational probative value are admissible in evidence unless 
excluded by a positive rule of paramount importance. 
The Court ‗may presume‘ a fact as may be provided by the Act, unless and until it 
is disproved or may call for proof of it. The court shall presume a fact whenever it is 
directed by this Act, and shall regard such fact as proved unless and until it is 
disproved (Section 4). Presumption has been defined as an inference, affirmative or 
disaffirmative of the existence of some fact, drawn by a judicial tribunal, by a proces 
of probable reasoning from some matter of fact, either judicially noticed, admitted or 
established by legal evidence to the satisfaction of the tribunal. It is an inference of 
the existence of some fact, which is drawn, without evidence, from some other fact 
already proved or assumed to exist (wills). Presumption is either of a fact or law. 
These presumptions which are inference are always rebuttable. Presumption of law is 
either conclusive or rebuttable. 
The Act also provides that when one fact is declared by this Act to be conclusive 
proof of another, the court shall on the proof of the one fact, regard the other as 
proved and shall not allow evidence to be given for the purpose of disproving it. 
2. RELEVANCY OF FACTS CONNECTED WITH THE FACT TO BE PROVED  
The facts coming under this category are as follows: 
(1) Res gestae or facts which though not in issue, are so connected with a fact in 
issue as to form part of the same transaction.  
Section 6 embodies the rule of admission of evidence relating to what is 
commonly known as res gestae. Acts or declarations accompanying the transaction 
EP-GCL-3 
184 
or the facts in issue are treated as part of the res gestae and admitted as evidence. 
The obvious ground for admission of such evidence is the spontaneity and 
immediacy of the act or declaration in question. 
Illustration 
A is accused of the murder of B by beating him. Whatever was said or done by A 
or B or the by-standers at the beating, or so shortly before or after it as to form part of 
the transaction, is a relevant fact.  
The word ‗by-standers‘ means the persons who are present at the time of the 
beating and not the persons who gather on the spot after the beating (46 P.L.R. 353); 
(1945) Lah. 146). 
(b) A is accused of waging war against the ‗Government of India by taking part in 
an armed insurrection in which property is destroyed, troops are attacked and gaols 
are broken open. The occurrence of these facts is relevant, as forming part of the 
general transaction, although A may not have been present at all of them.  
(c) A sues B for a libel contained in a letter forming part of a correspondence. 
Letters between the parties relating to the subject out of which the libel arose, and 
forming part of the correspondence in which it is contained, are relevant facts, though 
they do not contain the libel itself.  
(d) The question is, whether certain goods ordered from B were delivered to A. 
The goods were delivered to several intermediate persons successively. Each 
delivery is a relevant fact.  
Thus, the evidence about the fact which is also connected with the same 
transaction, cannot be said to be inadmissible. 
The above section lays down the rule which in English text books is treated under 
the head of res gestae. It may be broadly defined as matter incidental to the main fact 
and explanatory of it, including acts and words which are so closely connected 
therewith as to constitute a part of the same transaction. 
The essence of the doctrine of res gestae is that the facts which, though not in 
issue are so connected with the fact in issue as to form part of the same transaction 
and thereby become relevant like fact in issue (AIR 1957 Cal. 709). 
(2) Facts constituting the occasion, or effect of, or opportunity or state of things 
for the occurrence of the fact to be proved whether it be a fact or another relevant 
fact. (Section 7)  
Illustrations 
(a) The question is, whether A robbed B.  
The facts that, shortly before the robbery, B went to a fair with money in his 
possession, and that he showed it, or mentioned the fact that he had it, to third 
persons, are relevant. 
(b) The question is, whether A murdered B.  
Marks on the ground, produced by a struggle at or near the place whether the 
murder was committed, are relevant facts. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
185 
(c) The question is, whether A poisoned B.  
The state of B‘s health before the symptoms ascribed to poison, and habits of B 
known to A, which afforded an opportunity for the administration of poison, are 
relevant facts. 
The above transaction provides that, though they are not part of the same 
transaction, are relevant if they are the occasions caused or effects of facts of an 
issue. 
(3) Motive, preparation and previous or subsequent conduct.  
According to Section 8, any fact is relevant which shows or constitutes a motive 
or preparation for any fact in issue or relevant fact. 
Motive means which moves a person to act in a particular way. It is different from 
intention. The substantive law is rarely concerned with motive, but the existence of a 
motive, from the point of view of evidence would be a relevant fact, in every criminal 
case. That is the first step in every investigation. Motive is a psychological fact and 
the accused‘s motive, will have to be proved by circumstantial evidence. When the 
question is as to whether a person did a particular act, the fact that he made 
preparations to do it, would certainly be relevant for the purpose of showing that he 
did it. 
The Section makes the conduct of certain persons relevant. Conduct means 
behaviour. The conduct of the parties is relevant. The conduct to be relevant must be 
closely connected with the suit, proceeding, a fact in issue or a relevant fact, i.e., if 
the Court believes such conduct to exist, it must assist the Court in coming to a 
conclusion on the matter in controversy. It must influence the decision. If these 
conditions are satisfied it is immaterial whether the conduct was previous to or 
subsequent to the happening of the fact in issue. 
Illustrations 
(a) A is tried for the murder of B.  
The fact that A murdered C, that B knew that A had murdered C, and that B had 
tried to extort money from A by threatening to make his knowledge public, are 
relevant. 
(b) A sues B upon a bond for the payment of money. B denies the making of the 
bond.  
The fact that, at the time when the bond was alleged to be made, B required 
money for a particular purpose, is relevant. 
(c) A is tried for the murder of B by poison.  
The fact that, before the death of B, A procured poison similar to that which was 
administered to B, is relevant. 
(d) The question is, whether a certain document is the will of A.  
The facts that, not long before the date of the alleged will, A made inquiry into 
matters to which the provisions of the alleged will relate that he consulted Vakils in 
reference to making the will, and that he caused drafts of other wills to be prepared, 
of which he did not approve, are relevant. 
EP-GCL-3 
186 
(e) A is accused of a crime.  
The facts that, either before, or at the time of, or after the alleged crime, A 
provided evidence which would tend to give to the facts of the case an appearance 
favourable to himself, or that he destroyed or concealed evidence, or prevented the 
presence or procured the absence of persons who might have been witnesses, or 
suborned persons to give false evidence respecting it, are relevant. 
(f) The question is, whether A robbed B.  
The facts that, after B was robbed, C said in A‘s presence - ―the police is coming 
to look for the man who robbed B‖, and that immediately afterwards A ran away, are 
relevant. 
(g) The question is, whether A owes B rupees 10,000.  
The facts that A asked C to lend him money, and that D said to C in A‘s presence 
and hearing—―I advise you not to trust A, for he owes B 10,000 rupees‖, and that A 
went away without making any answer, are relevant facts. 
(h) The question is, whether A committed a crime.  
The fact that A absconded after receiving a letter warning him that inquiry was 
being made for the criminal, and the contents of the letter, are relevant. 
(i) A is accused of a crime.  
The facts that, after the commission of the alleged crime, he absconded, or was 
in possession of property or the proceeds of properly acquired by the crime, or 
attempted to conceal things which were or might have been used in committing it, are 
relevant. 
(j) The question is, whether A was ravished.  
The facts that, shortly after the alleged rape, she made a complaint relating to the 
crime, the circumstances under which, and the terms in which, the complaint was 
made, are relevant. 
The fact that, without making a complaint she said that she had been ravished is 
not relevant as conduct under this Section, though it may be relevant as a dying 
declaration under Section 32, clause (1), or as corroborative evidence under  
Section 157. 
(k) the question is, whether A was robbed.  
The fact that, soon after the alleged robbery, he made a complaint relating to the 
offence, the circumstances under which, and the terms in which, the complaint was 
made are relevant. 
The fact that he said he had been robbed without making any complaint, is not 
relevant, as conduct under this section, though it may be relevant as a dying 
declaration under Section 32, clause (1), or as corroborative evidence under  
Section 157. 
What is relevant under Section 8 is the particular act upon the statement and the 
statement and the act must be so blended together as to form a part of a thing 
observed by the witnesses and sought to be proved. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
187 
(4) Facts necessary to explain or introduce relevant facts.  
According to Section 9, such facts are - 
 
(i) which are necessary to explain or introduce a fact in issue or relevant fact, 
or  
 
(ii) which support or rebut an inference suggested by a fact in issue or relevant 
fact, or  
 
(iii) which establish the identity of a person or thing whose identity is relevant, or 
fix the time or place at which any fact in issue or relevant fact happened, or  
 
(iv) which show the relation of parties by whom any such fact was transacted, 
are relevant in so far as they are necessary for that purpose.  
Facts which establish the identity of an accused person are relevant under 
Section 9. 
Illustrations 
(a) The question is, whether a given document is the will of A.  
The state of A‘s property and of his family at the date of the alleged will may be 
relevant facts. 
(b) A sues B for a libel imputing disgraceful conduct to A; B affirms that the 
matter alleged to be libellous is true.  
The position and relations of the parties at the time when the libel was published 
may be relevant facts as introductory to the facts in issue. 
The particulars of a dispute between A and B about a matter unconnected with 
the alleged libel are irrelevant, though the fact that there was a dispute may be 
relevant if it affected the relations between A and B. 
(c) A is accused of a crime.  
The fact that, soon after the commission of the crime, A absconded from his 
house, is relevant under Section 8, as conduct subsequent to and affected by facts in 
issue. 
The fact that, at the time when he left house, he had sudden and urgent business 
at the place to which he went, is relevant, as tending to explain the fact that the left 
home suddenly. 
The details of the business on which he left are not relevant, except in so far as 
they are necessary to show that the business was sudden and urgent. 
(d) A sues B for inducing C to break a contract of service made by him with A. C, 
on leaving A‘s service, says to A—―I am leaving you because B has made me a 
better offer‖. This statement is a relevant fact as explanatory of C‘s conduct, which is 
relevant as a fact in issue.  
(e) A accused of theft, is seen to give the stolen property to B, who is seen to 
give it to A‘s wife. B says as he delivers it - ―A says you are to hide this‖. B‘s 
statement is relevant as explanatory of a fact which is part of the transaction.

3. STATEMENTS ABOUT THE FACTS TO BE PROVED  
The general rule known as the hearsay rule is that what is stated about the fact in 
question is irrelevant. To this general rule there are three exceptions which are : 
 
(i) Admissions and confessions;  
 
(ii) Statements as to certain matters under certain circumstances by persons 
who are not witnesses; and  
 
(iii) Statements made under special circumstances.  
(i) Admissions and Confessions  
Sections 17 to 31 lay down the first exception to the general rule known as 
admissions and confessions. 
Admissions 
An admission is defined in Section 17 as a statement, oral or 
documentary or contained in electronic form which suggests any 
inference as to any fact in issue or relevant fact, and which is made by 
any of the persons, and under the circumstances mentioned under 
Sections 18 to 20. Thus, whether a statement amounts to an admission or not 
depends upon the question whether it was made by any of the persons and in any of 
the circumstances described in Sections 18-20 and whether it suggests an inference 
as to a fact in issue or a relevant fact in the case. Thus admission may be verbal or 
contained in documents as maps, bills, receipts, letters, books etc. 
(However, the word ‗statement‘ has not been defined in the Act. Therefore the 
ordinary dictionary meaning is to be followed which is ―something that is stated.") 
An admission may be made by a party, by the agent or predecessor-in-interest of 
a party, by a person having joint propriety of pecuniary interest in the subject matter 
(Section 18) or by a ―reference‖ (Section 20). 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
189 
An admission is the best evidence against the party making the same unless it is 
untrue and made under the circumstances which does not make it binding on him. 
An admission by the Government is merely relevant and non conclusive, unless 
the party to whom they are made has acted upon and thus altered his detriment. 
An admission must be clear, precise, not vague or ambiguous. In Basant Singh v. 
Janky Singh, (1967) 1 SCR 1, The Supreme Court held: 
―(1) Section 17 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 makes no distinction between an 
admission made by a party in a pleading and other admission. Under the Indian law, 
an admission made by a party in a plaint signed and verified by him may be used as 
evidence against him in other suits. In other suits, this admission cannot be regarded 
as conclusive and it is open to the party to show that it is not true.  
(2) All the statements made in the plaint are admissible as evidence. The Court 
is, however, not bound to accept all the statements as correct. The Court may accept 
some of the statements and reject the rest.‖  
Admission means conceding something against the person making the 
admission. That is why it is stated as a general rule (the exceptions are in Section 
21), that admissions must be self-harming; and because a person is unlikely to make 
a statement which is self-harming unless it is true evidence of such admissions as 
received in Court. 
These Sections deal only with admissions oral and written. Admissions by 
conduct are not covered by these sections. The relevancy of such admissions by 
conduct depends upon Section 8 and its explanations. 
Oral admissions as to the contents of electronic records are not relevant unless 
the genuineness of the record produced is in question. (Section 22A) 
Confessions 
Sections 24 to 30 deal with confessions. However, the Act does not define a 
confession but includes in it admissions of which it is a species. Thus confessions are 
special form of admissions. Whereas every confession must be an admission but 
every admission may not amount to a confession. Sections 27 to 30 deal with 
confessions which the Court will take into account. A confession is relevant as an 
admission unless it is made: 
 
(i) to a person in authority in consequence of some inducement, threat or 
promise held out by him in reference to the charge against the accused;  
 
(ii) to a Police Officer; or  
 
(iii) to any one at a time when the accused is in the custody of a Police Officer 
and no Magistrate is present.  
Thus, a statement made by an accused person if it is an admission, is admissible 
in evidence. The confession is an evidence only against its maker and against 
another person who is being jointly tried with him for an offence. 
Section 30 is an exception to the general rule that confession is only an evidence 
against the confessor and not against the others. 
EP-GCL-3 
190 
? 
The confession made in front of magistrate in a native state recorded is 
admissible against its maker is also admissible against co-accused under Section 30. 
The Privy Council in Pakala Narayanaswami v. Emperor, (1929) PC 47, observed 
that: 
No statement that contains self exculpatory matter can amount 
to confession, if the exculpatory statement is of some fact which 
if true would negative the offence alleged to be confessed. All 
confessions are admissions but not vice versa. 
A confession must, either admit, in terms the offence, or substantially all the facts 
which constitute the offence. An admission of a gravely incriminating fact, is not of 
itself a confession. For example, an admission that the accused was the owner of 
and was in recent possession of the knife or revolver which caused a death with no 
explanation of any other man‘s possession of the knife or revolver. A confession 
cannot be construed as meaning a statement by the accused suggesting the 
inference that he committed the crime. 
According to Section 24, confession caused by inducement, threat or promise is 
irrelevant. To attract the prohibition contained in Section 24 of the Evidence Act the 
following six facts must be established: 
 
(i) that the statement in question is a confession;  
 
(ii) that such confession has been made by an accused person;  
 
(iii) that it has been made to a person in authority;  
 
(iv) that the confession has been obtained by reason of any inducement, threat 
or promise proceeded from a person in authority;  
 
(v) such inducement, threat or promise, must have reference to the charge 
against the accused person;  
 
(vi) the inducement, threat or promise must in the opinion of the Court be 
sufficient to give the accused person grounds, which would appear to him 
reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or 
avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against 
him.  
To exclude the confession it is not always necessary to prove that it was the 
result of inducement, threat or promise. It is sufficient if a legitimate doubt is created 
in the mind of the Court or it appears to the Court that the confession was not 
voluntary. It is however for the accused to create this doubt and not for the 
prosecution to prove that it was voluntarily made. A confession if voluntary and 
truthfully made is an efficacious proof of guilt.

Confessions vs. Admissions 
A confession, however, is received in evidence for the same reason as an 
admission, and like an admission it must be considered as a whole. Further there can 
be an admission either in a civil or a criminal proceedings, whereas there can be a 
confession only in criminal proceedings. An admission need not be voluntary to be 
relevant, though it may effect its weight; but a confession to be relevant, must be 
voluntary. There can be relevant admission made by an agent or even a stranger, 
but, a confession to be relevant must be made by the accused himself. A confession 
of a co-accused is not strictly relevant, though it may be taken into consideration, 
under Section 30 in special circumstances. 
Confessions are classified as: (a) judicial, and (b) extra-judicial. Judicial 
confessions are those made before a Court or recorded by a Magistrate under 
Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code after following the prescribed procedure 
such as warning the accused that he need not to make the confession and that if he 
made it, it would be used against him. Extra-judicial confessions are those which are 
made either to the police or to any person other than Judges and Magistrates as 
such. 
An extra-judicial confession, if voluntary, can be relied upon by the Court along 
with other evidence. It will have to be proved just like any other fact. The value of the 
evidence depends upon the truthfulness of the witness to whom it is made. 
In Ram Khilari v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1999 SC 1002, the Supreme Court held 
that where an extra-judicial confession was made before a witness who was a close 
relative of the accused and the testimony of said witness was reliable and truthful, the 
conviction on the basis of extra judicial confession is proper. 
In another case, the Supreme Court has further held that the law does not require 
that the evidence of an extra-judicial confession should be corroborated in all cases. 
When such confession was proved by an independent witness who was a 
responsible officer and one who bore no animus against the accused, there is hardly 
any justification to disbelieve it. Also, where the Court finds that the confession made 
by the accused to his friend was unambiguous and unmistakably conveyed that the 
accused was the perpetrator of the crime and the testimony of the friend was truthful, 
reliable and trustworthy, a conviction based on such extra-judicial confession is 
proper and no corroboration is necessary. Much importance could not be given to 
minor discrepancies and technical errors (Vinayak Shivajirao Pol v. State of 
Maharashtra, 1998 (1) Scale 159).

He produces a letter written by himself and dated at Lahore on that day, and 
bearing the Lahore post-mark of that day. The statement in the date of the letter is 
admissible, because if A were dead, it would be admissible under Section 32,  
clause (2). 
5. A and B are jointly tried for the murder of C. It is proved that A said-―B and I 
murdered C‖. The Court may consider the effect of this confession as against B.  
6. A is on his trial for the murder of C. There is evidence to show that C was 
murdered by A and B, and that B said—―A and I murdered C‖.  
This statement may not be taken into consideration by the Court against A, as B 
is not being jointly tried. (If there is joint trial Section 30 applies) 
Illustrations 5 and 6 are exceptions to the general rule that a confession is only 
evidence against the person who makes the confession. These are based on Section 
30 of the Act. 
(ii) Statements by persons who cannot be called as witnesses  
Certain statements made by persons who are dead, or cannot be found or 
produced without unreasonable delay or expense, makes the second exception to the 
general rule. However, the following conditions must be fulfilled for the relevancy of 
the statements: 
 
(a) That the statement must relate to a fact in issue or relevant fact,  
 
(b) That the statement must fall under any of following categories:  
 
(i) the statement is made by a person as to the cause of this death or as to 
any of the circumstances resulting in his death;  
 
(ii) statement made in the course of business;  
 
(iii) Statement which is against the interest of the maker;  
 
(iv) a statement giving the opinion as to the public right or custom or matters 
of general interest;  
 
(v) a statement made before the commencement of the controversy as to 
the relationship of persons, alive or dead, if the maker of the statement 
has special means of knowledge on the subject;  
 
(vi) a statement made before the commencement of the controversy as to 
the relationship of persons deceased, made in any will or deed relating 
to family affairs to which any such deceased person belong;  
 
(vii) a statement in any will, deed or other document relating to any 
transaction by which a right or custom was created, claimed, modified, 
etc.;  
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
193 
 
(viii) a statement made by a number of persons expressing their feelings or 
impression;  
 
(ix) evidence given in a judicial proceeding or before a person authorised by 
law to take it, provided that the proceeding was between the same 
parties or their representatives in interest and the adverse party in the 
first proceeding had the right and opportunity to cross examine and the 
questions in issue were substantially the same as in the first proceeding.  
Illustrations 
(a) The question is, whether A was murdered by B; or  
A dies of injuries received in a transaction in the course of which she was 
ravished. The question is, whether she was ravished by B; or 
The question is, whether A was killed by B under such circumstances that a suit 
would lie against B by A‘s widow. 
Statements made by A as to the course of his or her death, referring respectively 
to the murder, the rape and the actionable wrong under consideration are relevant 
facts. 
(b) The question is as to the date of A‘s birth.  
An entry in the diary of a deceased surgeon regularly kept in the course of 
business, stating that, on a given day, he attended A‘s mother and delivered her of a 
son, is a relevant fact. 
(c) The question is, whether A and B were legally married.  
The statement of a deceased clergyman that he married them under such 
circumstances that the celebration would be a crime, is relevant. 
(d) The question is, whether A, who is dead, was the father of B.  
A statement by A that B was his own son, is a relevant fact. 
(e) A sues B for libel expressed in a painted caricature exposed in a shop 
window. The question is as to the similarity of the caricature and its libellous 
character. The remarks of a crowd of spectators on these points may be proved.  
(iii) Statements made under special circumstances  
The following statements become relevant on account of their having been made 
under special circumstances: 
 
(i) Entries made in books of account, including those maintained in an 
electronic form regularly kept in the course of business. Such entries, though 
relevant, cannot, alone, be sufficient to charge a person with liability; 
(Section 34)  
 
(ii) Entries made in public or official records or an electronic record made by a 
public servant in the discharge of his official duties, or by any other person in 
performance of a duty specially enjoined by the law; (Section 35)  
EP-GCL-3

? 
 
(iii) Statements made in published maps or charts generally offered for the 
public sale, or in maps or plans made under the authority of the Central 
Government or any State government; (Section 36)  
 
(iv) Statement as to fact of public nature contained in certain Acts or notification; 
(Section 37)  
 
(v) Statement as to any foreign law contained in books purporting to be printed 
or published by the Government of the foreign country, or in reports of 
decisions of that country. (Section 38)  
When any statement of which evidence is given forms part of a longer statement, 
or of a conversation or part of an isolated document, or is contained in a document 
which forms part of a book, or is contained in part of electronic record or of a 
connected series of letters or papers, evidence shall be given of so much and no 
more of the statement, conversation, document, electronic record, book or of letters 
or papers as the Court considers necessary in that particular case to the full 
understanding of the nature and effect of the statement, and of the circumstances 
under which it was made. (Section 39)

OPINION OF THIRD PERSONS WHEN RELEVANT  
The general rule is that opinion of a witness on a question whether of fact or law, 
is irrelevant. However, there are some exceptions to this general rule. These are: 
(i) Opinions of experts. (Section 45)  
Illustrations 
(a) The question is, whether the death of A was caused by poison.  
The opinions of experts as to the symptoms produced by the poison by which A 
is supposed to have died, are relevant. 
(b) The question is, whether a certain document was written by A. Another 
document is produced which is proved or admitted to have been written by A.  
The opinions of experts on the question whether the two documents were written 
by the same person or by different persons, are relevant. Similarly the opinions of 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
195 
experts on typewritten documents as to whether a given document is typed on a 
particular typewriter is relevant. 
As a general rule the opinion of a witness on a question whether of fact, or of law, 
is irrelevant. Witness has to state the facts which he has seen, heard or perceived, 
and noted the conclusion, form of observations. The functions of drawing inferences 
from facts is a judicial function and must be performed by the Court. However, to this 
general rule, there are some exceptions as indicated in Section 45. Opinions of 
experts are relevant upon a point of (a) foreign law (b) science (c) art (d) identity of 
hand writing (e) finger impression special knowledge of the subject matter of enquiry 
become relevant. 
 
(ii) Facts which support or are inconsistent with the opinions of experts are also 
made relevant. (Section 46)  
 
(iii) Others: In addition to the opinions of experts, opinion of any other person is 
also relevant in the following cases :  
 
(a) Opinion as to the handwriting of a person if the person giving the 
opinion is acquainted with the handwriting of the person in question; 
(Section 47)  
 
(b) Opinion as to the digital signature of any person, the opinion of the 
Certifying Authority which has issued the Digital Signature Certificate; 
(Section 47A)  
 
(c) Opinion as to the existence of any general right or custom if the person 
giving the opinion is likely to be aware of the existence of such right or 
custom; (Section 48)  
 
(d) Opinion as to usages etc. words and terms used in particular districts, 
if the person has special means of knowledge on the subject; 
(Section 49)  
 
(e) Opinion expressed by conduct as the existence of any relationship by 
persons having special means of knowledge on the subject. 
(Section 50)  
5. FACTS OF WHICH EVIDENCE CANNOT BE GIVEN  
    (PRIVILIGED COMMUNICATIONS)  
There are some facts of which evidence cannot be given though they 
are relevant. Such facts are stated under Sections 122, 123, 126 and 
127, where evidence is prohibited under those Sections. They are 
also referred to as ‗privileged communications‘ 
A witness though compellable to give evidence is privileged in respect of 
particular matters within the limits of which he is not bound to answer questions while 
giving evidence. These are based on public policy and are as follows: 
 
(i) Evidence of a Judge or Magistrate in regard to certain matters; (Section 121)  
 
(ii) Communications during marriage; (Section 122)  
 
(iii) Affairs of State; (Section 123)  
 
(iv) Official communications; (Section 124)  
EP-GCL-3 
196 
? 
 
(v) Source of information of a Magistrate or Police officer or Revenue officer as 
to commission of an offence or crime; (Section 125)  
 
(vi) In the case of professional communication between a client and his 
barrister, attorney or other professional or legal advisor (Sections 126 and 
129). But this privilege is not absolute and the client is entitled to waive it.  
Under Section 122 of the Act, communication between the husband and the wife 
during marriage is privileged and its disclosure cannot be enforced. This provision is 
based on the principle of domestic peace and confidence between the spouses. The 
Section contains two parts; the first part deals with the privilege of the witness while 
the second part of the Section deals with the privilege of the husband or wife of the 
witness. 
Evidence as to affairs of State 
Section 123 applies only to evidence derived from unpublished official record 
relating to affairs of State. According to Section 123, no one shall be permitted to give 
any evidence derived from unpublished official records relating to any affairs of State, 
except with the permission of the officer at the head of the department concerned, 
who shall give or withhold such permission as he thinks fit. 
Professional communications 
Section 126 to 129 deal with the professional communications between a legal 
adviser and a client, which are protected from disclosure. A client cannot be 
compelled and a legal adviser cannot be allowed without the express consent of his 
client to disclose oral or documentary communications passing between them in 
professional confidence. The rule is founded on the impossibility of conducting legal 
business without professional assistance and securing full and unreserved 
communication between the two. Under Sections 126 and 127 neither a legal adviser 
i.e. a barrister, attorney, pleader or vakil (Section 126) nor his interpreter, clerk or 
servant (Section 128) can be permitted to disclose any communication made to him 
in the course and for the purpose of professional employment of such legal adviser or 
to state the contents or condition of any document with which any such person has 
become acquainted in the course and for the purpose of such employment. 
In general it is not open to a party to test the credit or impeach the ―truthfulness of 
a witness offered by him. But the Court can in its discretion allow a party to cross 
examine his witness‖ if the witness unexpectedly turns hostile. (Section 154)

6. ORAL, DOCUMENTARY AND CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE  
As discussed above, all facts (except two Sections 56 and 58) which are neither 
admitted nor are subject to judicial notice must be proved. The Act divides the subject 
of proof into two parts: (i) proof of facts other than the contents of documents; (ii) 
proof of documents including proof of execution of documents and proof of existence, 
condition and contents of documents. 
However, all facts except contents of documents or electronic records may be 
proved by oral evidence (Section 59) which must in all cases be ―direct‖ (Section 60). 
The direct evidence means the evidence of the person who perceived the fact to 
which he deposes. 
Thus, the two broad rules regarding oral evidence are: 
 
(i) all facts except the contents of documents may be proved by oral evidence;  
 
(ii) oral evidence must in all cases be ―direct‖.  
Oral evidence means statements which the Court permits or requires to be made 
before it by witnesses in relation to matters of fact under inquiry. But, if a witness is 
unable to speak he may give his evidence in any manner in which he can make it 
intelligible as by writing or by signs. (Section 119) 
Direct evidence 
In Section 60 of the Evidence Act, expression "oral evidence" has an altogether 
different meaning. It is used in the sense of "original evidence" as distinguished from 
"hearsay" evidence and it is not used in contradicition to "circumstantial" or 
"presumptive evidence". According to Section 60 oral evidence must in all cases 
whatever, be direct; that is to say: 
 
— if it refers to a fact which could be seen, it must be the evidence of a witness 
who says he saw it; 
 
— if it refers to a fact which could be heard, it must be the evidence of a 
witness who says he heard it; 
 
— if it refers to a fact which could be perceived by any other sense or in any 
other manner, it must be the evidence of a witness who says he perceived it 
by that sense or in that manner; 
 
— if it refers to an opinion or to the grounds on which that opinion is held, it 
must be the evidence of the person who holds that opinion on those 
grounds. 
Thus, if the fact to be proved is one that could be seen, the person who saw the 
fact must appear in the Court to depose it, and if the fact to be proved is one that 
could be heard, the person who heard it must appear in the Court to depose before it 
and so on. In defining the direct evidence in Section 60, the Act impliedly enacts what 
is called the rule against hearsay. Since the evidence as to a fact which could be 
seen, by a person who did not see it, is not direct but hearsay and so is the evidence 
as to a statement, by a person who did hear it. 
EP-GCL-3 
198 
Documentary evidence 
A "document" means any matter expressed or described upon any substance by 
means of letters, figures or marks, or by more than one of those means, intended to 
be used, or which may be used for the purpose of recording that matter. Documents 
produced for the inspection of the Court is called Documentary Evidence. Section 60 
provides that the contents of a document must be proved either by primary or by 
secondary evidence. 
Primary evidence 
"Primary evidence" means the document itself produced for the 
inspection of the Court (Section 62). The rule that the best evidence 
must be given of which the nature of the case permits has often been 
regarded as expressing the great fundamental principles upon which 
the law of evidence depends. The general rule requiring primary evidence of producing 
documents is commonly said to be based on the best evidence principle and to be 
supported by the so called presumption that if inferior evidence is produced where 
better might be given, the latter would tell against the withholder. 
Secondary evidence 
Secondary evidence is generally in the form of compared copies, 
certified copies or copies made by such mechanical processes as in 
themselves ensure accuracy. Section 63 defines the kind of 
secondary evidence permitted by the Act. According to Section 63, 
"secondary evidence" means and includes. 
 
(1) certified copies given under the provisions hereafter contained;  
 
(2) copies made from the original by mechanical processes which in themselves 
ensure the accuracy of the copy, and copies compared with such copies;  
 
(3) copies made from or compared with the original;  
 
(4) counterparts of documents as against the parties who did not execute them;  
 
(5) oral accounts of the contents of a document given by some person who has 
himself seen it.  
Illustrations 
(a) A photograph of an original is secondary evidence of its contents, though the 
two have not been compared, if it is proved that the thing photographed was the 
original.  
(b) A copy compared with a copy of a letter made by a copying machine is 
secondary evidence of the contents of the letter if it is shown that the copy made by 
the copying machine was made from the original.  
Section 65 stipulates the cases in which secondary evidence relating to 
documents may be given. As already stated, documents must be proved by primary 
evidence but in certain cases for example, where the document is lost or destroyed or 
the original is of such a nature as not to be easily, movable, or consists of numerous 
documents, or is a public document or under some law by a certified copy, the 
existence, condition or contents of the document may be proved by secondary 
evidence. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3

? 
Special Provisions as to Evidence Relating to Electronic Record  
Section 65A provides that the contents of electronic records may be proved in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 65B. 
Under Section 65B(1) any information contained in an electronic record which is 
printed on a paper, stored, recorded or copied in optical or magnetic media produced 
by a computer (hereinafter referred to as the computer output) shall be deemed to be 
also a document, if the conditions mentioned in this Section are satisfied in relation to 
the information and computer in question and shall be admissible in any proceedings, 
without further proof or production of the original, as evidence of any contents of the 
original or of any fact stated therein of which direct evidence would be admissible. 
The conditions in respect of a computer output related above, have been stipulated 
under Section 65B(2) of the Evidence Act. 
Circumstantial evidence 
In English law the expression direct evidence is used to signify evidence relating 
to the ‗fact in issue‘ (factum probandum) whereas the terms circumstantial evidence, 
presumptive evidence and indirect evidence are used to signify evidence which 
relates only to "relevant fact" (facta probandum). However, under Section 60 of the 
Evidence Act, the expression "direct evidence" has altogether a different meaning 
and it is not intended to exclude circumstantial evidence of things which could be 
seen, heard or felt. Thus, evidence whether direct or circumstantial under English law 
is "direct" evidence under Section 60. Before acting on circumstances put forward are 
satisfactorily proved and whether the proved circumstances are sufficient to bring the 
guilt to the accused the Court should not view in isolation the circumstantial evidence 
but it must take an overall view of the matter. 
 
Test your knowledge 
What are the two broad rules regarding oral evidence? 
 
(a) It must be direct in all cases. 
 
(b) All facts except the contents of documents may be proved by oral 
evidence. 
 
(c) The contents of documents must be stated orally. 
 
(d) It can be indirect. 
Correct answer: (a) and (b) 
 
7. PRESUMPTIONS  
The Act recognises some rules as to presumptions. Rules of presumption are 
deduced from enlightened human knowledge and experience and are drawn from the 
connection, relation and coincidence of facts and circumstances. A presumption is 
not in itself an evidence but only makes a prima facie case for the party in whose 
favour it exists. A presumption is a rule of law that courts or juries shall or may draw a 
particular inference from a particular fact or from particular evidence unless and untill 
the truth of such inference is disproved. There are three categories of presumptions: 
 
(i) presumptions of law, which is a rule of law that a particular inference shall 
be drawn by a court from particular circumstances.  
EP-GCL-3 
200 
 
(ii) presumptions of fact, it is a rule of law that a fact otherwise doubtful may be 
inferred from a fact which is proved.  
 
(iii) mixed presumptions, they consider mainly certain inferences between the 
presumptions of law and presumptions of fact.  
The terms presumption of law and presumption of fact are not defined by the Act. 
Section 4 only refers to the terms "conclusive proof", "shall presume" and "may 
presume". The term "conclusive proof" specifies those presumptions which in English 
Law are called irrebuttable presumptions of law; the term "shall presume" indicates 
rebuttable presumptions of law; the term "may presume" indicates presumptions of fact. 
When we see a man knocked down by a speeding car and a few yards away, there is a 
car going, there is a presumption of fact that the car has knocked down the man. 
8. ESTOPPEL  
The general rule of estoppel is when one person has by his declaration, act or 
omission, intentionally caused or permitted another person to believe a thing to be 
true and to act upon such belief, neither he nor his representative shall be allowed, in 
any suit or proceeding between himself and such person or his representative to 
deny the truth of that thing (Section 115). However, there is no estoppel against the 
Statute. Where the Statute prescribes a particular way of doing something, it has to 
be done in that manner only. Other relevant Sections are Sections 116 and 117. 
Principle of Estoppel 
Estoppel is based on the maxim ‗allegans contratia non est audiendus‘ i.e. a 
person alleging contrary facts should not be heard. The principles of estoppel covers 
one kind of facts. It says that man cannot approbate and reprobate, or that a man 
cannot blow hot and cold, or that a man shall not say one thing at one time and later 
on say a different thing. 
The doctrine of estoppel is based on the principle that it would be most 
inequitable and unjust that if one person, by a representation made, or by conduct 
amounting to a representation, has induced another to act as he would not otherwise 
have done, the person who made the representation should not be allowed to deny or 
repudiate the effect of his former statement to the loss and injury of the person who 
acted on it (Sorat Chunder v. Gopal Chunder). 
Estoppel is a rule of evidence and does not give rise to a cause of action. 
Estoppel by record results from the judgement of a competent Court (Section 40, 41). 
It was laid down by the Privy Council in Mohori Bibee v. Dharmodas Ghosh, (1930) 
30 Cal. 530 PC, that the rule of estoppel does not apply where the statement is made 
to a person who knows the real facts represented and is not accordingly misled by it. 
The principle is that in such a case the conduct of the person seeking to invoke rule 
of estoppel is in no sense the effect of the representation made to him. The main 
determining element is not the effect of his representation or conduct as having 
induced another to act on the faith of such representation or conduct. 
In Biju Patnaik University of Tech. Orissa v. Sairam College, AIR 2010 (NOC) 
691 (Orissa), one private university permitted to conduct special examination of 
students prosecuting studies under one time approval policy. After inspection, 67 
students were permitted to appear in the examination and their results declared. 
However, university declined to issue degree certificates to the students on the 
ground that they had to appear for further examination for another condensed course 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
201 
? 
as per syllabus of university. It was held that once students appeared in an 
examination and their results declared, the university is estopped from taking 
decision withholding degree certificate after declaration of results. 
There are different kinds of estoppel by conduct or estoppel in pais. They are: (a) 
estoppel by attestation (b) estoppel by contract (c) constructive estoppel (d) estoppel by 
election (e) equitable estoppel (f) estoppel by negligence, and (g) estoppel by silence.

LESSON ROUND-UP 
 
 
The expression ‗specific relief‘ means a relief in specie. It is a remedy which aims 
at the exact fulfillment of an obligation. 
 
The specific Relief Act applies both to movable and immovable property. The Act 
applies in cases where court can order specific performance of a contract or act. 
As per the Act, specific relief can be granted only for the purpose of enforcing 
individual civil rights and not for the mere purpose of enforcing a civil law. 
 
Arbitration is the means by which parties to a dispute get the same settled 
through the intervention of a third person (or more persons) but without recourse 
to a court of law.  
 
The purpose of Arbitration Act is to provide quick redressal to commercial 
disputes by private arbitration. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 aims at 
streamlining the process of arbitration and facilitating conciliation in business 
matters.  
 
The Act has been divided into four parts and contains three Schedules. Part one 
deals with Arbitration; Part two deals with enforcement of certain Foreign Awards; 
Part three deals with conciliation; and Part four contains supplementary 
provisions.  
 
Similarly schedule one contains provisions relating to convention on the 
Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards; Schedule two deals 
with Protocol on Arbitration Clauses and Schedule three contains provisions 
relating to Execution of Foreign Arbitral Awards. 
 
The present Act is based on model law drafted by United Nations Commission on 
International Trade Laws (UNCITRAL), both on domestic arbitration as well as 
EP-GCL-3 
202 
international commercial arbitration, to provide uniformity and certainty to both 
categories of cases. 
 
The essential purpose of a limitation period is to place a time limit on the period 
within which a party can commence legal proceedings. 
 
Limitation periods are imposed by statute, primarily the Limitation Act 1963. The 
Limitation Act provides different limitation periods for different types of suits. 
 
If a limitation period has expired for a particular claim, the claim will be "statute-
barred". This means that it will no longer be possible for the claimant to effect 
recovery for that claim against the alleged wrongdoer. 
 
The law of Evidence may be defined as a system of rules for ascertaining 
controverted questions of fact in judicial inquiries. This system of ascertaining the 
facts, which are the essential elements of a right or liability and is the primary and 
perhaps the most difficult function of the court, is regulated by a set of rules and 
principles known as law of Evidence‖. 
 
The word evidence in the Act signifies only the instruments by means of which 
relevant facts are brought before the court, viz., witnesses and documents, and 
by means of which the court is convinced of these facts. 
 
Evidence under the Act may be either oral or personal (i.e. all statements which 
the court permits or requires to be made before it by witnesses), and 
documentary (documents produced for the inspection of the court), which may be 
adduced in order to prove a certain fact (principal fact) which is in issue.  
 
‗Tort‘ means wrong. But every wrong or wrongful act is not a tort. Tort is really a 
kind of civil wrong as opposed to criminal wrong. Wrongs, in law, are either public 
or private. 
 
A tort consists of some act or omission done by the defendant (tortfeasor) 
whereby he has without just cause or excuse caused some harm to plaintiff. To 
constitute a tort, there must be: (i) a wrongful act or omission of the defendant;  
(ii) the wrongful act must result in causing legal damage to another; and (iii) the 
wrongful act must be of such a nature as to give rise to a legal remedy.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
The law relating to transfer of property is governed by the Transfer of Property 
Act, 1882. Before this Act came into force there was practically no law as to real 
property in India. Barring few points which were covered by certain Regulations and 
204 
 
EP-GCL-4 
205 
Acts, the Courts in India in the absence of any statutory provisions, applied rules of 
English law as the rule of justice, equity and good conscience. 
The Act was enacted with the object to amend the law relating to the transfer of 
property by act of parties. The Act excludes from its purview the transfers by 
operation of law, i.e. by sale in execution, forfeiture, insolvency or intestate 
succession. The scope of the Act is limited, as it is confined to transfers inter vivos 
and excludes testamentary succession, i.e. transfers by will. 
The very preamble to the Act suggests that it simply defines and amends 
certain parts of the law relating to transfer of property by act of parties, and it does 
not at all profess to be an exhaustive enactment as is revealed by the omission of 
the word “consolidate”. Therefore, the Act leaves the scope for applying rules of 
justice, equity and good conscience if a particular case is not covered by any of the 
provisions of the Act. But if it is covered, the Act must be applied.

2.  IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS 
However, while explaining the provisions of the Act, the terms used are defined 
there itself, yet some of the important terms used under the Act are as follows: 
Instrument  
"Instrument" means a non-testamentary instrument. 
EP-GCL-4 
206 
Attached to the earth 
It means : 
 (a) rooted in the earth, as in the case of trees and shrubs; 
 (b) imbedded in the earth, as in the case of walls or buildings; or 
 (c) attached to what is so embedded for the permanent beneficial enjoyment of 
that to which it is attached. 
Absolute Interest 
When a person owns property, he has an "absolute interest" in the property. 
Ownership consists of a bundle of rights, the right to possession, right to enjoyment 
and right to do anything such as selling, mortgaging or making gift of the property. If 
A is the owner of a land, he has an absolute interest in the land. If A sells his land 
to B, then B becomes the owner and he acquires an absolute interest in the land he 
has purchased from A. Likewise if A makes a gift of his property to B, there again B 
gets an absolute interest in the property which is gifted to him. These are instances 
where persons may have an absolute interest. 
Reversion and Remainder 
Some interests in the property are called in English Law, reversion and 
remainders. A "reversion" is the residue of an original interest which is left after the 
grantor has granted the lessee a small estate. For example, A, the owner of a land 
may lease it to B for a period of five years. The person who grants the lease is the 
lessor and the person who takes the lease is called the lessee. Here, after the 
period of 5 years the lease will come to an end and the property reverts back to the 
lessor. The property which reverts back to him is called the reversion or the 
reversionery interest. The grantor has a larger and an absolute interest out of which 
he carves out a smaller estate and gives to the grantee, i.e. the lessee. 
When the owner of the property grants a limited interst in favour of a person or 
persons and gives the remaining to others, it is called a "remainder". For instance, A 
the owner of a land transfers property to B for life and then to C absolutely. Here the 
interest in favour of B is a limited interest, i.e., it is only for life. So long as A is alive 
he enjoys the property. He has a limited right since he cannot sell away the property. 
His right is only to enjoy the property. If he sells this interest it will be valid so long as 
he is alive. So after B‟s death the property will go to C, interest is called a remainder. 
In the case of a "remainder", the property will not come back to the owner, but it goes 
over to the other person. 
Vested and Contingent Interests 
The word "vested" is used in two different senses. It may mean "vested in 
possession" or "vested in interest". A right is said to be "vested in possession" when it 
is a right to present possession of property and it is said to be "vested in interest" 
when it is not a right to present possession but a present right to future possession. 
For instance, if a land is given to A for life with a remainder to B, A‟s right is vested in 
possession, B‟s right is vested in interest. In the above example, the interest of B is 
not subject to any uncertain condition. It will come into his possession after A‟s life 
 
EP-GCL-4 
207 
comes to an end. Therefore, an interest is said to be vested when it is not subject to 
any condition, precedent, i.e., when it is to take effect on the happening of an event 
which is certain, whereas an estate is contingent when the right to enjoyment 
depends upon the happening of an event which may or may not happen. Thus, a gift 
to A on the death of B creates a vested interest in A even during the life time of B for 
there is nothing more certain than death. But a gift to A on the marriage of B creates 
a contingent interest, for B may never marry at all but that contingent interest 
becomes vested if and when B marries. 
A vested interest is transferable and heritable. If property is given to A for life and 
afterwards to B, B gets a vested interest and if B transfers this interest to C, C will 
take when the life estate of A comes to an end. B‟s interest, since it is vested, is also 
heritable. Therefore, if B dies during the lifetime of A, C will get the property after the 
death of A. 
A contingent interest, as said above, is an interest which takes effect after the 
condition is satisfied. It is subject to a condition precedent, i.e., unless A marries B‟s 
daughter, he will not get the property. The following example will illustrate this point. 
Property is given to A for life and then to B if he marries C. B should marry C before A 
dies. If he does so, his interest is converted into vested interest. Before B marries C 
his interest is contingent. The contingent interest is not heritable although it is 
transferable. In a vested interest the transfer is complete, but when the interest is 
contingent the transfer depends upon a condition precedent. In a condition precedent 
the estate is not vested in the grantee until the condition is fulfilled. 
Distinction between a vested and a contingent interest:  The following are the 
principal points of distinction between a vested and a contingent interest: 
 
1. When an interest is vested the transfer is complete. It creates an immediate 
proprietory interest in the property though the enjoyment may be postponed 
to a future date. A contingent interest on the other hand is dependant upon 
the fulfilment of some conditions which may or may not happen. In other 
words, in case of vested interest, the owner‟s title is already prefect; in case 
of a contingent interest, the title is as yet imperfect but may become perfect 
on the fulfilment of a stipulated condition. 
 
2. A vested interest takes effect from the date of transfer. A contingent interest 
in order to become vested is conditioned by a contingency which may not 
occur. 
 
3. A vested interest cannot be defeated by the death of the transferee before 
he obtains possession. A contingent interest may fail in case of the death of 
transferee before the fulfilment of condition. 
 
4. Since vested interest is not circumscribed by any limitation which derogates 
from the completeness of the grant, it logically follows that a vested interest 
is transferable as well as heritable. If, therefore, a transferee of the vested 
interest dies before actual enjoyment, it will devolve on his legal heirs. A 
contingent interest, on the other hand, cannot be inherited though it may be 
transferred coupled with limitation regarding fulfilment of a condition.

3.  MOVEABLE AND IMMOVEABLE PROPERTY 
The term “property” signifies the subject matter over which the right of ownership 
or any less right carved out of ownership (e.g. mortgage right) is exercised. The Act 
deals with (i) various specific transfers relating to Immoveable property and (ii) lays 
down general principles relating to transfer of both moveable and immoveable 
property. Chapter II of the Act is divided into two parts. Parts A deals with the rules 
pertaining to both moveable and immoveable property (Section 5 to 37), Part B 
embodies the rules relating to immoveable property (Section 38 to 53A). The other 
chapters of the Act deal with transfers such as sales, mortgages, leases, gifts, 
exchanges and actionable claims. The rules relating to these transactions are 
referred to as rules governing special transfers to immoveable property. The 
fundamental rule relating to all transfers is that a transfer cannot be effected in any 
other way except as prescribed under the Act. Furthermore, the Act states that 
certain kinds of property cannot be transferred at all. 
The first task is to define and distinguish between moveable and immoveable 
property. 
Moveable property 
The Transfer of Property Act does not defines the term "moveable property". 
Therefore, it is to be defined with the help of other statutes. For e.g., it has been 
defined in the General Clauses Act, 1897 as to mean “property of every description 
except immoveable property”. The Registration Act defines "moveable property" to 
include property of every description excluding immoveable property but including 
standing timber, growing crops and grass. 
For the purpose of law, moveable property is sometimes regarded as 
immoveable property. This may happen when a thing of chattel is attached or 
embedded in earth. For instance, if a machinery or a plant is installed on the land, the 
question arises whether the machinery or the plant is moveable property or 
immoveable property. In order to find out whether such a thing or chattel is an 
immoveable property or not, it is to find out the mode of annexation of the thing and 
the object or purpose of such annexation. If the machinery is fixed on the land 
permanently then it becomes immoveable property, whereas if the machinery or 
engine or any other thing is fixed on a temporary basis, then it will be regarded as 
moveable property. Thus, where the owner of a piece of land installed a bone mill 
 
EP-GCL-4 
209 
along with machinery being held by iron bars which have been dug to a considerable 
depth then it is a permanent fixture and this will become immoveable property. 
Similarly, the machinery installed on a cement platform and held in position by being 
attached to iron pillars fixed in the ground was held to be immoveable property as the 
annexation was made by the person who owned the buildings as well as the 
machinery (Mohamed Ibrahim v. Northern Circars Fibre Trading Company, A.I.R. 
1944 Mad. 492). 
Immoveable property 
The term “immoveable property” is also not defined under the Act. However, it is 
defined in the negative sense as “the immoveable property does not include standing 
timber, growing crops, or grass” (S. 3 Para 2). Standing timber are trees fit for use for 
building or repairing houses. This is an exception to the general rule that growing 
trees are immoveable property. 
Growing crops:  It includes all vegetable growths which have no existence apart 
form their produce such as pan leaves, sugar cane etc. 
Grass:  Grass is moveable property, but if it is a right to cut grass it would be an 
interest in land and hence forms immoveable property. 
The General Clauses Act defines the term "immoveable property" but not 
exhaustively. It states: “immoveable property shall include land, benefits to arise out 
of land and things attached to the earth, or permanently fastened to any thing 
attached to the earth” [Section 3(25)]. The Indian Registration Act expressly includes 
under to immoveable property the benefits to arise out of land, hereditary allowances, 
rights of way, lights, ferries and fisheries. 
If the definitions of "immoveable property" as given in the Transfer of Property 
Act, the General Clauses Act and the Registration Act are viewed together, it is 
evident that they do not say what immoveable property is. They only say what is 
either included or excluded therein. Still, reading the definition in the Act with one in 
the General Clauses Act, immoveable property will be found to include land, benefit 
to arise out of land such as rent, and things attached to the earth like trees and 
buildings but not standing timber, growing crops and grass. The last three things are 
regarded as severable from the land on which they stand and, therefore, they are not 
included in the term "immoveable property". 
Thus, the meaning of immoveable property is as under: 
"Immoveable property" means land, benefits to arise out of land, 
and things attached to the earth, or permanently fastened to anything 
attached to the earth. 
“Attached to the earth” means (a) rooted in the earth, as in the case of trees and 
shrubs; (b) embedded in the earth, as in the case of walls or buildings; or (c) attached 
to what is so embedded for the permanent beneficial enjoyment of that to which it is 
attached (S. 3 Para 6 of the Act). 
Things rooted in the earth:  Trees and Shrubs are immoveable property 
according to this definition subject to the exception as to standing timber. 
EP-GCL-4 
210 
Things embedded in the earth:  A house being embedded in the earth is 
immoveable property and this is so even if it is sold for enjoyment as a house with an 
option to pull it down. The mode of annexation and object of annexation are the two 
tests to determine whether it is immoveable property or not. 
Attached to what is so...:  The attachment must be as the Section says for the 
permanent beneficial enjoyment of that to which it is attached e.g. the doors, windows 
of a house or moveable parts of fixed machinery. But the attachment must be 
intended to be permanent. 
A orally grants to B for Rs. 700/- the rights to catch and carry away fish from his 
lake. Is the grant valid? The Supreme Court in Ananda Behra v. State of Orissa, 
(1956) SCJ p. 96, that such a right is a benefit arising out of immoveable property 
namely the lake. So under General Clauses Act it is immoveable property. The sale 
requires a registered instrument for its validity under Section 54 of the Transfer of 
Property Act. Therefore, the oral grant is invalid and cannot pass away any title in 
favour of B. 
Distinction between moveable and immoveable property 
The distinction between moveable and immoveable property was explained in 
the case of Sukry Kurdepa v. Goondakull, (1872) 6 Mad. H.C. 
71, by Holloway J. as moveability may be defined to be a 
capacity in a thing of suffering alteration. Immoveablity for 
such alteration e.g., a piece of land in all circumstances is 
immoveable. If a thing cannot change its place without 
injury to the quality it is immoveable. Certain things e.g. 
trees attached to the ground are so long as they are so 
attached, immoveable when the severance has been effected they become 
moveable. 
The following have been recognised as immoveable property: 
 (a) right to collect rents of immoveable property; 
 (b) a right to way; 
 (c) a right to collect dues from fair on a piece of land; 
 (d) hereditary offices; 
 (e) the equity of redemption; 
 
(f) the interest of mortgagee; 
 (g) right to collect lac from trees; 
 (h) a right of ferry; 
 
(i) a right of fishery; 
 
(j) right to receive future rents and profits of land; 
 (k) reversion in property leased; 
 
(l) a factory. 
The following have been held not to be immoveable property: 
 (a) right of worship; 
 
EP-GCL-4 
211 
? 
 (b) government promissory notes; 
 (c) royalty; 
 (d) a right to recover maintenance allowance; 
 (e) copyright; 
 
(f) a decree for sale on a mortgage-deed; 
 (g) a decree for arrears of rent; 
 (h) a machinery which is not permanently attached to earth; 
 
(i) standing timber, growing crop and grass.

 (a) Growing trees 
 (b) Standing timber 
 (c) Growing crops 
 (d) Grass 
Correct Answer: (b), (c) and (d) 
 
4. RULES RELATING TO TRANSFER OF PROPERTY (WHETHER MOVEABLE 
OR IMMOVEABLE) 
According to Section 5 of the Transfer of Property Act, the term “transfer of 
property” means an act by which a living person conveys property in present, or in 
future, to one or more other living persons, or to himself, and one or more other living 
persons and "to transfer property" is to perform such an act. In this section, "living 
person" includes a company or association or body of individuals whether 
incorporated or not. But the general provisions of the Act as to transfer do not effect 
the special provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. 
To effect a transfer, property must be in existence. The word “transfer” is defined 
with reference to the word “convey”. The fundamental rule is that a transfer cannot be 
affected in any way not prescribed by the Act. 
The first point to note is that transfer inter vivos (i.e., between living persons) 
alone is contemplated by the Act. A transfer by means of a will is not a transfer 
according to the Act, because it is not a transfer between two living persons. Section 
5 also says that the transfer may be “in present or in future”. The words in present or 
in future qualify the words „conveys‟, and not the word „property‟. A transfer of 
property not in existence operates as a contract to be performed in future 
which may be specially enforced as soon as the property comes into existence 
(Jugalkishore v. Ram Cotton Company, (1955) I SCR 1369). 
Further Section 6 (h) provides that no transfer can be made in so far as it is 
opposed to the nature of the interest attached thereby or for an unlawful object or 
consideration or to a person legally disqualified to be a transferee. 
EP-GCL-4 
212 
5.  WHO CAN TRANSFER THE PROPERTY? 
According to Section 7 of the Transfer of Property Act, every person who is 
competent to contract and entitled to transferable property, or authorised to dispose 
of property is competent to transfer such property. Hence, every person competent to 
contract and having ownership can trasnfer property. According to Indian Contract 
Act, a person is competent to contract when he is a major and of sound mind and is 
not disqualified from contracting by any law to which he is subject. But a minor can be 
a transferee as there is nothing in the Transfer of Property Act to disqualify a person, 
who is a minor to be a transferee. Thus, a mortgage can be validly executed in favour 
of a minor who has paid the consideration (Hari Mohan v. Mohini, 22 C.W.C. 130, 
Raghava v. Srinivasa, (1917) 60 Mad. 308). Persons who are authorised to transfer 
property can also transfer property validly. Although a minor is not competent to be a 
transferor yet a transfer to a minor is valid. However, there are exceptions to this: 
If a person holds himself out is the owner with the consent of the owner i.e. 
doctrine of holding out or if a person represents to be the owner i.e. doctrine of 
feeding the grant by estoppel. 
6.  SUBJECT MATTER OF TRANSFER 
Section 6 of the Transfer of Property Act says that property of any kind may be 
transferred except as provided by this Act or any other law for the time being in force. 
The words “property of any kind” indicate that transferability is the general rule and 
the right to property includes the right to transfer the property to another person. 
Property of any kind excludes from its purview the future property. A transfer of future 
property can only operate as a contract which may be specifically performed when 
the property comes into existence. 
Exceptions to the general rule of transferability made by other laws 
Certain restrictions are placed by Hindu law and Mohammedan law on the 
transfer of property. 
7.  FORMALITIES OF TRANSFER 
Property can be transferred either orally or by writing. Moveable property can be 
transferred by delivery of possession or by registration. Section 54 lays down the 
mode of transfer of immoveable property. Such transfer, in the case of tangible 
immoveable property of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards, or in the case 
of a reversion or other intangible thing, can be made only by a registered instrument. 
In the case of tangible immoveable property of a value less than one hundred 
rupees, such transfer may be made either by a registred instrument or by delivery of 
the property. 
The tangible property means a property which can be touched physically and 
hence, capable of physical dealing. 
The intangible property means something in abstract, either capable of being 
touched or perceived and yet standing in relation to a certain thing. 
„Reversion‟ means the bundle of rights remaining with the lessor after the 
execution of a lease of a certain immoveable property. 
 
EP-GCL-4 
213 
When a transfer is effected in writing, the person who signs the document 
professing to transfer the property is called the executant. Execution consists in 
affixing his signature to the document to the effect that he is transferring the property. 
An illiterate person who cannot write may direct some literate person to sign it on his 
behalf and in his presence and the illiterate person may put his thumb impression. 
(i)  Attestation 
Attestation is an important formality in connection with the execution of transfer. 
"Attest" means to testify a factor, to bear witness to a fact. Attestation, in relation to a 
document, signifies the fact of authentication of the signature of the executant of that 
document by the attestator by putting down his own signature on the document in 
testimony of the fact of its execution. All transfers do not require attestation. For 
example, a sale or a lease does not require attestation. But a mortgage or a gift 
requires that a mortgage deed or a gift deed must be attested by two or more 
witnesses. 
Attestation is valid and complete when two witnesses sign the instrument. 
According to the definition given in the Transfer of Property Act (Section 3), the 
following essentials are required for a valid attestation: 
 (a) There must be at least two or more witnesses; 
 (b) Each witness must see (a) the executant‟s sign or affix his mark to the 
instrument, or (b) some other person sign the instrument in the presence 
and by the direction of the executant, or (c) receive from the executant a 
personal acknowledgement of his signature or mark or of the signature of 
such other person; and 
 (c) Each witness must sign the instrument, (i.e. document), in the presence of 
the executant. 
It is not necessary that both attesting witnesses should be present at the same 
time. The instrument may be attested after its execution by each of the attestators at 
different times. Attestation cannot take place before the execution of the deed. The 
Act does not insist on any particular form of attestation. The attesting witness may not 
be described as such on the face of the document (Yakub v. Kalzurkan, 52 Bombay 
203). However, the attesting witness must have put his signature antmus attestandi, 
i.e., with intention to attest. Thus, where a Register or an identifying witness puts his 
signature on the document he cannot be regarded as an attesting witness unless it is 
duly proved that he signed with the necessary intention to attest. 
(ii)  Registration 
Registration is an essential legal formality to effect a valid transfer in certain 
cases. The advantage of registering a document is that any person who deals with 
the property would be bound by the rights that are created in earlier registered 
document. 
Illustration 
A executes a mortgage on property X and gets it registered. Subsequently he 
sells property X to B, B is bound by the right of the mortgagee over the property X. 
Thus, whether B knows actually or not that there was a mortgage the fact that the 
EP-GCL-4 
214 
earlier document was registered is a notice to B and B takes property, subject to the 
rights of the mortgagee. Therefore, if a document of transfer relating to immoveable 
property is required by the law to be and has been effected by registered instrument, 
the persons who deal with the property subsequently are deemed in the eye of law as 
having knowledge of the such registered instrument from the date of its registration. 
(iii)  Notice 
Notice, may be actual or constructive. If a person knows about a fact, he has an 
actual notice. But, in certain circumstances law treats a man who ought to have 
known a fact even though he did not in fact know it. This is called constructive notice. 
The equitable doctrine of notice is recognised in various Sections of this Act. For 
instance in Section 39 of the Act, where a transfer is made of property out of which a 
person has a right to receive maintenance, the transferee takes subject to that right if 
he had notice of it, but not otherwise. Similarly under Section 40 if A conveys to C 
property, which he had by a previous contract agreed to sell to B, then B can enforce 
the contract against C, if C had notice of it, but not otherwise. If C had notice of the 
prior contract, he purchases with knowledge that it was unconscionable of A to sell to 
him, and it is therefore, unconscionable of him to buy. 
A person is deemed in the eye of law to have constructive notice of a fact when 
(i) but for willful absentation from an enquiry or search which he ought reasonably to 
have made; or (ii) gross negligence on his part, he would have known it. Constructive 
notice arises from an irrefutable presumption of notice. In law such a presumption will 
arise when (i) there is a willful absentation on the part of a person to make necessary 
enquiries regarding the existence of certain facts, or (ii) he showed gross negligence 
in the matter. 
The words “wilful absentation” suggest want of bona fide in respect of 
particular transaction (Joshua v. Alliance Bank, 22 Cal. 185). Thus, a person 
who refuses to receive a registered letter is, deemed to have constructive 
notice of its contents. 
Similarly, if a person proposes to sell his property to X who, at the same time 
knows that rents due in respect of the property are paid by the tenants to a third person 
Y, X will be fixed with notice of the rights of Y (Mernt v. Luck (1902) 1 Ch. 429). 
In so far as gross negligence is concerned, it does not mean a mere 
carelessness but means carelessness of such an aggravated nature as to indicate 
mental indifference to obvious risks. For example, if A buys property from B and does 
not care to ask whether any amount by way of municipal tax is due on that property 
and if the municipal corporation asks him to pay the arrears of tax, then B is 
responsible, and if he does not pay, then the arrears of tax may be made a charge on 
the property.

8.  RESTRAINT ON TRANSFERS OR RULE AGAINST INALIENABILITY 
Section 10 of the Act says that when property is transferred, the transferee 
should not be restrained absolutely from alienating the property. One may give 
property to another subject to a condition, but the condition should not be one which 
absolutely prevents the transferee from alienating the property. Suppose, B gives 
property to A and his heirs adding a condition that if the property is alienated it should 
revert to B. This condition is invalid and the transferee can ignore such condition. The 
transfer takes effect and is valid, and the condition not to alienate the property is void. 
Examples of absolute restraint 
Suppose, A gives to B property worth only 2,000 rupees and adds a condition 
that B should sell property for Rs. 50,000 and not below that amount, this condition 
will at once become invalid for no one will buy the property which is only worth Rs. 
2,000 for Rs. 50,000. Similarly, A gives to B property worth Rs. 50,000 and stipulates 
that if B wants to sell the property he should sell it to C only for Rs. 1,000. This again 
will operate as an absolute restraint. In Rosher v. Rosher, (1884) 26, Ch. D. 801, the 
testator gave his estate to his son and added a condition that if his son wanted to sell 
the property he should first give an option to the testator‟s wife who should be able to 
buy for £ 3,000. The market value of the property when the testator died was £ 
15,000. It was held by the Court that the condition which compelled the son to sell the 
property for £ 3,000 was void. In Trichinpoly Varthaga Sangum v. Shunmoga 
Sunderam, (1939) Madras 954, there was a partition between a Hindu father and 
his five sons. The deed of partition provided that if any one of the sons wanted 
to sell his share, he should not sell it to a stranger but to one of his brothers 
who should have the option to buy for a sum not exceeding Rs. 1,000. It was 
held by the Court that the condition absolutely prevented the son from selling 
the property to any one for good value. In this case the market value of the 
EP-GCL-4 
216 
property of the son was far greater than Rs. 1,000. Hence, the condition was 
declared invalid. 
Partial restraint valid 
Though absolute restraints are bad in law, partial restraints are valid. If there are 
conditions which restrain the transferee not to alienate the property outside the 
family, it has been held by the Courts that they are partial restraints. For example, 
whenever there are conditions in a family settlement whereby the members are not 
allowed to sell their shares to a stranger, such conditions are valid. 
But it is not permissible to restrict the alienation to a particular time. Such a 
restriction is not partial but an absolute restraint and as such invalid. 
When absolute restraint valid? 
There are two exceptions to the rule that absolute restraints are void. Firstly, in 
the case of a lease, the lessor can impose a condition that the lessee shall not sublet 
the property or sell his leasehold interest. Such conditions are valid. The reason why 
such an exception is made in the case of a lease is that the lessor may have 
confidence in the lessee but may not have the same confidence in some other 
person. So, if the lessor puts a condition restraining the lessee from transferring the 
property to someone, the condition is valid. 
The second exception is made in respect of a woman who is not a Hindu, 
Buddhist or Muslim. In such a case, a condition to the effect that she shall not have 
power during her marriage to transfer the property is valid. 
Restraint on enjoyment 
Section 11 of the Act also embodies a rule which is based on the principle that 
restraint on the enjoyment of the property is invalid. The section lays down that where 
land is transferred by one to another, the transferor should not impose conditions as 
to how and in what manner the transferee should enjoy the property. 
Illustrations 
(a) A sells his house to B and adds a condition that B only should reside in that 
house, the condition is invalid. This is subject to the exception that, if a person 
transfers a plot of land keeping another plot for himself, he can impose certain 
conditions which may interfere with the right of enjoyment of the transferee. 
(b) A has properties X and Y. He sells property Y to B and puts a condition that 
B should not construct on property Y more than one storey so that A‟s property X 
which he retains should have good light and free air. 
Thus, it is clear in the above illustration that the condition which is imposed by A 
is for the benefit of another property which he retains. Such a condition is valid. 
Section 12 also makes the transfer void if a property is transferred to any person 
adding a condition that if such person becomes insolvent he ceases to hold that 
property. Such a condition is not recognised as valid in law. Again, this is subject to 
the exception that if a landlord leases his property he can impose a condition on the 
lessee that if the lessee becomes insolvent the lease should come to an end.

9.  TRANSFER FOR BENEFIT OF UNBORN PERSON 
Section 13 of the Transfer of Property Act lays down that where on a transfer of 
property, an interest therein is created for the benefit of a person not in existence at 
the date of transfer, subject to a prior interest created by the same transfer, the 
interest created for the benefit of such person shall not take effect unless it extends to 
the whole of the remaining interest of the transferor in the property. Thus if a property 
is given to an unborn person, two conditions should be satisfied: 
 
(i) it should be preceded by a life estate in favour of a living person, and 
 (ii) it should comprise the whole of the remaining interest of the transferor so 
that there can be no further interest in favour of others. 
Illustration 
A transfers property of which he is the owner to B in trust for A and his intended 
wife successively for their lives, and after the death of the survivor, for the eldest son 
of the intended marriage for life, and after his death for A‟s second son. The interest 
so created for the benefit of the eldest son does not take effect, because it does not 
extend to the whole of A‟s remaining interest in the property.

10.  CONDITIONAL TRANSFER 
When an interest is created on the transfer of property but is made to depend on 
the fulfillment of a condition by the transferee, the transfer is known as a conditional 
transfer. Such a transfer may be subject to a condition precedent or a condition 
subsequent. If the interest is made to accrue on the fulfilment of a condition, the 
condition is said to be condition precedent. For instance, A agrees to sell his land to 
B if B marries C. This is a condition precedent. The condition precedent will be 
allowed to operate only if it is not hit by the provisions of Section 25 of the Act. 
Section 25 in the first place, says that, the condition must not be impossible to fulfil. 
For example, A lets a farm to B on condition that he shall walk a hundred miles in an 
hour. The lease is void. Secondly, the condition must not be forbidden by law. Thirdly, 
it should not be of such a nature that if permitted it would defeat the provisions of any 
law. For instance, A transfers Rs. 500 to B on condition that he shall murder C. The 
transfer is void. Fourthly, it should not be fraudulent. For example, X gives a false 
EP-GCL-4 
218 
receipt to Y on behalf of his principal in consideration of transfer of land. The transfer 
would be void. Fifthly, the condition should not be such as to cause injury to the 
person or property of another. And lastly the condition should not be immoral or 
opposed to public policy. Thus, an agreement to give a son or daughter in adoption 
for a consideration is opposed to public policy as trafficking in children is forbidden by 
law. 
If the condition is not hit by any of the above provisions, it is valid. Still the law 
does not insist on its literal fulfilment. It is sufficient if it is substantially complied with. 
Thus, where A transfers, Rs. 5,000 to B on condition that he shall marry with the 
consent of C, D and E. B marries with the consent of C and D only as E has died 
earlier. B is deemed to have fulfilled the condition. 
A transfer may also be made subject to a contingency which may or may not 
occur. Thus, an interest may be created with the condition superadded that it shall 
cease to exist in case a specified uncertain event shall happen, or in case a specified 
uncertain event shall not happen. 
This is known as condition subsequent. Condition subsequent is one which 
destroys or divests the rights upon the happening or non-happening of an event. For 
example, A transfers a farm to B for his life with a proviso that in case B cuts down a 
certain wood, the transfer shall cease to have any effect. B cuts down the wood. He 
loses his life interest in the farm. Similarly, if A transfers a farm to B provided that B 
shall not go to England within three years after the date of transfer, the interest in the 
farm shall cease. B does not go to England within the term prescribed. His interest in 
the farm ceases. 
Now you will notice the distinction between condition precedent and condition 
subsequent. In condition precedent, the condition comes before the interest; whereas 
in condition subsequent, the interest is created before the condition. The one 
precedes the vesting of right and the other follows the vesting. In condition precedent, 
the vesting of right is delayed until the happening of an event. In condition 
subsequent, there is no postponement of vesting of right though it is to be destroyed 
or divested by reason of non-fulfilment of condition. There are certain situations 
where the law says that either the transfer will take effect on the fulfillment of a 
condition or will not take effect at all. 
Again, if a transfer is made to defeat or delay the rights of a creditor, the transfer 
may be declared invalid by the creditor. In some cases, if property is transferred 
during the period when parties are litigating in a Court over a piece of property, then 
the transfer is not valid, or even if there is a transfer, it is subject to the rights that are 
created in the Court‟s decree. All these circumstances are given in the Transfer of 
Property Act e.g., doctrine of election, doctrine of fraudulent transfers and doctrine of 
Lis pendens. 
11.  DOCTRINE OF ELECTION 
Section 35 of the Transfer of Property Act deals with what is called doctrine of 
election. Suppose, a property is given to you and in the same deed of gift you are 
asked to transfer something belonging to you to another person. If you want to take 
the property you should transfer your property to someone else, otherwise you 
cannot take the property which is transferred to you by some one. Election may be 
 
EP-GCL-4 
219 
defined as “the choosing between two rights where there is a clear intention that both 
were not intended to be enjoyed”. 
The foundation of doctrine of election is that a person taking the benefit of 
an instrument must also bear the burden, and he must not take under and 
against the same instrument. It is, therefore, a branch of a general rule that no 
one may approbate and reprobate (Copper v. Copper (1874) H.L. 53). However 
doctrine of election could not be applied to deprive a person of his statutory 
right to appear invoking extraordinary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under 
Article 136, (PR Deshpande v. MB Haribatti (1995 (2) Scale 804 SC). 
Illustration 
A transfers to you his paddy field and in the same deed of transfer asks you to 
transfer your house to C. Now, if you want to have the paddy field you must transfer 
your house to C, because the transferor is transferring to you his paddy field on the 
condition that you give your house to C. 
Thus, either you take the paddy field and part with your house or do not take it at 
all. This is called the doctrine of election. You must elect either to take under the 
instrument, in which case you will have to fulfil the condition and bear the burden 
imposed upon you or you must elect against the instrument, in which case neither the 
benefit nor the burden will come to you. The doctrine is based on the principle that “a 
donee shall not be allowed to approbate and reprobate and that if he approbates, he 
shall do all in his power to confirm the instrument which he approbates” (Cavendish v. 
Decre 31 C.D. 466). 
In case, the person upon whom benefit is conferred rejects it, the property which 
was attempted to be transferred to him will revert to the transferor and it is he who will 
compensate the disappointed person. If the transferor dies before the person upon 
whom the benefit is conferred and he rejects the transfer, then the representatives of 
the transferor will have to satisfy the disappointed person out of the property which 
was the subject of transfer. 
Explanation of the above principle 
A transfers his property worth Rs. 1,000 and by the same instrument asks B to 
transfer his property worth Rs. 500 to C. Here, if B does not accept, he will not take 
A‟s property and the property will revert to A. If A is alive, it is for him to give some 
property to C. But if A dies before B has made his election then the heirs of A have to 
compensate C from A‟s property to the extent of Rs. 500. (You will note that B‟s 
property worth Rs. 500 was intended by A to be transferred to C). 
The question of Election arises only when a transfer is made by the same 
document. If the transferor makes a gift of property by one deed and by another asks 
the donee to part with his own property then there is no question of election. 
Illustration 
A transfers his land to B by a document. A by another document transfers B‟s 
property to C. In this case B can retain the property given to him and refuse to 
transfer his property to C as the two transfers do not form part of the same document. 
EP-GCL-4 
220 
? 
Further, the doctrine of election is applicable if the benefit is given directly. A 
person taking no benefit directly under a transaction but deriving a benefit under it 
indirectly need not elect. 
Illustration 
A transfers his property to B‟s son and by the same instrument transfer B‟s 
property to C. In this case B need not to elect and can keep his property. His son can 
have his gift. 
There is, however, an exception to the doctrine of election. That is, if the 
transferor gives two benefits to a person and one particular benefit is in lieu of an 
item of property belonging to that person which the transferor has asked to transfer to 
a third-party then if the person elects to retain his property, he can retain the other 
benefit. 
Illustration 
Under A‟s marriage settlement, his wife is entitled, if she survives him to the 
enjoyment of the estate of Sultanpur during her life. A by his will bequeaths to his wife 
an annuity of Rs. 200 p.m. during her life, in lieu of her interest in the estate of 
Sultanpur, which estates he bequeaths to his son. A also gives his wife a legacy of 
Rs. 1,000. After the death of A, his widow elects to take what she is entitled to take 
under the marriage settlement (i.e., the enjoyment of estate of Sultanpur). In this 
case, the wife has to forfeit the claim of Rs. 200 which her husband has given to her. 
But she can claim other benefit i.e., Rs. 1,000. 
Election may be express or implied by conduct. 
Illustration 
A transfers to B an estate to which C is entitled, and as part of the same 
transaction gives C a coal mine. C takes possession of the mine and exhausts it. He 
has thereby confirmed the transfer. 
In case of disability, the condition shall be postponed until the disability ceases, 
or until the election is made by some competent authority.

12.  TRANSFER BY OSTENSIBLE OWNER OR DOCTRINE OF HOLDING OUT 
Where, with the consent, express or implied, of the persons interested in 
immoveable property, a person is the ostensible owner of such property and transfers 
the same for consideration, the transfer shall not be voidable on the ground that the 
transferor was not authorised to make it, provided that the transferee, after taking 
reasonable care to ascertain that the transferor had power to make the transfer, has 
acted in good faith. (Section 41) 
 
EP-GCL-4 
221 
The following conditions are necessary for the application of Section 41: 
 
(i) the transferor is the ostensible owner; 
 (ii) he is so by the consent, express or implied, of the real owner; 
 (iii) the transfer is for consideration, and 
 (iv) the transferee has acted in good faith taking reasonable care to ascertain 
that the transferor had power to transfer. 
If any one of these elements is absent, the transferee is not entitled to the 
protection of this section. 
This Section is a statutory application of the law of estoppel. The section makes 
an exception to the rule that a person cannot confer a better title than he has. An 
ostensible owner is one who has all the indicia of ownership without being the real 
owner. 
Illustrations 
 (a) A made a gift of property to B but continued in possession of the gifted 
property. He purported to exercise a power of revocation and then 
transferred the property to the defendant. The gift, however, was not 
revocable as it was an unconditional gift. B seeks to recover possession 
from the defendant. The defendant invoked protection under Section 41.  
 
 In the given example, the donor is not an „ostensible owner‟ holding the 
property with the consent of the real owner. The defendant cannot, 
therefore, invoke the protection of Section 41. 
 (b) The manager of a joint Hindu family consisting of some minor members 
alienated the ancestral house to P without any necessity and the alienee 
transferred it to the defendants. The minors challenged the alienation. The 
defendants sought protection under Section 41. 
Here Section 41 has no application for “P was not the ostensible owner of the 
ancestral family house with the consent, express or, implied, of the persons 
interested in the said ancestral house in as much as the plaintiff, who had an interest 
in the said house, did not and could not by reason of the disability of infancy give their 
consent”. 
13.  DOCTRINE OF FEEDING THE GRANT BY ESTOPPEL 
Where, a person fraudulently or erroneously represents that he is authorised to 
transfer certain immoveable property and professes to transfer such property for 
consideration, such transfer shall, at the option of the transferee, operate on any 
interest which the transferor may acquire in such property at any time during which 
the contract of transfer subsists. (Section 43) 
Nothing in this Section shall impair the right of transferees in good faith for 
consideration without notice of the existence of the said option. 
Essentials: In order to invoke this section, the transferee must prove that: 
 
1. there was a representation, fraudulent or erroneous; 
 
2. it was to the effect that the transferor is entitled to transfer the immoveable 
property; 
EP-GCL-4 
222 
 
3. the transferor is found to have subsequently acquired the interest which he 
professed to transfer; 
 
4. the transfer of property was for consideration; 
 
5. the transferee has not rescinded the contract; 
 
6. the transferee acted in good-faith for consideration and without notice of the 
rights under the prior transfer. 
Illustration 
A, a Hindu, who has separated from his father B, sells to C three fields, X, Y and 
Z, representing that A is authorised to transfer the same. Of these fields, Z does not 
belong to A, it having been retained by B on the partition, but on B‟s dying, A as heir 
obtains Z. C, not having rescinded the contract of sale may require A to deliver Z to 
him. Thus, where a grantor has purported to grant an interest in land which he did not 
at that time possess, but subsequently acquires, the benefit of his subsequent 
acquisition goes automatically to the earlier grantee or as it usually expressed, feeds 
the estoppel. 
14.  DOCTRINE OF FRAUDULENT TRANSFER 
Where a person transfers his property so that his creditors shall not have 
anything out of the property, the transfer is called a fraudulent transfer. A debtor in 
order to defeat or delay the rights of a creditor, may transfer his property to some 
person, who may be his relative or a friend. The law does not allow this. Section 53 
embodies the principle. It states : 
“Every transfer of immoveable property made with intent to defeat or delay the 
creditors of the transferor shall be voidable at the option of any creditor so 
defeated or delayed.” 
Thus, where an owner of the property contracts a debt and then transfers his 
property to someone so that the creditor cannot proceed against the property to 
realise his debt, such a transfer is voidable at the option of the creditor. The transfer 
is valid so long as the creditor does not challenge it in a Court of law and gets a 
declaration that the transfer is invalid. A suit instituted by a creditor to avoid a transfer 
on the ground that it has been made with intent to defeat or delay the creditors of the 
transfer or shall be instituted on behalf of, or for the benefit of all the creditors. Once 
the creditor sues the debtor and says that the debtor has the intention to deceive him, 
the transfer can be declared invalid by the Court. The creditor has to satisfy the Court 
that there was an intention on the part of the debtor to defeat his rights. If he does not 
prove this, then the creditor will fail and the transfer is valid. The question arises as to 
when we can say that the transferor has the necessary intention to defeat the claim of 
the creditor. This can be gathered from the surrounding circumstances. Suppose a 
man takes a loan from the creditor. He does not pay the loan. Then the creditor sues 
him in a Court to get back his debt. On seeing this the debtor transfers his property to 
a friend of his or some other person who simply holds the property on behalf of the 
transferor. Again, the debtor may make a gift of his property to his wife or sell it to a 
friend who will afterwards retransfer the same to the transferor. Under these 
circumstances, we can easily say that the debtor‟s intention was to prevent the 
creditor from taking the property by a suit in the Court and to realise his debt. 
 
EP-GCL-4 
223 
But suppose the debtor has several creditors and he transfers his property to one 
of his creditors in satisfaction of his whole debt to him. Is this also a fraudulent 
transfer? The answer is No. For a mere preference of one creditor over the others is 
not fraudulent under the Section, even if the whole property is so transferred and 
nothing is left for the other creditors. But the other creditors may file a petition in the 
Court within three months of the transfer praying that the debtor be declared 
insolvent. If the debtor is adjudicated an insolvent, their interest will be protected and 
the transfer will be declared as fraudulent preference. The transfer will be set aside 
and the property will be distributed among all the creditors. 
However, under Section 53(2) the rights of a transferee in good-faith and for 
consideration are protected. It says nothing shall affect or impair the rights of a 
transferee in good-faith and for consideration. 
15.  DOCTRINE OF PART-PERFORMANCE 
Lastly, we may also discuss briefly the doctrine of part-performance which is 
embodied in Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act. 
A contract for the sale of land has been entered into between A and B. The 
transferee has paid the price entering into possession and is willing to carry out his 
contractual obligations. As registration has not been effected A, the transferor, seeks 
to evict B from the land. Can he do so? No, B will not be allowed to suffer simply 
because the formality of registration has not been through. The legislature grants 
some relief to such a transferee under Section 53A, which embodies the doctrine of 
part-performance. 
The rule did not exist on the statute book before 1929. Section 53A, 
was inserted by an amendment to the Act in 1929. Followings are the 
essential conditions for the operation of the doctrine of part-
performance according to Section 53A. 
 
1. There must be a contract to transfer immoveable property. 
 
2. It must be for consideration. 
 
3. The contract should be in writing and signed by the transferor himself or on 
his behalf. 
 
4. The terms necessary to constitute the transfer must be ascertainable with 
reasonable certainty from the contract itself. 
 
5. The transferee should have taken the possession of the property in part 
performance of the contract. In case he is already in possession, he must 
have continued in possession in part performance of the contract and must 
have done something in furtherance of the contract. 
 
6. The transferee must have fulfilled or ready to fulfill his part of the obligation 
under the contract. 
If all the abovementioned conditions are satisfied, then, the transferor and the 
persons claiming under him are debarred form exercising any right in relation to the 
property other than the rights expressly provided by the terms of the contract 
notwithstanding the fact that the instrument of transfer has not been registered or 
complete in the manner prescribed therefor by the law for time being in force. It 
EP-GCL-4 
224 
? 
should be noted that Section 53A does not confer any positive right on the transferee. 
It only prohibits exercise of the right of ownership in relation to the property in order to 
evict the transferee from the property because legal requirements have not been 
satisfied. 
However, the doctrine of part-performance will not affect the right of a 
subsequent transferee for consideration without notice of the earlier contract and of 
its being partly performed. 
The right conferred by this section is a right only available to a defendant to 
protect his possession. This section does not create a title on the defendant. It 
merely operates as a bar to the plaintiff asserting his title. It 
is limited to cases where the transferee had taken 
possession, and against whom the transferor is debarred 
from enforcing any right other than that expressly provided 
by the contract. The section imposes a bar on the 
transferor. When the conditions mentioned in the sections 
are fulfilled, it debars him from enforcing against the 
transferee any right or interest expressly provided by the contract. So far as 
the tranferee is concerned, the section confers a right on him to the extent it 
imposes a bar on the transferor (Delhi Motor Co. v. Basurkas, (1968) SCR 720). 
The English rules as to what acts constitute part-performance have been 
generally followed in India. These rules are as follows: 
 (1) An act of part-performance must be an act done in performance of the 
contract. An act introductory to and previous to the agreement, cannot 
therefore, be act of part-performance. 
 (2) The acts relied upon must be unequivocally and referable to no other 
contract than that alleged. 
 (3) An act of part-performance must be the act of the party seeking to avail 
himself of the equity.

16.  PROPERTIES WHICH CANNOT BE TRANSFERRED 
Section 6 of this Act contains some exceptions to the general rule that property of 
any kind may be transferred. Consequently, the following properties cannot be 
transferred, namely: 
 (a) the chance of an heir apparent succeeding to an estate, the chance of a 
relation obtaining a legacy on the death of a kinsman or any other mere 
possibility of a like nature cannot be transferred. 
 
EP-GCL-4 
225 
 (b) A mere right of re-entry for breach of a condition subsequent cannot be 
transferred to any one except the owner of the property affected thereby. 
 (c) An easement cannot be transfered apart from the dominant heritage. 
 (d) An interest is property restricted in its enjoyment to the owner personally 
cannot be transferred by him. 
 (e) A right to future maintenance in whatsoever manner arising, secured or 
determined, cannot be transferred. 
 
(f) A mere right to sue cannot be transferred. 
 (g) A public office cannot be transferred nor can the salary of a public officer, 
whether before or after it has become payable. 
 (h) Stipends allowed to military, naval, air force and civil pensioners of the 
Government and political pensions cannot be transferred. 
(a)  Chance of an heir apparent or „Spes Successionis‟ 
In this clause possibilities referred are bare or naked possibilities and not coupled 
with an interest such as contingent remainders or future interest-also known as right 
of spes successionis which cannot be the subject to transfer. 
When a person is the owner of property, the property is in existence and it is in 
his possession. This he may transfer. But if property is neither in existence nor is the 
person the owner of the property then it cannot be transferred. For example, if a 
person is intending to buy certain property but, he has no interest in that property, he 
cannot transfer it unless the property comes to his hands, i.e., unless he becomes the 
owner of the property after buying it. But if a person obtains certain consideration and 
agrees to sell the property of which he is not the owner, then on becoming the actual 
owner of the property he has to transfer the property as there was a contract between 
him and the person who has agreed to buy the property. This transfer operates on a 
contract to be performed when the property comes into the hands of the person who 
has agreed to transfer. But where a person wants to make a gift of the property which 
is to come in his hands in future, he cannot transfer it because a gift is voluntary 
transfer without any consideration. Thus a gift of future property is void. Similarly, the 
chance of a heir apparent succeeding to the estate of a deceased person cannot be 
transferred. Suppose A is the owner of the property and B is his son. B is the heir of 
A. During the life time of his father A, B has only a hope expectancy that he will 
inherit the property of his father. This type of property which B hopes to get after the 
death of the father cannot be transferred, during the life time of A. 
Illustrations:  
(a) Suppose A, a Hindu who has separate property, dies leaving a widow W and 
a brother L, L‟s succession to the property is dependent upon two factors, viz., (i) his 
surviving the widow, W, and (ii) W leaving the property intact. L has only a bare 
chance of succession to the property left by A. This is spes successionis, and 
therefore, cannot be transferred (Amrit Narayana v. Gyan Singh, (1918) 45 Cal. 690). 
(b) A transfers to B for valuable consideration his reversionary interest in a 
property. When A succeeds to the property, B sues him for possession of the same. 
B will not succeed as the reversionary interest is a spes successionis and non-
transferable. So the transfer is void and B‟s suit for possession fails.

226 
(b)  Right of re-entry 
The right which the lessor has against the lessee for breach of an express 
condition which provides that on its breach the lessor may re-enter is called the right 
of re-entry. For instance, if A leases his property to B and adds a condition that if B 
sub-lets the leased land, A will have the right to re-enter, i.e., the lease will terminate 
if the lessee breaks the condition by subletting to a third person. Thus, right of re-
entry being a right for the personal benefit of any party cannot exist for the benefit of 
a person who has no personal interest in the land. For example, A grants his land by 
way of lease to B, a limited liability company on condition that the land should revert 
to A from B if the company goes into liquidation. This is a mere right in favour of A 
and this right A cannot transfer to anyone as this is a personal right which can be 
exercised by A only. But if A transfers the whole of his interest in the land including 
the right of re-entry to C, there the right to re-entry is a legal incident of property and 
can be validly transferred along with the property. 
(c)  Transfer of easement 
An easement is a right enjoyed by the owner of land over the land of another: 
such as, right of way, right of light, right of support, right to a flow of air or water. 
Section 4 of the Easements Act defines an easement as a right which the owner or 
occupier of certain land possesses as such for the beneficial enjoyment of the land, 
to do and continue to do something or to prevent and to continue to prevent 
something being done in or upon or in respect of certain other and not his own land. 
An easement includes a right to enjoy a profit out of the land of another. An easement 
exists for the accommodation and better enjoyment of the land to which it is annexed. 
The land owned by the possessor of the land is known as dominant tenement and the 
land over which the right is enjoyed is known as the servient tenement. As an 
easement confers no proprietory right on its owner, it cannot be transferred apart 
from the land itself. For example, the right of certain villagers to bath in another‟s tank 
cannot be transferred. Similarly if A, the owner of a house X, has a right of way over 
an adjoining plot of land belonging to B, he cannot transfer this right of way to C. But 
if he transfers the house itself to C, the easement is also transferred to C. 
It may be noted, however, that the prohibition is only with regard to transfer of an 
existing easement. The law does not prohibit the grant or creation of new easement 
(Bhagwan Sahai v. Narsing. (1909) 31 ALL. 612; Satyanarayana v. Lakshamaya 5 
H.L.J. 56 or the extension of an easement by release in favour of the owner of 
servient tenement). 
(d)  Restricted interest or personal interest 
An interest restricted in enjoyment to the owner personally is by its very nature 
not transferable unless the restriction is void under Section 10. Examples of such 
restricted interest or property are the following: 
 
(i) The right of pre-emption given under the Mohammedan Law. 
 (ii) The office of a Shebait of a Temple or mohunt of a mutt or mutuwalli of a 
wakf. 
 (iii) Emoluments attached to a priestly office. 
 (iv) Service tenures. 
 
EP-GCL-4 
227 
(e)  Right to future maintenance 
This again is a personal right in the property which the law says that it cannot be 
transferred. The right of a Hindu widow to maintenance is a personal right which 
cannot be transferred. Under the law the arrears of past maintenance can be 
transferred, but not the right to future maintenance. 
(f)  Mere right to sue and actionable claim 
A „mere right to sue‟ apart from the interest from which such right accrues cannot 
be assigned. The „right to sue‟ is a personal right annexed to the ownership of 
property and cannot be severed, from it. It is based on the principle of public policy to 
prevent multiplicity of suits; the object is mainly to prevent the abuse resulting from 
trafficking in litigation. 
The use of the word "mere" is significant. The question in every case is whether 
the subject-matter of transfer is property with an incidental remedy for its recovery or 
is a „mere‟ right to „sue‟. Where property is transferred along with a right to recover 
damages or compensation in respect of the property, the assignment is not hit by 
clause (4) of Section 6 of the T.P. Act. 
A mere right to sue cannot be transferred. The right refers to a right to damages 
arising both out of contracts as well as torts. For example, A commits an assault on 
B, B can file a suit to obtain damages; but B cannot assign the right to C and allow 
him to obtain damages. In contract also, the rule is the same. If A breaks a contract 
which he has entered into with B, B can bring action for damages, but B cannot 
transfer this right to C to recover damages. 
There is clear distinction between an actionable claim and a mere right to sue. An 
actionable claim is property and the assignee has a right to sue to enforce the claim. 
As already noted a right to recover an unascertained amount of damages 
resulting from breach of contract or tort is a mere right to sue. If, however, one has a 
right to recover an ascertained and definite debt, he may transfer it because it is an 
actionable claim. Thus, suppose A is indebted to B for Rs. 2,000 and B transfers the 
right to recover the debt of C, the transfer is void. A beneficial interest in specific 
moveable property is also an actionable claim. It has been held that the right to claim 
the benefit of an executory contract constitutes a beneficial interst in moveable 
property (Jaffer Meher Ali v. Budge Budge Jute Mills, (1900) 33 Cal. 702). 
After breach of a contract for the sale of goods nothing is left but a right to sue for 
damages which cannot be transferred. But before breach the benefit of an executing 
contract for the sale of goods may generally be transferred and the buyer has the 
right to sue for the goods. 
(g)  Transfer of public office and salaries, stipends, etc. 
It is against public policy for a public officer to transfer the salary of his office, for 
the salary is given for the purpose of upholding its dignity and the proper performance 
of its duties. Civil and military pensions are not transferable. A pension retains its 
character as long as it is unpaid and is in the hands of Government, but as soon as it 
is paid to the pensioner or his legal representatives, it can be transferred. Since these 
allowances, pensions and stipends are given on personal basis, the law does not 
allow these types of property to be transferred. 
EP-GCL-4 
228 
17.  RULE AGAINST PERPETUITY 
Section 14 of the Act provides that no transfer of property can operate to create 
an interest which is to take effect after the life time of one or more persons living at 
the date of such transfer, and the minority of some person who shall be in existence 
at the expiration for that period, and to whom, if he attains full age, the interest 
created is to belong. 
The rule against perpetuity is based on the general principle that the liberty of 
alienation shall not be exercised to its own destruction and that all contrivances shall 
be void which tend to create a perpetuity or place property forever out of the reach of 
the exercise of the power of alienation. Perpetuity has been described as 
“exemptions from intermission or ceasing”. This has been said to be “odious in law, 
destructive to the commonwealth, and an impediment to commence, but preventing 
the wholesome circulation of property”. 
A perpetuity in the primary sense of the word, “is a disposition which makes 
property inalienable for an indefinite period” (Jarman on Wills, 8th ed., vol. 1, P. 284). 
Section 14 of the Act adopted with certain modifications the English rule against 
perpetuities which is enunciated by Jarman as “Subject to the exceptions to be 
presently mentioned, no Contingent or executory interest in property can be validity 
created, unless it must necessarily vest within the maximum period of one or more 
lives in being and twenty-one years afterwards”. Section 14 of the Act fixes the 
perpetuity period as: Life (or Lives) living at the time of transfer and actual minority of 
the then unborn ultimate transferee. 
Any number of successive estates can be created between the transferees who 
are living persons e.g. A transfer may be made to A for life and then to B for life and 
then to C for life and so on, provided that A, B and C are all living persons at the date 
of the transfer. But if the ultimate beneficiary is some one who is not in existence at 
the date of the transfer, the whole residue of the estate should be transferred to him. 
If he is born before the termination of the last prior estate, he takes a vested interest 
at birth and takes possession on the termination of the last prior estate but if he is not 
born till the termination of the last prior estate, the transfer to him fails. 
Further, the rule is not that vested interest is created at the birth of the beneficiary 
but that vested interest cannot be delayed in any case beyond his minority. 
Therefore, the rule against perpetuity is that the minority of the ultimate beneficiary is 
the latest period at which an estate can be made to vest. 
In India minority terminates at the end of 18 years. 
The rule against perpetuities applies to both moveable and immoveable property. 
Thus, the rule against perpetuity contains two propositions, i.e.: 
 (1) No transfer is valid after the life-time of one or more persons living at the 
date of such transfer. Transfer can remain in effect only during the life time 
of an existing person. 
 (2) Transfer can be extended to a person who is not in existence but if he is in 
existence at the time of termination of the period of last transfer. The 
moment the person is born he shall have contingent interest and after 
minority i.e. after the age of 18 years, he shall have vested interest. Barring 
these two conditions, a restriction on alienation of a property is void. 
 
EP-GCL-4 
229 
 
 The rule against perpetuities is also called the rule against remoteness 
because it is directed against limitations which are too remote and are 
expressed to take effect beyond the maximum period permitted by law. 
However, Section 18 provides an exception to the above rule of perpetuity, where 
the transfer of property is for the benefit of the public in the advancement of religion, 
knowledge, commerce, health, safety, or any other object beneficial to mankind. 
Effect of a transfer on failure of prior interest 
Further, where by reason of any rules or the rules contained in Sections 13 and 
14, interest created for the benefit of a person or class of persons fails in regard to 
such person or the whole of such class, any interest created in the same transaction 
and intended to take effect or upon failure of such prior intersts also fail (Section 16). 
For example, property is transferred to A for life then to his unborn son B for life and 
then to C, who is living at the date of transfer, absolutely. Here B is given only a life 
interest. So the transfer to B is invalid under Section 13. The subsequent transfer to 
C absolutely is also invalid, because according to Section 16, if a prior transfer fails, 
the subsequent transfer will also fail. 
No transfer of property can operate to create an interest which is to take effect 
after the life time of one or more persons living at date on such transfer, and the 
minority of some person who shall be in existence on the expiration of that period, to 
whom, if he attains full age, the interest created is to belong. 
The policy of the law has been to prevent property being tied up for ever. The 
vesting cannot be postponed beyond the life time of any person living at the date of 
transfer. For example, if an estate is given to a living person A for life and then to the 
unborn son of A, the son of A must be in existence on or before the date of the expiry 
of the life estate in favour of A. The vesting of absolute interest in favour of an unborn 
person may be postponed until he attains majority. For example, an estate may be 
transferred to A, living person, and after his death to his unborn son when he attains 
the age of 18. Such transfer would not be violative of the rule against perpetuity. 
18.  ACCUMULATION OF INCOME 
Section 17 does not allow accumulation of income from the land for an unlimited 
period without the income-being enjoyed by owner of the property. The law allows 
accumulation of income for a certain period only. The period for which such 
accumulation is valid is : 
 (a) the life of the transferor, or 
 (b) eighteen years from the date of transfer. 
Any direction to accumulate the income beyond the period mentioned above is 
void except where it is for: 
 
(i) the payment of the debts of the transferor or any other person taking any 
interest under the transferor, 
 (ii) portions for children or any other person taking any interest in the property 
under the transfer, and 
 (iii) for the preservation and maintenance of the property transferred.

19.  DOCTRINE OF LIS PENDENS 
Lis means dispute, Lis pendens means a pending suit, action, petition or the like. 
Section 52 of the T.P. Act incorporates the doctrine of Lis pendens. It states that 
during the pendency of a suit in a Court of Law, property which is subject to a 
litigation cannot be transferred. When we say that property cannot be transferred 
what we mean in this context is that property may be transferred but this transfer is 
subject to the rights that are created by a Court‟s decree. For example, A and B are 
litigating in a Court of law over property X and during the pendency of the suit A 
transfers the property X to C. The suit ends in B‟s favour. Here C who obtained the 
property during the time of litigation cannot claim the property. He is bound by the 
decree of the Court wherein B has been given the property. 
Section 52 lays down the Indian rule of Lis pendens being the legislative 
expression of the Maxim- “ut lite pendente nihil innovetur” „During litigation nothing 
new should be introduced‟. 
Essentials 
In order to constitute a Lis pendens, the following elements must be present: 
 
1. There must be a suit or proceeding in a Court of competent jurisdiction. 
 
2. The suit or proceeding must not be collusive. 
 
3. The litigation must be one in which right to immoveable property is directly 
and specifically in question. 
 
4. There must be transfer of or otherwise dealing with the property in dispute 
by any party to the litigation. 
 
5. Such transfer must effect the rights of the other party that may ultimately 
accrue under the terms of the decree or order. 
The rule is based on the doctrine of expediency i.e., the necessity for final 
adjudication. A plea of lis pendens will be allowed to be raised even though the point 
is not taken in the pleadings or raised as an issue. 
When an application to sue in forma pauperies is admitted, the suit is pending 
from the time of presentation of the application to the Court but not if it is rejected. 
A suit in foreign Court cannot operate as lis pendens. The doctrine of lis pendens 
does not apply to moveables. It is the essence of the rule that a right to immoveable 
property is directly and specifically in question in the suit. The doctrine is not 
applicable in favour of a third-party. 
 
EP-GCL-4 
231 
Effect 
If the parties to the litigation, are completely prevented from transferring the 
property in litigation, it would cause unnecessary delay and hardship, as they would 
have to wait till the final disposal of the case. So, Section 53 creates a limitation over 
the transfer by making it subject to the result of the litigation. The effect of this 
doctrine is not to invalidate or avoid the transfer, or to prevent the vesting of title in 
the transfer, but to make it subject to the decision of the case, and the rule would 
operate even if the transferee pendente lite had no notice of the pending suit or 
proceeding at the time of the transfer. 
20.  PROVISIONS RELATING TO SPECIFIC TRANSFERS 
The Act expressly provides for special types of transfers such as sale, exchange, 
gift, mortgage and lease. 
These are as follows: 
In a sale, exchange and gift, there is a transfer of the ownership of property but 
mortgage is a transfer of an interest in specific immoveable property and lease is a 
transfer of the right to enjoy immoveable property. 
1.  Sale 
Under Section 54 of the T.P. Act, "sale" has been defined as a 
transfer of ownership in exchange for a price paid or promised or part 
paid and part-promised. 
Essentials 
 (a) The seller must be a person competent to transfer. The buyer must be any 
person who is not disqualified to be the transferee under Section 6(h)(3). 
 (b) The subject matter is transferable property. 
 (c) There is a transfer of ownership. This feature distinguishes a sale from 
mortgage, lease etc., where there is no such transfer of ownership. 
 (d) It must be an exchange for a price paid or promised or part paid and part 
promised. 
 (e) There must be present a money consideration. If the consideration is not 
money but some other valuable consideration it may be an exchange or 
barter but not a sale. 
Mode of transfer by sale 
Sale of an immoveable property can be effected, 
 (a) Where such property is tangible (i) by a registered instrument if it is of the 
value of Rs. 100 and upwards, and (ii) by a registered instrument or by 
delivery of property when it is less than Rs. 100 in value, and 
 (b) Where the property is tangible or a reversion, only by a registered 
instrument. 
EP-GCL-4 
232 
Contract for sale 
A contract for the sale of immoveable property differs from a contract for the sale 
of goods in that the Court will grant specific performance of it unless special reasons 
to the contrary are shown. 
The rights and liabilities of a seller and buyer are dealt with in Section 55 of the 
Transfer of Property Act. 
2.  Exchange 
Sections 118 to 121 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deal with "Exchanges". 
When two persons mutually transfer the ownership of one thing for the 
ownership of another, neither thing or both things being money only, 
the transaction is called an "exchange". 
Essentials 
 
(i) The person making the exchange must be competent to contract. 
 (ii) There must be mutual consent. 
 (iii) There is a mutual transfer of ownership though things and interests may not 
be identical. 
 (iv) Neither party must have paid money only. 
This Section applies to both moveable and immoveable property. 
Mode of exchange 
A transfer of property in completion of an exchange can be made only in the 
matter provided for the transfer of such property by sale. 
3.  Gift 
The provisions relating to "Gifts" have been stipulated under Sections 122 to 128 
of the Act. 
Section 122 of the Transfer of Property Act defines "gift" as follows: 
 
 “Gift" is the transfer of certain existing moveable or immoveable property 
made voluntarily and without consideration by one person called the donor, 
to another called the donee and accepted by or on behalf of the donee. 
 
 Such acceptance must be made during the life time of the donor and while 
he is still capable of giving. If the donee dies before acceptance, the gift is 
void. 
Essentials 
 
1. There must be a transfer of ownership. 
 
2. The subject matter of gift must be a certain existing 
moveable or immoveable property. 
 
EP-GCL-4 
233 
 
3. The transfer must be made voluntarily. 
 
4. It must be done without consideration. 
 
5. There must be acceptance by or on behalf of the donee, and such 
acceptance must be made during the lifetime of the donor and while he is 
capable of giving. 
There are two parties to the gift: donor and donee. The donor must be a person 
competent to transfer; whereas the donee may be any person. The gift can be made 
to any one, to an incompetent person or even to a juridicial person. The essence of a 
gift is that it is a gratuitous transfer. 
Formalities 
According to Section 123, a gift of immoveable property must be made by a 
registered instrument signed by or on behalf of the donor and attested by at least two 
witnesses. A gift of moveable property may be made by a registred instrument or by 
delivery of property. Where the donee is already in possession of the moveable 
property, as no future delivery is possible, the donor may make a declaration of the 
gift in his favour. For example, where a piece of furniture or a television set belonging 
to the donor is lying with a friend of his, the donor may simply declare that he makes 
a gift of the furniture or the television set and the gift is complete. The declaration 
must be clear and the donee must accept the gift. 
A gift of immoveable property, as said above, must be effected by registration. 
Where a gift in favour of someone is registered but it is not accepted by the donee, 
the gift is incomplete. Suppose, a document is executed by the donor who makes a 
gift of immoveable property and the deeds are delivered to donee, and the donee 
accepts the gifts but the document is not registered. Will the gift by valid? It has been 
held by the Courts that the gift is valid. While registration is a necessary formality for 
the enforcement of a gift of immoveable property, it does not suspend the gift until 
registration actually takes place. The donee in such a case can ask the donor to 
complete the gift by registration. Thus, the most essential thing for the validity of a gift 
is its acceptance. If the gift is accepted but not registred it is a valid gift. The Privy 
Council in Kalyan Sundram v. Kumarappa, A.I.R. 1925 P.C. 42, decided that 
after acceptance of the deed of gift and before registration, the donor cannot 
revoke the gift. The gift which is accepted by the donee, will take effect from 
the date of the execution of the document by the donor, even though it is 
registered at a later date. 
If the deed of gift is executed but never communicated to the intended donee and 
remains in the possession of the donor undelivered, it cannot be compulsory 
registered at the instance of the donee. The reason is that the donee did not accept 
the gift, the donor can at any time before such acceptance revoke the gift. But once a 
gift is accepted by the donee, the donor cannot revoke it. A gift may, however, be 
revoked if it is brought about by a fraud or misrepresentation or undue influence. 
The other essential characteristic of a gift is that it cannot be revoked at the will 
and pleasure of the grantor. A revocable gift is one which may be revoked by the 
donor at any time. Its revocation would depend upon the mere will or pleasure of the 
donor. Such a gift is void. But on the other hand, if the condition is one which does 
not depend on the will or pleasure of the donor, the gift can be revoked on the 
happening of such condition.

Illustrations 
 (a) A gives a field to B, reserving to himself, with B‟s assent, the rights to take 
back the field in case B and his descendents die before A, B dies without 
descendents during A‟s lifetime. A may take back the field. 
 (b) A gives a lakh of rupees to B, reserving to himself with B‟s assent the right 
to take back at leisure Rs. 10,000 out of one lakh. The gift holds goods as 
to Rs. 90,000 but is void as to Rs. 10,000 which continues to belong to A. 
A gift which comes into existence on the fulfilment of a condition, that is to say, a 
gift which is subject to a condition precedent is also valid. A condition precedent, as 
already explained in this study dealing with vested interest and contingent interest, is 
one which must be fulfilled before the transfer takes effect. But the condition attached 
to the gift should not be illegal or immoral. For instance, a gift to A on condition that 
he murders B is not valid. 
A gift comprising both of existing property and future property is void as to the 
latter. For example, A makes a gift of his house and also makes a gift of the additions 
that he is likely to make in future. Here the gift of the house is valid but the gift of the 
additions that are yet to be made is invalid. 
Onerous gift:  Lastly reference may also be made to what is known as an 
onerous gift. It may be that several things are transferred as a gift by single 
transaction. Whereas some of them are really beneficial the others convey 
burdensome obligations. The result is that the benefit which it confers is more than 
counter balanced by the burden it places. For instance, A makes a gift of shares in 
the companies X and Y. X is prosperous but heavy calls are expected in respect of 
shares in Y company. The gift is onerous.The rule as laid down in Section 127 is that 
the donee takes nothing by the gift unless he accepts it fully. Where the gift is in the 
form of two or more independent transfers to the same person of several things, the 
donee is at liberty to accept one of them and refuse the other. 
The rules pertaining to gifts in the Transfer of Property Act do not apply to the 
gifts by Mohammedans. If a gift is made by a Mohammedan, its validity has to be 
judged according to Muslim law and not according to the Transfer of Property Act.

4.  Leases 
(i)  Meaning and nature of lease:  According to Section 105, a "lease" of 
immoveable property is a transfer of a right to enjoy property. Since it is a transfer to 
enjoy and use the property, possession is always given to the transferee. The lease 
of immoveable property must be made for a certain period. For example, you may 
give a lease of property for a definite number of years, or for life, or even 
permanently. 
Essentials 
The essentials of a lease are: 
 
(1) It is a transfer of a right to enjoy immoveable property; 
 (2) Such transfer is for a certain time or perpetuity; 
 (3) It is made for consideration which is either premium or rent or both; 
 (4) The transfer must be accepted by the transferee. 
The transferor is called the lessor, the transferee is called the lessee, the price is 
called premium and the money, share, service or any other thing of value to be so 
rendered is called the rent. 
The parties to the lease (i.e. lessor and lessee), must be competent to make and 
to take the lease respectively. 
(ii)  Lease and licence:  A lease should be distinguished from a licence. A licence 
is a right to do or continue to do in or upon the immoveable property of the grantor, 
something which would, in the absence of such a right, be unlawful. 
A licence does not transfer any interest in the property and the licencee has no 
right to possession. A licence can be revoked by the grantor at any time, whereas a 
lease cannot be revoked. If, I sell the fruits of my garden to you, you are given 
permission or licence to enter my garden and take away the fruits. A lease involves a 
transfer of interest followed by possession of the property for a specified period. The 
real test is the intention of the parties.  
If the document creates an interest in the property, it is a lease but if it only 
permits another to make use of the property of which the legal possession 
continues with the owner, it is a licence because it does not create any interest 
in that property (Associated Hotel of India v. R.N. Kapoor, A.I.R. (1956) S.C. 
1962).  
The question is not of words but of substance and the label which the parties 
choose to put upon the transaction though relevant is not decisive. 
(iii)  Formalities:  According to Section 107, a lease from year to year or for any 
term exceeding one year can be made only by a registered document. If a lease is  
for a term below one year, it can be made by an oral agreement. If a lease is created 
by oral agreement, it must be accompanied by delivery of possession. If the lease is 
for a year or more, it must be effected by a registered document. If after the 
registration, the lessor does not give possession, the lessee can sue for possession. 
EP-GCL-4 
236 
(iv)  Types of tenancies:  Following are the various types of tenancies: 
 (a) Tenancy from year to year:  A tenancy from year to year may be made by a 
grant of land from year to year. If the tenancy is for a year to start with but 
after the expiration of one year the lessee continues to be in possession 
and pays the rent to the landlord, the tenancy is regarded as a year-to-year 
tenancy. If, in case of a tenancy for a period more than a year the landlord 
wants to terminate or end the lease, he has to give a six-month‟s notice to 
the lessee to quit. In case of a tenancy from month to month, a fifteen days 
notice to quit is necessary. The monthly tenancy may be created either by 
contract or may be presumed from the nature of the tenancy to be one, 
from month to month. 
Illustration 
A lets a house to B for 5 years, B sublets the house to C at a monthly rent of Rs. 
100. The five years expire, but C continues in possession of the house and pays the 
rent to A. C‟s lease is renewed from month to month. 
 (b) Tenancy-at-will:  Tenancy-at-will is a tenancy recognised by law. This comes 
into existence where a tenant holds over with the consent is let into 
occupation. We have stated above that if the tenant continues to be in 
possession after the expiration of tenancy and pays the rent to the landlord, 
the tenancy may be one from year to year or from month to month. During a 
period when the tenant is in possession after expiry of the period, if the 
tenant stays with the consent of the landlord till such time as further period is 
fixed or a fresh contract is made, the tenant is called a tenant-at-will. The 
landlord will decide for what further period shall the tenancy be given. „A 
tenancy-at-will is implied when a person is in possession by the consent of 
the owner and is not held in view of any tenancy for a certain time. The 
tenancy-at-will does not mean that the landlord has to give a proper notice to 
quit. The tenant-at-will cannot sublet during that period because no valid 
contract for further extension in his favour has been made. The death of the 
landlord or tenant determines the tenancy, i.e., the tenancy comes to an end. 
 (c) A tenancy by sufferance:  This is a tenancy which is created by fiction of 
law. If a tenant continues to be in possession after the determination of the 
period of the lease without the consent of the landlord, he becomes a 
tenant by sufferance. A tenant-at-will is in possession with the consent of 
the landlord, whereas a tenant by sufferance is in possession without his 
permission after the term of the lease comes to an end. This type of tenant 
is not regarded as a trespasser because the tenant had in his favour a valid 
lease to start with. No notice is necessary to such a tenant for eviction. This 
tenant is not responsible for rent. He is liable to pay compensation for use 
and occupation of the land. 
(v)  Requirements of a valid notice:  In order that a notice to quit is valid it must 
be a proper notice. The notice must convey the intention to terminate the tenancy as 
a whole and must specify the date on which the tenancy would expire. As mentioned 
earlier, if the lease is a lease from month to month, 15 days, notice is required. If it is 
from year to year 6 months‟ notice is required. A lease of the moveable property for 
agricultural or manufacturing purposes shall be deemed to be a lease from year to 
year. The notice should expire with the end of the period of the tenancy. If it is a lease 
 
EP-GCL-4 
237 
from month to month and the notice is given by the landlord, the tenant should be 
asked to quit at the end of the month of the tenancy. The landlord cannot ask his 
tenant to quit at any time before the expiry of a month or a year of the tenancy. 
Illustration 
A grants lease for 4 years commencing form 1-6-1961. (This day should be 
excluded for counting the duration of lease). The lease will end at the midnight of        
1-6-1965, i.e., the lease commenced from 2-6-1961, therefore, a notice to quit given 
on 1-2-1968 for leaving the premises on 1-3-1968 is a notice expiring with the end of 
month of tenancy and it is a valid notice. 
Note that in the above illustration, the lease after 4 years is continued on a 
monthly tenancy basis till the landlord gives notice in the year 1968. 
(vi)  Determination of leases:  Section 111 of the Transfer of Property Act spells 
out the various contingencies in which a lease comes to an end. A lease is 
determined, i.e., comes to an end in the following ways: 
 (1) By efflux of time or lapse of time:  A lease for a definite period, such as a 
lease for a year, or for a term of years, expires on the last day of the term 
and the lessor or any person entitled to get back the property may enter 
without notice or any other formality. Since a lease is a transfer of interest 
in the property, if during the period for which a lease is valid, the lessee 
dies, the heirs of the lessee can continue the lease till the expiry of the 
period. 
 (2) By the happening of a special event:  When a lease is granted subject to 
the happening of an event, it comes to an end when the event takes place. 
Thus, if B grants lease to A for life, it comes to an end on the death of A. 
Similarly, if a lease is granted for the duration of the war, it comes to an end 
when the war ends. Where the interest of the lessor is limited, the lease 
comes, to an end when he loses the interest or where he does not have 
any power to grant a lease. For example, a tenant for life can grant a lease 
only to last during his life time. It comes to an end on his death. 
 (3) Merger:  A lease comes to an end when the lessee buys the property of the 
lessor or when the lessee takes the lessor‟s interest by succession. Here 
the right of the lessee merges in that of the lessor. Naturally, the lessee 
becomes the owner of the property after he acquires it. So there will be no 
more a lease. 
 (4) By surrender:  A lease may come to an end by surrender. Surrender may 
be either express or implied. Express surrender arises when the lessee 
yields up his interst under a lease by mutual consent. Implied surrender 
occurs, as follows :- if during the subsistence of the lease, a new lease is 
granted to the tenant to commence at once in substitution for the existing 
lease, it operates as a surrender of the old lease. For example, a lessee, 
accepts to take effect during the continuance of the existing lease. This is 
an implied surrender of the former lease and such lease comes to an end. 
Similarly, when the landlord reserves possession without any objection on 
the tenant‟s part, there is a surrender by implication. Mere non-payment of 
rent does not amount to surrender. 
EP-GCL-4 
238 
? 
 (5) By forfeiture:  A lease also comes to an end by forfeiture. A forfeiture 
occurs when there is breach of a condition in a lease contract by the 
lessee. Under the Transfer of Property Act, forfeiture occurs in the following 
circumstances—the first case in which forfeiture occurs is the case when 
the lessee breaks an express condition which may be of various types such 
as, if the lessee does not pay the rent regularly, or if the lessee becomes 
insolvent, or where the lessee sublets the property to another person. In all 
such cases there will be a forfeiture. But the condition that the lessee 
breaks must be an express condition which must have been incorporated in 
the contract of lease. Then only the lessor can re-enter the leased property 
and claim that the lease shall be forfeited. 
In the case of a forfeiture due to default in payment of the rent, if the lessor sues 
the lessee to quit, the Court can direct the lessee to pay the rent or arrears of rent 
and continue the lease. But in a breach of any other condition, such as the breach of 
a condition preventing the lessee from subletting the property, the Court will not help 
the lessee if he breaks the condition. He will incur forfeiture. A breach of condition by 
the lessee gives an option to the lessor to bring the lease to an end. But if he does 
not exercise the option the lease will continue validly. The lessee, however, cannot 
on breaking the condition, take advantage of his wrong and terminate the lease. 
The second case of forfeiture occurs when the tenant denies the title of the 
landlord and claims that somebody else or he himself is the owner of the property. In 
order that a denial of the landlord‟s title should work as a forfeiture of the lease, three 
things are necessary: 
 (a) the tenant must set up title either in himself or in a third-party; 
 (b) the denial must be direct and not casual; 
 (c) it must be made known to the landlord. 
Illustration 
A is a tenant of B, but C claims to be the landlord. B sues A for rent and A in his 
written statement states. “I have never paid rent to B. C now claims rent. I am ready 
to pay whosoever is the rightful owner. There is no forfeiture and B cannot evict A in 
a subsequent suit. 
The third case where forfeiture occurs is where the lessee is adjudged an 
insolvent and the lease provides that the lessor may re-enter on the happening of 
such event. It may, however, be noted, that the effect of these provisions has been 
considerably diluted by various Rent Control and Eviction Acts passed by various 
legislatures.

Duties of the Lessor and Rights of the Lessee 
(vii)  Duties of the Lessor:  Following are some of the duties of the lessor: 
 (a) The lessor is bound to disclose to the lessee any material defect in the 
property with reference to its intended use of which the lessor is and the 
lessee is not aware. This rule applies only to physical defects of the 
property such as the condition and the nature of the property leased. You 
will note that the lessor is not bound to disclose whether or not he has title 
to the property. 
 (b) The next duty of the lessor is to put the lessee in possession of the 
property. A lease is a transfer of possession the consideration being rent 
and, therefore, it follows that the landlord cannot recover the rent unless he 
has delivered possession to the tenant. If a contract of lease has been 
executed and the lessor does not give possession of the property to the 
lessee, the lessee can sue the lessor for possession. 
 (c) The next duty that is cast on the lessor is what is usually called convenant 
for quiet enjoyment. The covenant, that is the right to undisturbed 
possession, so long as the lessee pays the rent, presupposes possession 
and, therefore, no action can be brought on this convenant unless the 
lessee has first obtained possession. The covenant for possession gives 
the lessee the right to obtain possession; the covenant for quiet enjoyment 
gives the lessee a right to continue in such possession. If the lessee‟s 
possession is disturbed, he can sue for damages or, in case a part of the 
leased property is taken possession of either by the lessor or by any third-
party; the lessee can hold a part of the leased property and pay a 
proportionate rent. 
(viii)  Duties of the lessee:  The lessee has the following duties: 
 (a) The lessee is bound to disclose to the lessor any fact as to nature or extent 
of the interest that the lessee is about to take, of which the lessee is, and 
the lessor is not aware and which materially increases the value of such 
interest. 
 (b) The lessee is bound to pay or tender at the proper time and place, the 
premium or rent to the lessor or his agent in this behalf. We have already 
seen that in case the lessee does not pay the rent, he may incur forfeiture 
of the tenancy. The liability to pay the rent commences from the date the 
tenant is put into possession. 
 (c) The next duty of the lessee is that he uses the property as a person of 
ordinary prudence would make use of. But he shall not permit another person 
to use the property for purposes other than that for which it was leased. 
 (d) He should not do any act which is destructive of or permanently injurious to 
the property. 
 (e)  The lessee must not, without the lessor‟s consent, erect on the property 
any permanent structure except for agricultural purpose. If he wants to 
erect certain fixtures or chattel on the leased property, it must be done 
without causing any damage to the property. Before the termination of the 
lease, he can remove all the things attached to the earth. If permanent 
fixtures are to be made, the lessee must obtain the consent of the landlord. 
EP-GCL-4 
240 
? 
 
(f) If the lessee comes to know of any proceedings by way of suit to recover 
the property of the lessor, the lessee should immediately inform the lessor. 
Since, the tenant is in possession of the property he is the person who is 
not likely to know of any encroachment on the landlord‟s property and he 
should therefore inform the landlord. 
 (g) The lessee should hand over the property at the end of the lease. 
(ix)  Rights of the lessee:  The lessee enjoys the following rights: 
 (a) If during the continuance of the lease any accession is made to the 
property, such accession is deemed to be comprised in the lease, the 
lessee has a right to enjoy the accretions of the leased property. 
 (b) Where, under the contract, the landlord has agreed to repair the property, 
the lessee can carry out the repairs and deduct the expenses from the rent 
if the landlord fails to do so. 
 (c) If the lessee has made payment which the lessor is bound by law to pay 
such as payment of Government revenues or municipal taxes on the 
property, the lessee can deduct the amount from the rent and pay the 
balance to the lessor. He can even take interest on the amount he has 
paid. 
 (d) The lessee has a right to remove the fixtures he has erected-during the 
term of the lease. 
 (e) If, due to no fault of his, the lease comes to an end (i.e., when the lease is 
of uncertain duration), the lessee or his legal representatives are entitled to 
all the crops planted or grown by the lessee. The lessee or his 
representatives have got a right to come and carry away the crops, etc., 
which are growing on the land. If the lease is of a definite period, such a 
right cannot be claimed, particularly, when lessee has committed a fault, 
e.g., where he has committed a breach of a condition entailing forfeiture. 
 
(f) The lessee may avoid the lease, if property is wholly or partly destroyed by 
tempest, flood, or fire so as to make it impossible to continue the lease for 
the purpose for which it was let. 
 (g) The lessee has right to transfer absolutely or by way of mortgage or sub-
lease, the whole or any part of his interest in the property. We have also 
noticed that the lessee‟s rights are transferable.

5.  Actionable Claims 
"Actionable claim" has been dealt with under Sections 130 to 137 of the Act. 
 
(i) Definition: "Actionable claim" is defined in Section 3 of the Transfer of 
Property Act as follows: 
 
 A claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immoveable 
property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any 
beneficial interest in moveable property not in the possession, either actual 
or constructive, of the claimant, which the Civil courts recognize as 
affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be 
existent, accruing, conditional or contingent. 
Actionable claims are claims, to unsecured debts. If a debt is secured by the 
mortgage of immoveable property it is not an actionable claim, because the Section 
clearly excludes such a debt. A debt is a liquidated money obligation which is usually 
recoverable by a suit. To create a debt, first of all, there must be a liquidated or 
definite sum which is actually due. For example, arrears of rent due. The term debt 
may also include a sum of money which is due in the sense that it exists, but is not 
actually payable until a later date. For example, A borrows money from B on the 1st 
of January and promises to rapay on March 15, the amount is not payable till the 15th 
of March, but certainly it is a debt and it is an accruing debt. Another essential of an 
actionable claim is that it is not in possession of a person and the person can claim 
such a debt by bringing an action in a Court of law. 
The Section also says that it must be a claim to any debt which the Civil Courts 
recognise as affording grounds for relief to the person who claims it. 
Illustrations of actionable claims: 
 
(i) Arrears of rent accrual constitute a „debt‟ so it is an actionable claim (Sheu 
Gobind Singh v. Gauri Prasad, AIR 1925 Pat. 310). 
 (ii) Provident Fund that is standing to the credit of a member of the Provident 
Fund. 
 (iii) Money due under the Insurance Policy. 
 (iv) A partner‟s right to sue for accounts of dissolved partnership is an 
actionable claim being a beneficial interest in moveable property not in 
possession (Thakardas v. Vishindas). 
Non-actionable claims 
 
(i) Debentures are secured debts and therefore not regarded as actionable 
claims. 
 (ii) Copy right though a beneficial interest in immoveable property is not 
an actionable claim since the owner has actual or constructive 
possession of the same (Savitri Devi v. Dwarka Bhatya, (1939) All 305). 
Again, an actionable claim includes a beneficial interest in the moveable property 
not in possession. Now, a benefit of a contract for the purchase of goods is a 
beneficial interest in moveable property. 
EP-GCL-4 
242 
Illustration 
A agrees on 1.2.1985 to deliver 1,000 gunny bags to B on 1.3.1985. On 1.2.1985 
B assigns interest in the contract to C. A fails to deliver the bags on 1.3.1985. C can 
sue A because a beneficial interest in a subsisting contract which relates to moveable 
property is an actionable claim which can be validly transferred. 
Suppose in the above Illustration B has assigned the right to C to claim damages 
after the contract was broken. That is B transfers his right to sue A on, say, 1.4.1985, 
(i.e., one month after the contract was broken). In this case what B has assigned to C 
is a mere right to sue A and get damages. B cannot transfer this right. You will recall 
that a mere right to sue cannot be transferred. After the breach of the contract, B has 
a mere right to sue A which he cannot assign or transfer. To repeat an actionable 
claim is a claim to any debt other than a debt secured by a mortgage and it includes a 
beneficial interest in the moveable property. 
(ii)  How actionable claims are transferred:  Actionable claims can be transferred 
by the execution of an instrument in writing signed by the transferor or his duly 
authorised agent. 
Not much formality is required for the transfer of an actionable claim. It can 
validly be transferred, in writing and signed by the transferor or his agent. After a valid 
transfer, the transferee of an actionable claim must give notice to the debtor to 
complete his title. Thereafter he can sue or institute proceedings for the same in his 
own name without obtaining the transferor‟s consent to such suit or proceedings. 
Illustration 
A owes money to B, who transfers it to C. B then demands the debt from A who 
not having received notice of transfer, pays to B. The payment is valid and C cannot 
sue A for the debt. 
Some problems and their Answers: 
 (a) A owed money to B. B transferred the debt by deed of gift to C. 
Subsequently, he transferred it for value to D. Who is entitled to the 
amount? 
 
 Answer:  The first transfer is in favour of C. The transfer of an actionable 
claim may be even without consideration. So the assignment in favour of C 
is valid. The subsequent transfer to D for consideration cannot deprive C of 
the rights which he has already acquired. C is, therefore, entitled to the 
money. 
 (b) A effects a policy on his own life with the Life Insurance Corporation and 
deposits it with a bank for securing payment of an existing debt. A dies and 
the bank claims the amount from the L.I.C., against A‟s heirs. Is the transfer 
to the Bank valid? 
 
 Answer:  The amount due under a policy of insurance is an actionable 
claim. The assignment of an actionable claim should be made in writing and 
by the transferor. The deposit of the policy by the transferor as security 
without written document in favour of the bank is not a valid assignement. 
The bank cannot have any claim as against the heirs of A.

6.  Mortgages  
Sections 58 to 104 of the Act deal with "Mortgages". 
(i)  Definition and nature of mortgage:  According to Section 58 of the Transfer of 
Property Act, a "mortgage" is the transfer of an interest in specific immoveable 
property for the purpose of securing the payment of money advanced or to be 
advanced by way of loan, an existing or future debt or the performance of an 
engagement which may give rise to pecuniary liability. 
The transferor is called a mortgagor, the transferee a mortgagee. The principal 
money and interest the payment of which is secured for the time being are called the 
mortgage money and the instrument by which the transfer is effected is called a 
mortgage deed. 
(ii)  Essentials of a mortgage: 
 
(1) Transfer of interest:  The first thing to note is that a 
mortgage is a transfer of interest in the specific immoveable 
property. The mortgagor as an owner of the property is possessed of all the 
interests in it, and when he mortgages the property to secure a loan, he 
only parts with an interest in that property in favour of the mortgagor. After 
mortgage, the interest of the mortgagor is reduced by the interest which 
has been transferred to the mortgagee. His ownership has become less for 
the time being by the interest which he has parted with in favour of the 
mortgagee. If the mortgagor transfers this property, the transferee gets it 
subject to the right of the mortgagor to recover from it what is due to him, 
i.e., the principal plus interest. 
 (2) Specific immoveable property:  The second point is that the property must 
be specifically mentioned in the mortgage deed. Where, for instance, the 
mortgagor stated “all of my property” in the mortgage deed, it was held by 
the Court that this was not a mortgage. The reason why the immoveable 
property must be distinctly and specifically mentioned in the mortgage deed 
is that, in case the mortgagor fails to repay the loan the Court is in a 
position to grant a decree for the sale of any particular property in a suit by 
the mortgagee. 
 (3) To secure the payment of a loan:  Another characteristic of a mortgage is 
that the transaction is for the purpose of securing the payment of a loan for 
the performance of an obligation which may give rise to pecuniary liability. It 
may be for the purpose of obtaining a loan, or if a loan has already been 
granted to secure the repayment of such loan. There is thus a debt and the 
relationship between the mortgagor and the mortgagee is that of debtor and 
creditor. When A borrows 100 bags of paddy and further quantity by way of 
interest, it is mortgage transaction for the performance of an obligation. 
Where, however, a person borrows money and agrees with the creditor that till 
the debt is repaid he will not alienate his property, the transaction does not amount to 
a mortgage. Here the person merely says that he will not transfer his property till he 
has repaid the debt; he does not transfer any interest in the property to the creditor. 
In sale as distinguished from a mortgage, all the interest or rights of ownership are 
transferred to the purchaser. In a mortgage, as stated earlier, only part of the 
EP-GCL-4 
244 
interests are transferred to the mortgagee, some of them remaining vested in the 
mortgagor. 
To sum up, it may be stated that there are three outstanding 
characteristics of a mortgage: 
 
(a) the mortgagee‟s interest in the property mortgaged 
terminates upon the performance of the obligation secured by the 
Mortgage. 
 (b) the mortgagor has a right of foreclosure upon the mortgagor‟s failure to 
perform. 
 (c) the mortgagor has a right to redeem or regain the property on repayment of 
the debt or performance of the obligation. 
(iii)  Form of a mortgage contract:  According to Section 59, where the principal 
money secured is Rs. 100 or upwards, a mortgage, other than a mortgage by deposit 
of title-deeds, can be effected only by a registered instrument or by delivery of 
property. It should be noted that a mortgage is not a mere contract but it is the 
Conveyance of Interest in the mortgaged property and as soon as the mortgage deed 
is registered an interest in the property vests in the mortgagee. 
(iv)  Kinds of mortgages:  There are in all six kinds of mortgages in immoveable 
property, namely 
 (a) Simple mortgage. 
 (b) Mortgage by conditional sale. 
 (c) Usufractuary mortgage. 
 (d) English mortgage. 
 (e) Mortgage by deposit of title-deeds or equitable mortgage. 
 
(f) Anomalous mortgage. 
(a)  Simple mortgage 
In a simple mortgage, the mortgagor binds himself personally to pay the debt and 
agrees in the event of his failure to pay the mortgage money, the mortgagee shall 
have the right to cause the property to be applied so far as may be necessary by 
means of a decree for the sale of property. If the mortgaged property is not sufficient 
to discharge the debt, the mortgagee can bring a personal action against the 
mortgagor and obtain a decree which, like any other money decree, can be executed 
against other properties of the mortgagor. In simple mortgage, no right of possession 
or foreclosure is available to the mortgagee. 
(b)  Mortgage by conditional sale 
In this type of mortgage, the property is mortgaged with a condition super added 
that in the event of a failure by the debtor to repay the debt at the stipulated time, the 
transaction should be regarded a sale, and in case the loan is repaid at the stipulated 
time, the sale shall be invalid, or on condition that on such payment being made the 
buyer shall transfer the property to the seller. 
Thus, for all practical purposes, this type of mortgage is ostensible sale of the 
mortgaged property with a condition for re-purchase by the mortgagor by repaying 
 
EP-GCL-4 
245 
the loan. It will be noted that the mortgagor transfers the property with the following 
three conditions: 
 (a) If the loan is repaid, the sale becomes void. 
 (b) If the loan is not repaid at the stipulated time, the sale will become absolute 
and binding. 
 (c) When the debt has been repaid at the stipulated time, the mortgagee shall 
re-transfer the property to the mortgagor. 
 
 In case of mortgage by conditional sale, there is no personal covenant. 
That is unlike in the case of a simple mortgage, the mortgagor in this case 
does not bind himself personally to repay the debt. The mortgagee is not 
given the possession of the property in this type of mortgage. This is also 
the position in the case of a simple mortgage. Again, in a mortgage by 
conditional sale, the mortgagee‟s remedy is „foreclosure‟, that is he 
becomes the owner of the property in default of payment of the debt by the 
mortgagor, he has to institute a regular suit in a Court of law to "foreclose" 
the mortgage. To "foreclose" means to debar the mortgagor from 
redeeming the property forever. 
(c)  Usufractuary mortgage 
Section 58(d) defines a "usufructuary mortgage" as “where the mortgagor 
delivers possession or expressly or by implication binds himself to deliver possession 
of the mortgaged property to the mortgagee, and authorises him to retain such 
possession until payment of the mortgage money, and to receive the rents and profits 
accruing from the property or any part of such rents and profits and to appropriate the 
same in lieu of interest, or in payment of the mortgage money, or partly in lieu of 
interest or partly in payment of the mortgage money, the transaction is called an 
usufractuary mortgage. It is also called a mortgage with possession. 
Thus is this type of mortgage the mortgagor has to deliver possession of the 
property to the mortgagee. If the possession is not given, the mortgagee can sue for 
possession. The mere fact that possession has not been delivered will not alter the 
nature of the transaction. In Pratap Bahadur v. Gajadhar, 24 All 521, it was agreed 
that the mortgagee will put the mortgagor in possession of a village on a 
certain date and to pay interest till possession was delivered. It was held that 
mortgage was an usufructuary mortgage. The mortgagee is authorised to retain 
possession and receive rents, etc., until he recovers the whole debt and the interest. 
The usufractuary mortgagee has to look only to the profits that arise out of the 
property for realising his debt; there is no personal liability on the part of the 
mortgagor. Similarly, the mortgagee has no right to foreclose the mortgage or to sue 
for sale. 
A mortgage may be regarded as usufructuary even though the entire debt is not 
to be paid out of the profits of the property. Therefore, a usufractuary mortgage may 
be either (i) where the entire mortgage money is to be paid from the profit of the land; 
or (ii) where only part of the mortgage money is principal or interest amount is to be 
paid from the profit of the land. 
If in a usufractuary mortgage a time is mentioned during which the mortgagee 
should recover the debt, etc., then after the time is over, the mortgagee should 
EP-GCL-4 
246 
deliver back the property to the mortgagor. He cannot refuse to give back the 
property, if he has not been able to recover the debt and the interest, etc. A 
usufractuary mortgagee is supposed to remain in possession of the mortgaged 
property and manage the same as a person of ordinary prudence would manage 
subject to the conditions of mortgage agreement. Any loss due to failure on his part 
would be debited to his account (Panchanan Sharma v. B.P. Jagnani, SCALE 1995 
(2) 641). 
Thus, a usufractuary mortgage has the following characteristics: 
 
1. Possession of property must be delivered to the mortgagee; 
 
2. There is no personal liability on the part of the mortgagor to pay; 
 
3. The mortgagee is entitled to rents and profits in lieu of interest or principal 
or both; and 
 
4. The mortgagee however is not entitled to foreclose the mortgagee or to sue 
for sale. 
(d)  English mortgage 
Section 58(e) states that: “where the mortgagor binds himself to repay the 
mortgage money on a certain date, and transfers the mortgaged property absolutely 
to the mortgagee but subject to a proviso that he will retransfer it to the mortgagor 
upon payment of the money as agreed, the transaction is called an English 
mortgage”. 
Here the mortgagor transfers the ownership of the property as security and the 
mortgagee promises to re-transfer the ownership, if the money is paid within a 
definite time. There is also a personal covenant as the mortgagor promises to repay 
within a certain date. In this type of mortgage, there is proviso that if money is repaid 
the property would be reconveyed. The remedy of the mortgagee is sale of the 
property to recover the debt. Thus, the essential features of an English mortgage are 
as under: 
 
1. The mortgagor binds himself to repay the mortgage money on a certain 
day. In other words, there should be a personal undertaking to pay. 
 
2. The mortgaged property is absolutely transferred to the mortgagee. 
 
3. Such absolute transfer is subject to a proviso that the mortgagee will 
reconvey the property to the mortgagor upon payment by him of the 
mortgage money on the fixed day. 
Distinction between English mortgage and mortgage by conditional sale 
An English mortgage looks like a mortgage by conditional sale but there are 
obvious differences between the two: 
 
1. In English mortgage there is a personal liability undertaken by the 
mortgagor to pay the debt. In a mortgage by conditional sale there is no 
personal covenant (agreement for payment of the mortgage money and 
mortgagee has his remedy against the mortgaged property only; 
 
2. In English mortgage the ownership in the mortgaged property is absolutely 
transferred to the creditor (i.e. mortgagee) which however, may be divested 
on repayment of the loan on the fixed day.

In a mortgage by conditional sale, the mortgagee gets only a qualified ownership 
which may, however, ripen into an absolute ownership in default of payment of the 
mortgage money.

Choose the correct answer 
In which of the following mortgages, the ownership in the mortgaged property is 
absolutely transferred to the creditor? 
 (a) Simple mortgage 
 (b) English mortgage 
 (c) Anomalous mortgage 
 (d) Usufructuary mortgage 
Correct Answer: (b) 
 
(e)  Mortgage by deposit of title deeds 
This type of mortgage is called equitable mortgage in English law. In this 
transaction, a person delivers to the creditor or his agent documents of title of his 
immoveable property with an intention to create a security, and obtains a loan. The 
requisites of such a mortgage are (i) a debt, (ii) deposit of title deeds, and (iii) an 
intention that the deeds shall be security for the debt. 
In order that a valid mortgage on an immoveable property should be effected, it 
must be in writing and attested by two witnesses and the document must be 
registered. But in case of a mortgage by deposit of title deeds, it need not be 
registered and an oral agreement between the person and the creditor followed by 
the delivery of the documents of title to the property is enough. The creditor will have 
the possession of the documents and he will advance the money at the stipulated 
rate of interest. In case the mortgagor does not repay the loan, the creditor on the 
basis of having the title deeds in his possession can sue the debtor to recover the 
money. This type of mortgage has been recognized due to expediency. Many 
persons, specially the business people, may need money urgently and they cannot 
wait till a formal document is written, signed, attested and then registered. So they 
will simply approach the creditor and hand over the title deeds of their property and 
borrow money. This avoids delay and other formalities for effecting a valid mortgage. 
There must be a clear intention on the part of the person who hands over the title 
deeds to effect a valid mortgage. In the absence of any intention, the mere holding in 
possession of the title deeds will not create a valid mortgage. 
The term „documents of title‟ or title deeds means such documents as will show 
prima facie or apparent title to the property of the person who is borrowing money. 
Accordingly, in one case it was held that tax receipt was not a document of title to the 
property on which the tax was paid. What is necessary to deposit is a document 
which gives him his right to the property and the creditor should insist on the 
production of this document before he gives money on a pledge of documents. 
EP-GCL-4 
248 
It should be noted that this type of mortgage can be created only in certain towns 
and not everywhere in India. The facility to create a valid mortgage is available in the 
following towns in India: Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, Adoni, Ajmer, Allahabad, Alwar, 
Bangalore, 
Bellary, 
Cochin, 
Coimbatore, 
Delhi, 
Jaipur, 
Jodhpur, 
Kanpur, 
Rajahmundry, 
Udaipur, 
Vellor, 
Ellora, 
Pali, 
Bhilwara, 
Bikaner, 
Kakinada, 
Narayanganj, Mysore, and Madurai. Though this type of mortgage is limited to 
specific cities it is at par with any other legal mortgage (K.J. Nathan v. S.V. Maruthi 
Rao, A.I.R. 1965 S.C. 443). 
Title deeds should be delivered in these areas, the property of the person may be 
situated elsewhere. If the deposit of title deeds has taken place in any other town, it 
will not be a valid mortgage. Similarly, if the property is situated in any one of the 
towns mentioned above, but the deposit of title deeds is made in other towns or areas 
then again it will not be a valid mortgage. 
(f)  Anomalous mortgage 
Section 58(g) of the Transfer of Property Act provides that “a mortgage which is 
not a simple mortgage, a mortgage by conditional sale, usufrauctuary mortgage, an 
English mortgage, or a mortgage by deposit of title deeds within the meaning of this 
section is called an anomalous mortgage”. 
Thus, an anomalous mortgage is a combination of various other mortgages, for 
example, a usufractuary mortgage may be created and the mortgagee shall have the 
right of sale. You have already noticed that in a usufractuary mortgage only 
possession is given to the mortgagee and there is no right of sale. But in an 
anomalous mortgage the right of sale along with the possession of the property may 
be given. You have also seen that in the case of usufractuary mortgage, there is no 
personal liability on the part of a mortgagor but if the mortgagor assumes personal 
liability to pay the mortgage money, it will be an anomalous mortgage. 
Again, a mortgagee may be given possession of the property for a fixed period 
with a condition that in case the debt is not discharged at the expiry of the period 
mentioned, the mortgage shall be regarded as a mortgage by conditional sale. In this 
case, the mortgage has got a right of "foreclosure" and after the expiry of the period if 
the debt is not paid, the mortgagee will become the owner of the property. 
Two other terms in common use in connection with mortgage may be considered 
here. These terms are (i) Sub-mortgage; and (ii) Puisne mortgage. 
(v)  Sub-mortgage: Where the mortgagee transfers by mortgage his interest in 
the mortgaged property, or creates a mortgage of a mortgage the transaction is 
known as a sub-mortgage. For example, where A mortgages his house to B for Rs. 
10,000 and B mortgage his mortgagee right to C for Rs. 8,000. B creates a sub-
mortgage. 
(vi)  Puisne mortgage: Where the mortgagor, having mortgaged his property, 
mortgages it to another person to secure another loan, the second mortgage is called 
a puisne mortgage. For example, where A mortgages his house worth Rs. one lakh to 
B for Rs. 40,000 and mortgages the same house to C for a further sum of Rs. 30,000, 
the mortgage to B is first mortgage and that to C the second or puisne mortgage. C is 
the puisne mortgagee, and can recover the debt subject to the right of B, the first 
mortgagee, to recover his debt of Rs. 40,000 plus interest.

Choose the correct answer 
Which of the following mortgages is called equitable mortgage in English law? 
 (a) Simple mortgage 
 (b) English mortgage 
 (c) Anomalous mortgage 
 (d) Mortgage by deposit of title deeds 
Correct Answer: (d) 
 
(vii)  Rights of mortgagor:  By mortgaging the property the mortgagor does not 
cease to be its owner, he only transfers an interest in it. The law, therefore, grants 
him the following rights: 
 (a) Right of redemption:  The first and the most important right of the 
mortgagor is the right to redeem i.e., take back the mortgaged property by 
paying the mortgage money at any time after the stipulated date for 
repayment. Section 60 of the Act provides that any time after the principal 
amount has become due, the mortgagor has a right to redeem the property. 
Although the Act gives him the right to redeem “any time” after their debt 
has become due, it enjoins upon the mortgagor the obligation to exercise 
this right (i) before the right is extinguished by the  Act of parties or by a 
decree of Court, or (ii) before it is barred by the Limitation Act. According to 
the Law of Limitation the, mortgagor can redeem the property within 60 
years after the money has become due. This right to redeem the property 
even after the time of payment has  elapsed is called the Right or Equity or 
Redemption. But the mortgagor is not entitled to redeem before the 
mortgage money becomes due on the date fixed for repayment of the loan. 
His right to redeem arises only when mortgage money becomes due and 
not before. 
 
 Let us take an example to illustrate this point. A borrows money on a 
mortgage and agrees to pay it back after 5 years. A has won a lottery  and 
wants to pay the loan at the end of 3 years and redeem his property. He 
cannot do so, because the right to redeem arises only when the money has 
become due at the end of 5 years. This is so because the mortgagee 
cannot file a suit against the mortgagor for the repayment of the loan. That 
is why it is said that the rights of the mortgagor and the mortgagee are co-
extensive. 
 (b) Right against clog on equity of redemption: Right of redemption or equity of 
redemption is the essence of a mortgage, and any provision inserted in the 
mortgage deed to prevent, evade or hamper redemption is void. Any 
condition which prevents the mortgagor from redeeming the property is 
called a “clog” on the equity or right of redemption and is void. The rule of 
equity that once a mortgage always a mortgage prohibits a clog on the right 
EP-GCL-4 
250 
of redemption. In other words, once a transaction is found to be a 
mortgage, the Court would not permit any condition in a mortgage deed 
which would prevent or impede redemption or repayment of the loan for 
which the security was given. For example, A borrows money on a 
mortgage from B and agrees to pay back the loan after 5 years. In the 
mortgage deed it is also stipulated that in default of redemption on a 
particular day the mortgage would be renewed for another period of 5 
years, that is to say, that mortgagor shall not redeem the property before 
the expiry of 10 years. This stipulation is a clog on redemption and is void 
as the provision gave a right of redemption for one day only in 10 years. A 
condition requiring payment at higher rate of interest in the event of 
mortgagor‟s failure to pay at the expiry of the stipulated time is invalid being 
a clog on equity of redemption; (Sunder Kaur v. Sham Krishan, (64 I.A. 9). 
Other Illustrations 
 
(a) A stipulation that the mortgagor shall not alienate the mortgaged 
property and that he could redeem that mortgage only by paying money 
out of his own pocket and not by money raised by transfer of property 
was held to be a clog (Ram Saran Lal v. Amrit Kaur, 3 All. 369). 
 
(b) A mortgage deed provided that if the mortgage money was not paid at 
a certain time, the mortgagee might enter into possession for a period 
of twelve years and that mortgagors right to redeem would remain 
suspended for that period. It was held the condition was a clog and 
therefore unenforceable (Mohd. Sher Khan v. Seth Swami Dayal, 49 
I.A. 60). 
 
(c) A deed of mortgage of shares of a company contained a clause 
whereby the mortgagee was to have the exclusive right of selling the 
company‟s tea as its broker. It was held as a clog on the equity of 
redemption (Bradley v. Carrit (1903) A.C. 253). 
 
(d) A mortgage deed provided that in case the payment was not made by 
the mortgagor within the stipulated period, the mortgagee would 
become the absolute owner of the property. It was held to be a clog on 
the equity of redemption. 
 
 Where, however, the condition is reasonable and does not prevent the 
mortgagor to redeem the property it will be recognised as valid and 
binding. For example, A mortgages his paddy field and borrows money 
from B, the mortgage being with possession (usufructuary mortgage). 
There is a condition in the mortgage deed that the mortgagor shall not 
redeem in the harvesting or cultivating season. The condition is 
reasonable, because if the mortgagor is allowed to redeem during 
harvesting season, it will cause some difficulty to the mortgagee. 
 
 Similarly, a condition that the mortgagor cannot redeem the 
mortgage for a certain number of years is valid and enforceable. 
Thus, in Knightbridge Estate Trust Limited v. Bysue, 1929 Ch. 441, 
it was agreed that the mortgagor could pay off the debt in 40 
years. It was held that such contract was not a clog on the equity 
of redemption. 
 
EP-GCL-4 
251 
 (c) Right of partial redemption: A mortgage, as a rule, being one and indivisible 
for the debt and every part of it, the mortgagor cannot redeem piecemeal; 
he must redeem the whole property. But Section 61 of the Act gives a right 
of partial redemption stating that “a mortgagor who has executed two or 
more mortgages in favour of the same mortgagee shall, in the absence of a 
contract to the contrary, when the principal money of any two or more of the 
mortgages has become due, be entitled to redeem any one such mortgage 
separately or any two or more of such mortgages together.” 
Illustrations  
 (a) A mortgages property X to B and obtains a loan of Rs. 2,000. A again 
mortgages the same property to B and obtains a further loan of Rs. 1,000. 
A can redeem the first mortgage of Rs. 2,000 or he can redeem both 
together. 
 (b) A mortgages property X to B and obtains a loan of Rs. 10,000. He then 
mortgages his property Y and obtains a loan of Rs. 10,000. He may redeem 
either property X or Y by paying the loan. The mortgagee cannot insist that 
A should redeem both mortgages together. 
(viii)  Implied contract by mortgagor.  The parties are free to enter into any terms 
they like. Where, however, the contract does not contain all the terms, Section 65 
provides for implied terms as follows: 
In the absence of a contract to the contrary, the mortgagor shall be deemed to 
have contracted with the mortgagee that the : 
 (a) mortgagor is entitled to transfer the interest (covenant for title); 
 (b) mortgagor will assist the mortgagee to enjoy quiet possession; 
 (c) mortgagor will pay public charges in respect of the mortgaged property; 
 (d) mortgagor covenants as to payment of the rent due on lease where, the 
mortgaged property is leased; 
 (e) mortgagor covenants as to payments of interest and principal on prior 
encumbrances, where the mortgage is a second or subsequent 
encumbrance on the property. 
Illustration 
 (a) A mortgagor fails to pay the Government revenue in respect of mortgaged 
property in time. The property had to be sold for arrears in Government 
revenue and the mortgagor himself purchases the property as a revenue 
sale. Thereafter, he executes another mortgage of the same property. Held 
that the original mortgage is not extinguished and he is liable to the first 
mortgagee. A mortgagor cannot take advantage of the breach of his 
obligation (Sonogopally v. Intoory, 26 Mad. 385). 
(ix)  Rights of mortgagee and his remedies:  If the mortgagor does not pay the 
mortgage money, the mortgagee may proceed to recover (i) from the mortgaged 
property, or (ii) sue for recovery from the mortgagor personally. Thus the mortgagor 
has two remedies: one against the property and the other against the mortgagor 
personally. 
EP-GCL-4 
252 
 (a) Remedies against the property:  The remedies of the mortgagee against 
the property are: 
 
(i) Right to bring property to sale. 
 
(ii) Right to foreclose. 
 
(iii) Right to the possession of the property. 
 
(i) Remedy by sale:  In case of a simple mortgage or a mortgage by deposit of 
title deeds or equitable mortgage, or an English mortgage, sale is the only 
remedy available to the mortgagee. He has to file a suit for sale of the 
mortgaged property and if the Court is satisfied, it would give 6 months time 
to the mortgagor to pay the decretal amount. If he fails to pay, the 
mortgagee will get a final decree under which he can have the  property 
sold. If the proceeds are more than the decretal amount, the balance, after 
payment to the mortgagee, will be paid to the mortgagor, and if the 
proceeds fall short, then a personal decree for the balance will be given 
against the mortgagor. 
 (ii) Foreclosure:  The second remedy is foreclosure, by means of a suit to get a 
decree that the mortgagor shall be absolutely debarred of his right to  
redeem the property, if the mortgagor does not pay within the period 
directed by the Court. After a foreclosure decree is passed the mortgagee 
becomes the owner of the property. This remedy is available only in the 
case of mortgage by conditional sale, or in any anomalous mortgage. 
 (iii) Possession: A usufructuary mortgagee has a right to file a suit for 
possession and by use of the property he can repay himself the debt due 
on him. He can retain possession until his debt is discharged out of the 
income of the property. Hence, where possession is not given by the 
mortgagor, the mortgagee sues for possession. 
 (iv) Right to sue for mortgage money:  According to Section 68, the mortgagee 
has a right to sue for the mortgage money in the following cases and not 
others: 
 
(a) where the mortgagor binds himself to repay the same; 
 
(b) where, by any cause other than the wrongful act or default of the 
mortgagor or mortgagee, the mortgage property is destroyed or the 
security is rendered insufficient; 
 
(c) where the mortgagee is deprived of the whole or part of his security by 
or in consequence of the wrongful act or default of the mortgagor; 
 (v) where the mortgagee, being entitled to the possession of the property 
(usufructuary mortgage), is not put in possession of it, or where having 
been put in possession, is dispossessed by the mortgagor or any other 
person claiming under a superior title, e.g., a buyer by a registered deed. 
 (vi) Right of private sale:  By virture of Section 69, a mortgagee can sell the 
property without the intervention of the Court if, the loan is not paid on a 
certain date, in the following cases: 
 
(a) where the mortgage is an English mortgage and neither the mortgagor 
nor the mortgagee is a Hindu, Mohammedan or Buddhist; or 
 
(b) where the mortgagee is the Government and the mortgage deed 
confers an express power of sale; or 
 
EP-GCL-4 
253 
 
(c) where the mortgage property was on the date of execution of the 
mortgage situated within the towns of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, or 
in any other town or area which the State Government may specify in 
this behalf and the mortgage-deed confers an express power of sale. 
Section 69(2) prescribes certain conditions to be observed before the power can 
be exercised. These conditions are imperative and cannot be varied even by 
agreement between the parties to the mortgage. 
This right of private sale shall not be exercised unless and until: 
 (a) notice in writing requiring payment of the principal money has been served 
on the mortgagor and default has been made in payment of the principal 
money or of part thereof, for three months after such service or 
 (b) some interest under the mortgage amounting at least to five hundred 
rupees in arrear and unpaid for three months after becoming due. 
The sale proceeds under a private sale must be utilised, first in discharging prior 
encumbrances, if any, secondly, on payment of all costs, charges and expenses of 
the sale; thirdly, the non-payment of the debt; and finally, the surplus to be paid to the 
person entitled to the mortgage property. 
(x) Liabilities of the mortgagee in possession:  According to Section 76, a 
mortgagee in possession is bound: 
 (a) to manage the property as a person of ordinary prudence would manage 
his own; 
 (b) to use his best endeavours to collect the rents and profits thereof; 
 (c) to pay out of the income all Government revenue or other charges of a 
public nature; 
 (d) not to commit any act which is destructive to the property; 
 (e) to keep full and accurate accounts of all income and expenditure; and 
 
(f) when the mortgagor tenders or deposits the mortgage money, to account 
for his receipts from the property from the date of tender or deposited etc. 
(xi)  Priority:  The general rule of priority of different mortgages on the same 
property is that the successive mortgage is paid after the prior mortgage has been 
satisfied. Thus, if two successive mortgages are created by mortgagor on the same 
property, and both cannot be satisfied out of the mortgaged property, the prior 
mortgagee will have the first right to satisfy his whole debt and the balance, if any, will 
go to the subsequent mortgagee. But where the prior mortgages suffers from fraud, 
misrepresentation or gross neglect, the subsequent mortgage shall have priority over 
prior mortgagee, or of any other person who has for consideration acquired an 
interest in any of the properties. 
(xii)  Marshalling:  According to Section 81, if the owner of two or more properties 
mortgages them to one person and then mortgages one or more of the properties to 
another person, the subsequent mortgagee is, in the absence of a contract to the 
contrary, entitled to have the prior mortgage-debt satisfied out of the property or 
properties not mortgaged to him, so far as the same will extend, but not so as to 
prejudice the rights of the prior mortgagee. 
EP-GCL-4 
254 
Illustration 
A mortgages properties X and Y to B. Then he mortgages property Y to C. 
Suppose B obtains a decree on his mortgage for the sale of properties X and Y which 
form security for his mortgage. Suppose further that B apples in execution to the 
Court for sale of property Y which is also mortgaged to C, C would be entitled to have 
the prior debt of B satisfied out of property X, and if the whole debt is not satisfied out 
of property X then and then alone, the property Y should be proceeded against B. 
(xiii)  Subrogation:  Section 91 of the T.P. Act, enumerates the persons who may 
sue for redemption. The primary right to redemption is given to the mortgagor under 
Section 60, but in addition to the mortgagor certain other persons are also entitled to 
redeem or institute a suit for redemption of the mortgaged property, namely : 
 (a) any person who has any interest in, or charge upon, the property 
mortgaged or in or upon the right to redeem the same; 
 (b) any surety for the payment of the mortgage-debt; or 
 (c) any creditor of the mortgagor who has in a suit for the administration of his 
estate obtained a decree for sale of the mortgaged property. 
Section 92 incorporates the principle of "subrogation". It provides that any of the 
persons referred to in Section 91 (other than the mortgagor) and any co-mortgagor 
shall, on redeeming property subject to the mortgage, have so far as regards 
redemption, foreclosure or sale of such property, the same rights as the mortgagee 
whose mortgage he redeems may have against the mortgagor or any other 
mortgagee. The right conferred by this Section is called the "right of subrogation", 
and a person acquiring the same is said to be subrogated to the rights of the 
mortgagee whose mortgage he redeems. 
A person who has advanced to a mortgagor money with which the mortgage has 
been redeemed shall be subrogated to the rights of the mortgagee whose mortgage 
has been redeemed, if the mortgagor has by a registered instrument agreed that 
such person shall be so subrogated. 
Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to confer a right of subrogation on any 
person unless the mortgage in respect of which the right is claimed has been 
redeemed in full. 
7.  Charges 
Meaning of charge:  "Charge" has been defined under Section 100 as follows:  
“Where immoveable property of one person is by the act of parties or operation of law 
made security for the payment of money to another, and the transaction does not 
amount to a mortgage, the latter person is said to have a charge on the property”. 
As is evident from the above definition, a charge comes into existence either by 
the act of parties or by operation of law. 
Charge by act of parties:  When in a transaction for value, both the parties 
(debtor and creditor) intend that the property existing or future shall be made 
available as security for the payment of a debt and that the creditor shall have a 
present right to have it made available, there is a charge. 
 
EP-GCL-4 
255 
Illustrations 
 (a) A inherited an estate from his grandfather and executed an agreement to 
pay his sister B a fixed annual sum out of the rents of estate. B has a 
charge on the estate. 
 (b) In a suit by A against B on the basis of a promissory note, the amount 
decreed was to be paid by instalments and B was not to dispose of his 
share in a company until the satisfaction of the decretal amount. Held, a 
charge was on B‟s share in the company and A was entitled to have the 
amount from the property even though B had sold his share to a third 
person. 
 (c) Hypothecation of property though not necessarily accompanied by 
possession of the property, does create a charge in favour of the creditor 
bank (HMT v. Nedungadi Bank Ltd. & Anr., AIR 1995 Kant 185). 
Charge by operation of law:  Charges created by law are those which arise on 
account of some statutory provisions. They are not created by the voluntary action of 
the parties but arise as a result of some legal obligation. 
Illustrations 
 (a) W files a suit against her husband H for maintenance. The Court grants a 
decree awarding the wife Rs. 100 per month, and in case of default by the 
husband makes his property liable for the amount of maintenance. Here a 
charge is created over the husband‟s property. 
 (b) An unpaid vendor has a charge on the property sold. 
 (c) A co-mortgagor redeeming the mortgage is entitled to claim contribution 
and acquires a charge in respect thereof. 
Floating charge:  A charge may be floating as well as fixed. A fixed charge is a 
charge on specific property but a floating charge is an equitable charge on the assets 
for time being of a going concern. It is peculiar to companies which are able to borrow 
money without any interference with their assets so long as they are going concern. 
In other words, it is a charge on a class of the assets of the company, present as well 
as future. The assets of the company are constantly undergoing a change but the 
creditors will not normally interfere with the assets of the company unless there is 
breach of some condition. As Professor Gower says, the assets are liquid and the 
charge is floating. It is ambulatory and shifting in its nature hovering over and so to 
speak floating with the property which it is intended to effect. As it does not attach to 
any specific property, it remains document until it crystallises. 
A floating charge has the following characteristics: 
 
1. It is a charge on class of assets both present and future. 
 
2. The class of assets charged is one which in the ordinary 
course of business would be changing from time to time. 
 
3. It is contemplated by the charge that until some future step is taken by 
those who are interested in the charge the company may carry on its 
business in the ordinary way, i.e., it may use its assets charged in the 
EP-GCL-4 
256 
? 
ordinary course of its business. (Per Roman L.J. in Reyork Shive Wool 
Combers Associated Limited, (1903) 2 Ch. 284) A floating charge is 
created by debentures on the company’s undertaking or its estate, 
property and effects. It is not necessary that the charge should be on 
all company’s assets. Thus a mortgage of a cinema and of the chattels 
used in the cinema premises was held to be a floating charge as to the 
chattles (National Provisional Bank of England Limited v. Charteb 
Electric Theatres Limited, (1916) Ch. 132). Similarly, a floating charge 
was created by a mortgage of book and other debts which shall become 
due during the continuance of this security (Reyork Shive Wool Combers 
Association, Supra). 
Crystallisation of floating charge 
A floating charge becomes fixed or crystallises in the following cases: 
 
1. When the money becomes payable under a condition in the debenture and 
the debenture holder, (i.e., the creditor) takes some steps to enforce the 
security; 
 
2. When the company ceases to carry on business; and 
 
3. When the company is being wound-up.

8.  Distinction between Mortgage and Charge 
Although in a charge, the property is made a security for the payment of the loan, 
yet the transaction does not amount to mortgage. It is important, therefore to 
distinguish between a charge and mortgage. 
 (a) A mortgage is transfer of an interest in the property made by the mortgagor 
as a security for the loan, while the charge is not the transfer of any interest 
in the property though it is security for the payment of an amount. 
 (b) A charge may be created by act of parties or by operation of law. A 
mortgage can only be created by act of parties. 
 (c) A mortgage deed must be registered and attested by two witnesses, while a 
charge need not be made in writing, and if reduced to writing, it need not be 
attested or registered. 
 (d) In certain types of mortgage (viz., mortgage by conditional sale and 
 
EP-GCL-4 
257 
anomalous mortgage) the mortgagor can foreclose the mortgaged property 
but in charge, the charge-holder cannot foreclose though he can get the 
property sold as in a simple mortgage. 
 (e) From the very nature of it, a charge as a general rule, cannot be enforced against 
a transferee for consideration without notice. But in a mortgage, the transferee of 
mortgaged property from the mortgagor, can only acquire the remaining interest of 
the mortgagor, and is therefore, only bound by the mortgage. 
 
(f) In a charge created by act of parties the specification of the particular fund 
or property negatives a personal liability and the remedy of the charge-
holder is against the property only. In a mortgage, there can be security as 
well as personal liability. In fact, the absence of a personal liability is the 
principal test that distinguishes a charge from a simple mortgage. 
    
LESSON ROUND-UP 
 
 
The law relating to transfer of property is governed by the Transfer of Property 
Act, 1882. „Transfer of Property‟ means an act by which a living person conveys 
property, in present or future, to one or more other living persons, or to himself, 
and one or more other living persons. „living person‟ includes a company or 
association or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not. 
 
Every person who is competent to contract and entitled to transferable property, 
or authorized to dispose of property is competent to transfer such property. 
Property can be transferred either orally or by writing. Moveable property can be 
transferred by delivery of possession or by registration. In the case of tangible 
immoveable property of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards, or in the 
case of a reversion or other intangible thing, transfer can be made only by a 
registered instrument. In the case of tangible immoveable property of a value less 
than one hundred rupees, such transfer may be made either by a registered 
instrument or by delivery of the property. 
 
When property is transferred, the transferee should not be restrained absolutely 
from alienating the property. One may give property to another subject to a 
condition, but the condition should not be one which absolutely prevents the 
transferee from alienating the property. A transfer may also be made subject to a 
contingency which may or may not occur. This is known as condition subsequent. 
Condition subsequent is one which destroys or divests the rights upon the 
happening or non-happening of an event.  
 
Section 35 of the Transfer of Property Act deals with what is called doctrine of 
election. Election may be defined as “the choosing between two rights where 
there is a clear intention that both were not intended to be enjoyed”. The 
foundation of doctrine of election is that a person taking the benefit of an 
instrument must also bear the burden, and he must not take under and against 
the same instrument. 
EP-GCL-4 
258 
 
Where, with the consent, express of implied, of the persons interested in 
immoveable property, a person is the ostensible owner of such property and 
transfers the same for consideration, the transfer shall not be voidable on the 
ground that the transferor was not authorized to make it, provided that the 
transferee, after taking reasonable care to ascertain that the transferor had power 
to make the transfer, has acted in good faith. This is called doctrine of Holding 
Out. 
 
Doctrine of Feeding the Grant by Estoppel means where, a person fraudulently or 
erroneously represents that he is authorized to transfer certain immoveable 
property and professes to transfer such property for consideration, such transfer 
shall, at the option of the transferee, operate on any interest which the transferor 
may acquire in such property at any time during which the contract of transfer 
subsists. 
 
Where a person transfers his property so that his creditors shall not have 
anything out of the property, the transfer is called a fraudulent transfer. A debtor 
in order to defeat or delay the rights of a creditor, may transfer his property to 
some person, who may be his relative or a friend. The law does not allow this. 
 
The Act does not allow accumulation of income from the land for an unlimited 
period without the income-being enjoyed by owner of the property. The law 
allows accumulation of income for a certain period only. The period for which 
such accumulation is valid is : (a) the life of the transferor, or (b) eighteen years 
from the date of transfer. Any direction to accumulate the income beyond the 
period mentioned above is void. However, this is subject to certain exceptions. 
 
Lis pendens means a pending suit, action, petition or the like. Section 52 of the 
T.P. Act incorporates the doctrine of Lis pendens. It states that during the 
pendency of a suit in a court of law, property which is subject to a litigation cannot 
be transferred. 
 
The Act expressly provides for special types of transfers such as sale, exchange, 
gift, mortgage and lease. In a sale, exchange and gift, there is a transfer of the 
ownership of property but mortgage is a transfer of an interest in specific 
immovable property and lease is a transfer of the right to enjoy immoveable 
property. 
 
Actionable claims are claims, to unsecured debts. If a debt is secured by the 
mortgage of immoveable property it is not an actionable claim, because the 
Section clearly excludes such a debt. 
 
Charge under the Act has been defined as “where immoveable property of one 
person is by the act of parties or operation of law made security for the payment 
of money to another, and the transaction does not amount to a mortgage, the 
latter person is said to have a charge on the property”. 
 
As is evident from the above definition, a charge comes into existence either by 
the act of parties or by operation of law. A charge may be floating as well as 
fixed. A fixed charge is a charge on specific property but a floating charge is an 
equitable charge on the assets for time being of a going concern. It is peculiar to 
companies which are able to borrow money without any interference with their 
assets so long as they are going concerns.

STUDY V 
LAW RELATING TO STAMPS 
 
 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
The Indian Stamp Act, 1899 is a fiscal legislation dealing with tax on transactions. The 
tax is levied on in the shape of stamps recording the transactions. In our country, 
documents are often executed without proper legal advice and lawyers are faced with 
a difficult situation when they find that the document to be put in the court is not 
properly stamped. Sometimes people are unduly taxed by over zealous officers. 
Therefore, it is essential for the students to be familiar with the law relating to stamp 
duties.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The Indian Stamp Act, 1899 is the law relating to stamps which consolidates and 
amends the law relating to stamp duty. It is a fiscal legislation envisaging levy of 
stamp duty on certain instruments. The Act is divided into eight Chapters and there is 
a schedule which contains the rates of stamp duties on various instruments.  
(a) Union List 
Union List, Entry 91 gives power to the Union Legislature to levy stamp duty with 
regard to certain instruments (mostly of a commercial character). They are bill of 
exchange, cheques, promissory notes, bill of lading, letters of credit, policies of 
insurance, transfer of shares, debentures, proxies and receipt. The power to reduce 
or remit duties on these instruments is vested in the Union Government as per 
Section 9 of the Act.  
(b) The State Legislature 
State List, entry 63 confers on the States power to prescribe the rates of stamp 
duties on other instruments. As per ―Principles‖ for levy of duty fall in the Concurrent 
List, entry 44.  
(c) Amendments, entry 44 
The amendments to the Central Act effected by the States are in the shape of 
amendment of sections of the Central Act, adding new sections, adding separate 
schedules, modifying in schedules, etc. Some States, for their convenience, have 
passed separate legislation to cover the matters coming under State‘s domain. As a 
result, the rates of stamp duties in different States on other instruments category 
differ from State to State for the same instrument.  
2. IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS 
Section 2 of the Act contains definitions of various terms used in the Act. Some 
important definitions are discussed below: 
Banker  
―Banker‖ includes a bank and any person acting as a banker [Section 3 of the 
Negotiable Instruments Act defines a banker as including persons or a corporation or 
company acting as bankers]. [Section 2(1)] 
Bill of Lading 
―Bill of Lading‖ includes a ‗through bill lading‘ but does not include a mate‘s 
receipt. [Section 2(4)] 
A bill of lading is a receipt by the master of a ship for goods delivered to him for 
delivery to X or his assigns. Three copies are made, each signed by the master. One 
is kept by the consignor of the goods, one by the master of the ship and one is 
forwarded to X, the consignee, who, on receipt of it, acquires property in the goods. It 
is a written evidence of a contract for the carriage and delivery of goods by sea, for 
certain freight.  
EP-GCL-5 
262 
When goods are delivered on board a ship, the receipt is given by the person 
incharge at that time. This receipt is known as the mate‘s receipt. The shipper of the 
goods returns this receipt to the master before the ship leaves and receives from him 
bill of lading for the goods, signed by the master.  
Conveyance 
The term ―conveyance‖ includes a conveyance on sale and every instrument by 
which property (whether movable or immovable) is transferred inter vivos1 and which 
is not otherwise specifically provided for by Schedule. It does not include a will. 
[Section 2(10)] 
Thus, all transfers of property whether movable or immovable, on sale (which are 
not otherwise specially provided for by the Schedule), are chargeable as 
conveyances. Transfers which are otherwise provided for in the Schedule are 
Composition Deed, Exchange of Property, Gift, Lease, Mortgage, Reconveyance, 
Release, Settlement, Transfer, Transfer of Lease and (Declaration of) Trust.  
Instrument 
Section 2(14) defines an ―instrument‖ to include every document by which any 
right or liability is, or purports to be, created, transferred, limited, extended, 
extinguished or recorded. The definition is an inclusive definition, and is not 
necessarily restricted to those documents which are specifically mentioned in the 
definition. Briefly stated, an instrument includes conveyances, leases, mortgages, 
promissory notes and wills, but not ordinary letters or memoranda or accounts.  
Following instances may be noted: 
 
(i) An unsigned draft document is not an ―instrument‖ (because it does not 
create or purport to create any right, etc). 
 (ii) An entry in a register, containing the terms of hiring of machinery is an 
―instrument‖, where it is authenticated by the thumb impression of the hirer. 
(Reason is, that it purports to create, a liability etc.) 
 (iii) A letter which acknowledges receipt of a certain sum as having been 
borrowed at a particular rate of interest and for a particular period and that 
it will be repaid with interest on the due date is an ―instrument‖.  
 
 [These examples show, that the law looks to the substance and effect (or 
intended effect) of the text of the instrument and not the physical medium 
through which it is recorded.] 
 (iv) Photocopy of an agreement is not an instrument as defined under Section 
2(14) of the Act. Ashok Kalam Capital Builders v. State & Anr., AIR 2010 
(NOC) 736 (Del). 
Executed / Execution 
Under Section 1(12), the words ―executed‖ and ―execution‖ (used with 
reference to instruments), mean ―signed‖ and ―signature‖ respectively.  
Signature includes mark by an illiterate person. [Section 3(52), General 
Clauses Act, 1897] 
                                                     
1. The expression “inter vivos” means during lifetime. 
 
EP-GCL-5 
263 
An instrument which is chargeable with stamp duty only on being ―executed‖ is 
not liable to stamp duty until it is signed.  
The Collector can receive the stamp duty without penalty and certify an 
instrument as duly stamped, as from the date of execution. (Sections 37 and 40)  
Impressed Stamp 
According to Section 2(13), ―impressed stamp‖ includes: 
 (a) labels affixed and impressed by the proper officer; and 
 (b) stamps embossed or engraved on stamp paper.  
The rules framed under the Act invariably prescribe to what documents 
impressed stamps are to be used. The term includes both a stamp impressed 
by the Collector and also a stamp embossed on stamp paper. Special 
adhesive stamps are labels (Ganga Devi v. State of Bihar, 1 LR 45 Pat. 198).  
The instrument is duly stamped if it has been duly stamped at the time 
of execution and is admissible in evidence, though the stamp is 
subsequently removed or lost (Mt. Mewa Kunwari v. Bourey, AIR 1934 
All. 388).  
Bill of Exchange 
According to Section 2(2), ―bill of exchange‖ means a bill of exchange as 
defined in the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and includes also a Hundi and any 
other document entitling or purporting to entitle any person, whether named therein 
or not, to payment by any other person of, or to draw upon any other person for, 
any sum of money. The Negotiable Instruments Act, defines a ―bill of exchange‖ as 
an instrument in writing, containing an unconditional order signed by the maker, 
directing a certain person to pay a certain sum of money only to, or to the order of, 
a certain person or to the bearer of the instrument.  
Bill of exchange payable on demand 
Under Section 2(3) of the Stamp Act, a ―bill of exchange on demand‖ includes: 
 (a) an order for the payment of any sum of money by a bill of exchange or 
promissory note or for the delivery of any bill of exchange or promissory note 
in satisfaction of any sum of money, or in the payment of any sum of money 
out of any particular fund which may or may not be available, or upon any 
condition or contingency which may or may not be performed or happen;  
 (b) an order for the payment of any sum of money weekly, monthly or at any 
other said period; and 
 (c) a letter of credit, that is to say, any instrument by which one person 
authorises any other person to give credit to the person in whose favour it 
is drawn.  
It may be noted that a bill of exchange payable on demand includes even a 
letter of credit, as per above definition.  
EP-GCL-5 
264 
? 
Thus, the definition in the Stamp Act includes many instruments which could 
not be classed as ‗bills of exchange‘ within the definition given by the Negotiable 
Instruments Act, 1881. 
Cheque 
Under Section 2(7) of the Stamp Act, ―cheque‖ means a bill of exchange drawn 
on specified banker, not expressed to be payable otherwise than on demand. This 
definition follows the definition given in the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.  
It should be mentioned that in India, cheques are no longer subject to stamp 
duty. Entry 21 in the Schedule levying duty on cheque was deleted by Act 5 of 
1927.  
Bond 
Under Section 2(5), a ―bond‖ includes –  
 (a) any instrument whereby a person obliges himself to pay money to another 
on condition that the obligation shall be void if a specified act is performed, 
or is not performed, as the case may be; 
 (b) any instrument attested by a witness not payable to order or bearer, 
whereby a person obliges himself to pay money to another; and 
 (c) any instrument so attested, whereby a person obliges himself to deliver 
grain or other agricultural produce to another.  
The word ―oblige‖ has been used in all sub-clauses in the definition. Therefore, 
no document can be a bond unless it is one which, by itself, creates the obligation 
to pay the money. The words ―obliges himself to pay money‖ make it very clear, 
that the obligation is not a pre-existing one. Where the liability already exists it 
cannot be said that under a subsequent document (merely reproducing the nature 
of the obligation) an obligation has been created.

Which of the following is the instrument in writing, containing an unconditional order 
signed by the maker? 
 (a) Bill of Exchange 
 (b) Cheque 
 (c) Impressed Stamp 
 (d) Marketable Security 
Correct answer: (a) 
 
Chargeable 
Under Section 2(6) ―chargeable‖ as applied to an instrument executed or first 
executed after the commencement of the Act means chargeable under the Act and 
 
EP-GCL-5 
265 
as applied to any other instrument, chargeable under the law in force in India when 
such instrument was executed or where several persons executed the instrument at 
different times, first executed.  
Lease 
―Lease‖ means a lease of immovable property and includes also: 
 (a) a patta; 
 (b) a kabuliyat or other undertaking in writing, not being a counterpart of a 
lease to cultivate, occupy or pay or deliver rent for, immovable property; 
 (c) any instrument by which tolls of any description are let;  
 (d) any writing on an application for a lease intended to signify that the 
application is granted. [Section 2(16)] 
Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act defines lease as a transfer of a right 
to enjoy such property, made for a certain time, expressed or implied, or in 
perpetuity, in consideration of a price paid or promised, or of money, a share of 
crops, service or any other thing of value to be rendered periodically or on specified 
occasions to the transferor by the transferee, who accepts the transfer on such 
terms.  
A patta is an instrument given by the Collector of District or any other receiver 
of the revenue, to the cultivator, specifying the condition or conditions upon which 
the lands are to be held and the value or proportion of the produce to be paid 
therefor.  
A Kabuliyat is executed by the lessee, accepting the terms of the lease and 
undertaking to abide by them. Although, it is not a lease under Section 105 of the 
Transfer of Property Act, it is expressly included in the definition for the purposes of 
the Stamp Act.  
Toll is a tax paid for some liberty or privilege, such as for passage over a 
bridge, ferry, along a highway or for the sale of articles in a market or fair or the 
like. It does not include ‗octroi’ or ‗chungi‘.  
Promissory Note 
It means a promissory note as defined by the Negotiable Instruments Act, 
1881. It also includes a note promising the payment of any sum of money out of a 
particular fund which may or may not be available, or upon any condition or 
contingency which may or may not be performed or happen. [Section 2(22)] 
Requisities of a promissory note as per the Negotiable Instruments 
Act, 1881 are the following: 
 
(a) the document must contain an unconditional undertaking to 
pay; 
 (b) the undertaking must be to pay money only;  
 (c) the money to be paid must be certain; 
 (d) it must be payable to or to the order of a certain person or to bearer; 
 (e) the document must be signed by the maker.  
EP-GCL-5 
266 
Illustrations 
An instrument in the form: 
―I do acknowledge myself to be indebted to B in Rs. 1,000 to be paid on 
demand for value received‖ is a promissory note.  
―I have received a sum of £20 which I borrowed from you and I have to be 
accountable for the sum with interest‖ held not to be a promissory note.  
―On demand I promise to pay to the trustees of W&C or their treasurer for the 
time being £100‖ was held a good promissory note.  
Receipt 
―Receipt‖ includes any note, memorandum or writing: 
 (a) whereby any money or any bill of exchange, cheque or promissory note is 
acknowledged to have been received; or 
 (b) whereby any other movable property is acknowledged to have been 
received in satisfaction of a debt; or 
 (c) whereby any debt or demand, or any part of a debt or demand is 
acknowledged to have been satisfied or discharged; or 
 (d) which signifies or imports any such acknowledgement, and whether the 
same is or is not signed with the name of any person. [Section 2(23)] 
A mere acknowledgement in writing of the receipt of immovable property will 
not attract sub-clause (b). Under sub-clause (c), any acknowledgement in 
satisfaction or discharge of any debt or demand or any part thereof is covered; for 
instance, a receipt given by the secretary or other manager of a club 
acknowledging payment of the club dues comes within the sub-clause.  
An ordinary cash memo issued by a shopkeeper or another person selling the 
goods or other merchandise is not a receipt, unless it contains an 
acknowledgement of receipt of the money.  
A letter acknowledging the receipt of money or cheque is a receipt. A document 
merely saying that the signatory has received a sum of Rs. 500 is a receipt.  
Settlement 
―Settlement‖ means any non-testamentary disposition, in writing, of movable or 
immovable property made: 
 (a) in consideration of marriage; 
 (b) for the purpose of distributing property of the settler among his family or 
those for whom he desires to provide, or for the purpose of providing for 
some person dependent on him; or 
 (c) for any religious or charitable purpose;  
and includes an agreement in writing to make such disposition. [Section 2(24)] 
The definition of ―settlement‖ excludes a will. A will is intended to operate only 
on death, while a settlement operates immediately.

Marketable Security 
Under Section 2(16A), ―marketable security‖ means a security of such a 
description as to be capable of being sold in stock market in India or in the United 
Kingdom. 
Stamp 
―Stamp‖ means any mark, seal or endorsement by any agency or person duly 
authorized by the State Government and includes an adhesive or impressed stamp 
for the purposes of duty chargeable under this Act. This definition of the stamp has 
been inserted by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2004.

3. INSTRUMENTS CHARGEABLE WITH DUTY 
Section 3 of the Act is the charging section. It provides that subject to the 
provisions of the Act and the exemptions contained in Schedule I, the following 
instruments shall be chargeable with a duty of the amount indicated in that 
Schedule as the proper duty therefor, namely: 
 (a) every instrument mentioned in that Schedule which, not having been 
previously executed by any person, is executed in India on or after the first 
day of July, 1899; 
 (b) every bill of exchange payable otherwise than on demand or promissory 
note drawn or made out of India on or after the date and accepted or paid, 
or presented for acceptance or payment, or endorsed, transferred or 
otherwise negotiated in India; and 
 (c) every instrument (other than a bill of exchange or promissory note) 
mentioned in that Schedule, which, not having been previously executed by 
any person, is executed out of India on or after that day and relates to any 
property situate, or to any matter or thing done or to be done in India and is 
received in India.  
However, no duty shall be chargeable in respect of: 
 
1. any instrument executed by or on behalf of or in favour of the Government, 
in cases where, but for this the Government would be liable to pay the duty 
chargeable in respect of such instrument.  
EP-GCL-5 
268 
 
2. any instrument for the sale, transfer or disposition, either absolutely or by 
way of mortgage or otherwise, of any ship or vessel or any part, interest, 
share of property of or in any ship or vessel registered under the Merchant 
Shipping Act, 1894 or under Act XIX of 1838 or the Indian Registration of 
Ships Act, 1841 as amended by subsequent Acts.  
 
 [The references to repealed Acts are now to be read as references to the 
corresponding re-enacting Act].  
 
3. Any instrument executed by, or, on behalf of, or in favour of, the Developer 
or Unit or in connection with the carrying out of purposes of the special 
Economic Zone. 
Explanation – For the purposes of this clause, the expressions ―Developer‖ 
―Special Economic Zone‖ and ―Unit‖ shall have meanings respectively assigned to 
them in Clauses (g), (za) and (zc) of Section 2 of the Special Economic Zones Act, 
2005.* 
Thus, Section 3 charges certain instruments to be liable to stamp duty.  
The Court has observed as under in Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. G. 
Angus, 1889) 23 QBD 579, followed in re Swadeshi Cotton Mills, AIR 1932 All 291, 
―the first thing to be noticed is that thing which is made liable to duty is an 
instrument. If a contract of purchase and sale or a conveyance by way of purchase 
and sale, can be, or is carried out without an instrument the case is not within the 
section and no tax is imposed. It is not the transaction of purchase and sale which 
is struck at; it is the instrument whereby the purchase and sale are effected which 
is struck at. And if any one carries through a purchase and sale without an 
instrument, then the Legislature has not reached that transaction‖.  
In re Swadeshi Cotton Mills, AIR 1932 All 291, it was held that if after entry into 
a contract of sale the parties (in spite of the risk that either 
party may resile from the contract), refrain from getting an 
actual deed of conveyance prepared, they can successfully 
evade the payment of higher duty. It is no argument that the 
Government 
loses 
revenue, 
if 
such 
a 
course 
is 
permitted**.
 
On this point Esher M.R., in Commissioners of Inland 
Revenue v. G. Angus, (1889) 23 QBD 579, stated that “goodwill can be sold 
and conveyed to purchasers without any „conveyance‟ being executed and if 
you treat the document as only an agreement with regard to the goodwill, 
there will never be any conveyance executed and the property would have 
been transferred to the purchaser without the Crown getting any ad valorem 
duty upon the transfer. If a vendor can convey the property sold to the 
purchaser without the execution of any instrument, he can convey it without 
paying any duty under Section 70. The subject may have the good fortune to 
escape the stamp duty, if he can get a conveyance of property sold to him 
without the execution of any instrument….. “The Crown ….. must make out its 
right to duty and if there be a means of evading the stamp duty, so much the 
better for those who can evade it”.  
                                                     
* Clause 3 mentioned above has been inserted by the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005. 
** However, in some States, local amendments have imposed heavy duty on agreements for sale.

Substance and description 
Courts have invariably upheld the principle of substance of the transaction, over 
the form, in the matter of deciding the nature of the instrument. The substance of 
the transaction contained in the document may not necessarily embody the 
description given at the head thereof.  
It is the substance of the transaction as contained in the instrument and not the 
form of the instrument, that determines the stamp duty, though the duty is leviable 
on the instrument and not on the transaction. In determining whether a document 
comes within the description of a document upon which a stamp is required by the 
Act, one has to look at the entire document to find out whether it falls within the 
description. Where a single instrument contains several purposes, the instrument 
as a whole should be read to find out its dominant purpose. To determine whether a 
document is sufficiently stamped the Court must look at the document itself, as it 
stands.

SETTLEMENT) 
Section 4 provides that, where in the case of any sale, mortgage or settlement, 
several instruments are employed for completing the transaction –  
 (a) only the principal instrument shall be chargeable with the duty prescribed 
for the conveyance, mortgage or settlement; and 
 (b) each of the other instruments shall be chargeable with a duty of one rupee 
(instead of the duty if any prescribed for the other instruments).  
Illustrations (Section 4 held applicable) 
 
(i) A executed a conveyance of immovable property. On the same deed his 
nephew (undivided in status) endorsed his consent to the sale, as such 
consent was considered to be necessary. It was held that the conveyance 
was the principal instrument. The consent was chargeable with only one 
rupee (ILR 13 Bom 281). 
 (ii) Subsequent to a sale of immovable property, two declarations were 
executed reciting that the sale was subject to an equitable mortgage 
created by the vendor. These declarations were held to be chargeable, 
together with the sale deed, as having completed the conveyance (Somaiya 
Organics Ltd. v. Chief Controlling Revenue Authority, AIR 1972 All 252). 
 (iii) Brother A executed in favour of brother B a gift of all his property. By 
another deed, brother B made provision for the living expenses of brotherA 
and hypothecating in favour of brother A a part of the property included in 
the above mentioned gift deed, in order to secure the payment of the living 
expenses. It was held that the two documents were part of the same 
transaction. They amounted to a settlement and Section 4 applied (Maharaj 
Someshar Dutt, ILR 37 All 264). 
 (iv) B conveyed the whole of his property to three persons who undertook to 
provide for him and to perform his obsequies. By another document, the 
EP-GCL-5 
270 
three donees agreed to provide for B. This was mentioned in the deed 
executed by A also. It was held that the two documents had to be construed 
as part of the same act; the first was liable to duty as a conveyance while 
the second was liable to a duty of Rupee 1 only (Dadoba v. Krishna, ILR 7 
Bom. 34).  
 (v) A company executed, first a deed of trust and mortgage stating that the 
company was to issue notes for raising loans secured by the sale deed. It 
was held as under: 
 
(1) The deed was principal or primary security (and not a collateral 
security). It was chargeable as mortgage under Article 14. 
 
(2) The notes issued subsequently were debentures and not principal 
instruments (Madras Refinery Ltd. v. Chief Controlling Revenue 
Authority, Madras, AIR 1977 SC 500). 
 (vi) The Rangoon Gymkhana executed a duly stamped trust deed, mortgaging 
its assets as security for the repayment of the debenture stock issued by it. 
In addition, it had issued certificates of debenture stock to the subscribers, 
but these did not contain any promise to repay any need, but merely stated 
the amount standing in each stock holder‘s name. It was held that the 
certificates were not debentures, but were instruments employed to 
complete the mortgage [Rangoon Gymkhana In re, AIR 1927 Rang. 37 
(Section 4 applied)]. 
5. SECTION 4 NOT APPLICABLE  
 
(i) A lease is executed and got registered. A second document is executed 
altering the terms of the first document. The second document has to be 
stamped as a lease. Section 4 does not apply. 
 (ii) A purchaser of land executes a mortgage of the land in favour of the vendor 
for a portion of the purchase money. The mortgage is liable to full duty as a 
separate instrument. Section 4 does not apply.  
Instruments relating to several distinct matters 
Under Section 5, an instrument comprising or relating to several distinct matters 
is chargeable with the aggregate amount of the duties with which each separate 
instrument, relating to one of such matters, would be chargeable under the Act 
(This is the reverse of the situation governed by Section 4).  
The Section deals with multifarious instruments. The expression ―distinct 
matter‖ means distinct transactions (Ram Swarup v. Joti, (1933) Allahabad Law 
Journal 427; Board of Revenue, Madras v. Narasimhan, AIR 1961 Mad 504). 
Section 5 applies even where the two (or more) matters are of the same 
description.  
Illustrations as to “distinct matters” 
 
(i) A document containing both an agreement for the dissolution of a 
partnership and a bond, is chargeable with the aggregate of the duties with 
which two such separate instruments would be chargeable. The two are 
 
EP-GCL-5 
271 
―distinct matters‖ (Chinmoyee Basu v. Sankare Prasad Singh, AIR 1955 
Cal. 561 (cf. AIR 1936 Lah. 449). 
 (ii) An agreement containing two covenants making certain properties 
chargeable in the first instance and creating a charge over certain 
properties if the first mentioned properties are found insufficient does 
not fall within Section 5 (Tek Ram v. Maqbul Shah, AIR 1928 Lah. 370). 
 (iii) A grant of annuity by several persons requires only one stamp (because 
there is only one transaction).  
 (iv) A lease to joint tenants requires only one stamp. 
 (v) A conveyance by several persons jointly relating to their separate interest in 
certain shares in an incorporated company requires only one stamp.  
 (vi) A power of attorney executed by several persons authorising the agent to 
do similar acts for them in relation to different subject matter is chargeable 
under Section 5, where they have no common interest.  
 (vii) Where a person having a representative capacity (as a trustee) and a 
personal capacity delegates his powers in both the capacities, section 5 
applies. In law, a person acting as a trustee is a different entity from the 
same person acting in his personal capacity.  
 (viii) The position is the same where a person is an executive or 
administrator and signs an instrument containing a disposition by him 
in his personal capacity and also a disposition as executor. The two 
capacities are different (Member, Board of Revenue v. Archur Paul 
Benthall, AIR 1956 SC 35). 
Principal and ancillary 
The test is – ―What is the leading object? Which is principal and which is 
ancillary?  
If an instrument taken with reference to its primary object is exempted then 
stamp duty cannot be charged merely because matter ancillary to it is included and 
that matter is chargeable to stamp duty. A very common example of this is an 
agreement for sale of goods, which also contains an arbitration clause. The latter 
clause is incidental to the former agreement. Where a deed of dissolution of 
partnership contains a clause charging the partnership assets for payment of 
certain amounts to outgoing parties, the instrument is chargeable separately for the 
charge and the partnership. The former is not ancillary to the latter.  
Where a document contains a transfer of mortgage and an agreement to make 
a loan, the mortgage and the loan are distinct matters and separately chargeable.  
If in a lease there is also an agreement to pay a certain sum on account of the 
balance of previous year, the document is chargeable (I) as a lease and (ii) also as 
a bond.  
A lease reserving separately rent for house and rent for furniture is chargeable 
separately for each of the items.  
Where, at an auction, a purchaser purchases several lots and there is only one 
instrument in respect of all of them the separate purchases are, nevertheless, 
EP-GCL-5 
272 
separate and distinct matters and so, the stamp duty must be determined 
separately.  
Thus, the test usually adopted is the test of ―leading object‖. If there is only one 
leading object, Section 5 will not apply. But if there are several distinct contracts, 
each is taxable.  
6. INSTRUMENTS COMING WITHIN SEVERAL DESCRIPTIONS IN SCHEDULE-I 
There may be cases where an instrument may come under several descriptions 
in Schedule-I to the Act. In such a circumstance, Section 6 of the Act provides that 
the instrument shall, where the duties chargeable thereunder are different, be 
chargeable only with the highest of such duties. Section 6 is subject to the 
provisions of Section 5. However, nothing in the Act shall render chargeable, with 
duty exceeding one rupee, a counter part or duplicate, of any instrument 
chargeable with duty, in respect of which the proper duty has been paid.  
Section 6 applies only where the instrument contains only one matter, but falls 
within two or more items in the Schedule. Section 6 covers cases where the 
instrument does not cover distinct matters but is ambiguous in regard to the various 
entries given in Schedule-I to the Act. In such cases, Section 6 clearly provides that 
the highest of the duties mentioned against the various descriptions against which 
the instrument is likely to fall is to be paid.  
Where a deed (I) contains a stipulation binding the executant to deliver his 
sugarcane crop to the obligee under the deed and (ii) also provides that the 
sugarcane crop is hypothecated as security for payment of money advanced by the 
obligee, the deed fulfills the dual character of the mortgage and a bond and is 
therefore chargeable to the highest of the duties by virtue of section 6. Similarly, 
where an attested instrument, containing an undertaking to pay money, evidences 
also a pledge of immovable property as security for the money due, the higher of 
the stamp duty payable on its character as a bond and on its character as a pledge, 
was held leviable. An instrument which can be treated both as a dissolution of 
partnership and as an instrument of partition has to be charged to the duty 
prescribed for partition deed, which is the higher of the two.  
7. BONDS, DEBENTURES, ETC. ISSUED UNDER THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
LOAN ACT, 1879 
Section 8 provides that any local authority raising a loan under the provisions of 
the Local Authorities Loans Act, 1879 or of any other law for the time being in force 
by the issue of bonds, debentures or other securities, shall, in respect of such 
loans, be chargeable with a duty of one percent on the total amount of the bonds, 
debentures or other securities issued by it. Such bonds, debentures or other 
securities need not be stamped and shall not be chargeable with any further duty 
on renewal, consolidation, sub-division or otherwise. This is so notwithstanding 
anything contained in the Indian Stamp Act: In the event of willful neglect to pay the 
duty required by this section, the local authority shall be liable to forfeit to the 
Government, a sum equal to 10 percent of the amount of duty payable and a like 
penalty for every month after the first, during which the neglect continues.

depository, 
shall not be liable to duty under this Act or any other law for the time being in force. 
Explanation 1 – For the purposes of this section, the expressions ―beneficial 
ownership‖, ―depository‖ and ―issuer‖ shall have the meanings respectively 
assigned to them in clauses (a), (e) and (f) of Sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the 
Depositories Act, 1996. 
Explanation 2 – For the purposes of this section, the expression ―securities‖

Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956. 
7B. CORPORATISATION AND DEMUTUALISATION SCHEMES AND RELATED 
INSTRUMENTS NOT LIABLE TO DUTY 
Section 8B has been inserted by the Finance Act, 2005, w.e.f. 13.5.2005.

pursuant to a scheme,  
as approved by the Securities and Exchange Board of India under Sub-section (2)

8. REDUCTION, REMISSION AND COMPOUNDING OF DUTIES 
Section 9 empowers the Government, (Central or the State as the case may 
be), to reduce or remit, whether prospectively, or retrospectively, the duties payable 
on any instrument or class of instruments or in favour of particular class of persons 
or members of such class. Section 9 also empowers the Central Government to 
provide for the composition or consolidation of duties of policies of insurance and in 
the case of issues by any incorporated company or other body corporate or of 
transfers where there is single transferee (whether incorporated or not) of 
debentures, bonds or other marketable securities.  
9. VALUATION FOR DUTY UNDER THE ACT 
Sections 20 to 28 (Chapter II of the Act) deal with valuation of instruments for 
duty. 
 (a) According to Section 20, where an instrument is chargeable with ad 
valorem duty in respect of any money expressed in any currency other than 
that of India, such duty shall be calculated on the value of such money in 
the currency of India, according to the current rate of exchange on the date 
of the instrument. The Central Government notifies from time to time, in the 
Official Gazette the rate of exchange for conversion of certain foreign 
currencies into Indian currency for this purpose and such rate shall be 
deemed to be the current rate.  
 (b) Section 21 provides that in the case of an instrument chargeable with ad 
valorem duty in respect of any stock or any marketable or other security, 
such duty shall be calculated on the value of such stock or security 
according to the average price or the value thereof on the date of the 
instrument. The term ―marketable security‖ has been defined in  
Section 2(16-A) of the Act.  
 
 Where the shares are quoted on the stock exchange, it is easy to ascertain 
the price of the shares or stock. However, where the shares or stocks are 
 
EP-GCL-5 
275 
not quoted on any stock exchange, the valuation has to be based upon the 
average of the latest private transactions, which can generally be 
ascertained from the principal officer of the concerned company or 
corporation. If, there have been no dealings at all, then unless some other 
reliable evidence of market value is forthcoming the value is to be taken at 
par. Section 22 of the Act, however, provides that if such price or value is 
mentioned in the instrument for the purpose of calculating duty, it shall be 
presumed (untill the contrary is proved) to be correct.  
 (c) Section 23 provides that where interest is expressly made payable by the 
terms of the instrument, such instrument shall not be chargeable with a 
duty higher than that with which it would have been chargeable, had no 
mention of interest been made therein. For instance, a promissory note for 
Rs. 10,000 is drawn with the recital of interest at the rate of 18 percent per 
annum, payable by the promissor; stamp is leviable on the basis that the 
instrument is for Rs. 10,000 only. 
 (d) Section 23A provides that in the case of an instrument (not being a 
promissory note or bill of exchange) which - 
 
(i) is given upon the occasion of the deposit of any marketable security by 
way of security for money advanced or to be advanced by way of loan, 
or for an existing or future debt, or 
 
(ii) makes redeemable or qualifies a duly stamped transfer, intended as a 
security, of any marketable security. 
 
 It shall be chargeable with duty as if it were an agreement or memorandum 
of an agreement, chargeable with duty under Article 5(c) of Schedule I to 
the Act.  
 (e) A release or discharge of any such instrument shall be chargeable only with 
the like duty.  
 
(f) According to Section 24, where any property is transferred to any person in 
consideration (wholly or in part) of any debt due to him, or subject either 
certainly or contingently to the payment or transfer of any money or stock, 
(whether being or constituting a charge or incumbrance upon the property 
or not), such debt, money or stock is to be deemed the whole or part, (as 
the case may be), of the consideration in respect whereof the transfer is 
chargeable with ad valorem duty. However, nothing in this section shall 
affect such a certificate of sale as is mentioned in Article 18 of the First 
Schedule to the Act.  
The object of this section is that, upon every purchase ad valorem duty has to 
be paid on the entire consideration which either directly or indirectly represents the 
value of the free and unencumbered corpus of the subject matter of the sale 
(Collector of Ahmedabad v. Deepak Textile Industries, AIR 1966 Guj. 227).  
What Section 24 means is that where property is sold subject to the payment 
by the purchaser, discharging a debt charged on the property, then the purchaser is 
really paying a consideration which includes the amount of that debt also (Somayya 
Organics Ltd. v. Board of Revenue, AIR 1986 SC 403). 
EP-GCL-5 
276 
Proviso to Section 24 operates for the benefit of assignee of the mortgage.  
When the mortgaged property is sold to the mortgagee along with other 
properties, the stamp duty already paid is to be deducted from the duty payable on 
the deed of sale. In order to entitle the mortgagee to a deduction of the duties 
payable the entire property mortgaged should be transferred and not merely a 
portion of it (In re Mirabai, in re Laxman and Ganpat, ILR 29 Bom. 203).  
Explanation to Section 24 provides that in the case of sale of property subject 
to mortgage or other encumbrances, any unpaid mortgage money or money 
charged together with the interest, if any, due on the same shall be deemed to be 
part of the consideration for the sale provided that where property subject to a 
mortgage is transferred to the mortgagee he shall be entitled to deduct from the 
duty payable on the transfer the amount of any duty already paid in respect of the 
mortgage. Three illustrations which have been appended to the Section are as 
under: 
 
(i) A owes B Rs. 1,000/-. A sells a property to B, the consideration being Rs. 
500/- and the release of the previous debt of Rs. 1,000/-. Stamp duty is 
payable on Rs. 1,500/- 
 (ii) A sells a property to B for Rs. 500 which is subject to a mortgage to C for 
Rs. 1,000/- and unpaid interest Rs. 200/-. Stamp duty is payable on 1,700. 
 (iii) A mortgages a house of the value of Rs. 10,000/- to B for Rs. 5,000/-. B 
afterwards buys the house from A. Stamp duty is payable on Rs. 10,000/- 
less the amount of stamp duty already paid for the mortgage.  
 (g) Section 25 deals with the manner of computation of duty in the case of 
annuities. Valuation of an annuity will be material, where the payment of 
annuity or other sum payable periodically is secured by an instrument or 
where the consideration for a conveyance is an annuity or other sum 
payable periodically. In such cases, the amount secured by such instrument 
or the consideration for such conveyance, as the case may be, shall be 
deemed to be: 
 
(i) where the sum payable is for a definite period so that the total amount 
to be paid can be previously ascertained such total amount;  
 
(ii) where the sum is payable in perpetuity or for an indefinite time not 
terminable with any life in being at the date of such instrument or 
conveyance – the total amount which, according to the terms of such 
instrument or conveyance will or may be payable during the period of 
twenty years calculated from the date on which the first payment 
becomes due, and 
 
(iii) where the sum is payable for an indefinite time terminable with any life 
in being at the date of such instrument or conveyance – the maximum 
amount which will be or which may be payable as aforesaid during the 
period of 12 years calculated from the date on which the first payment 
becomes due.  
Clause (a) mentioned above applies where the sum is payable for a definite 
period, so that the total amount to be paid can be previously ascertained. According 
 
EP-GCL-5 
277 
to clause (b), where the payment is in perpetuity or for an indefinite period, then 
only the amount payable for 20 years would be taken for assessment of the duty.  
Illustration 
By a document, ‗A‘ binds himself and his posterity on the security of some 
immovable property for the annual payment to a temple of Rs. 2,200/-. It is a 
mortgage deed, chargeable with duty calculated on 20 years‘ payment.  
 (h) Section 26 deals with cases where the value of the subject matter is 
indeterminate. The object of this section is to protect the revenue, in cases 
where an instrument is chargeable with ad valorem duty, but such duty 
cannot be ascertained by reason of the fact that the amount of value of the 
subject matter of the instrument cannot be determined at the time of the 
execution of the instrument. This object is sought to be achieved by 
providing, that the executant can value the instrument as he pleases, but 
he shall not be entitled to recover under such document any amount in 
excess of the amount for which the stamp duty is sufficient.  
However, under the combined operation of Sections 26 and 35, a lessee under 
the mining lease is entitled, upon payment of the proper penalty, to recover the 
royalty provided for in the stamp originally affixed to the lease. [AIR 1924 PC 221; 
AIR 1930 Cal. 526]. Section 26 applies only when the instrument is chargeable with 
ad valorem duty. Section 26 has two provisos. Under the first proviso, in the case of 
mining lease, the stamp duty is to be calculated on the estimated value of the 
royalty or the share of the produce, as the case may be. If the lease is granted by 
the Government, stamp duty has to be paid on the amount or value of the royalty as 
determined by the Collector of Stamps. And, if subsequently any excess is claimed, 
proper penalty under section 35 may be paid and the claim fully recovered. But 
when the lease has been granted by a person other than the Government, the 
valuation has to be at Rs. 20,000/- a year.  
The second proviso to Section 26 is intended to cover the case where an 
instrument has, by accident or mistake, been insufficiently stamped. The deficiency 
is made up in proceedings under Section 31 or 41 and the Collector having certified 
the amount paid, it shall be deemed to be the stamp actually used at the date of 
execution. By reason of this proviso, the amount claimable under the instruments 
would be the amount for which the duty as certified by the Collector had been paid 
and not the amount for which duty was originally paid.  
10. CONSIDERATION TO BE SET OUT 
Section 27 provides that the consideration and all other facts and 
circumstances affecting the chargeability of any instrument with duty or the amount 
of duty with which it is chargeable shall be fully and truly set forth in the instrument. 
―Value of any property‖ would mean that real value of the property in the open 
market at the time the document was executed and not at the time when the 
executant acquired it. Where there is no value set forth in the instruments, there 
would be contravention of Section 27, but the omission does not render the 
document inadmissible or liable to be impounded and taxed in the manner provided 
in Section 35 (Vinayak v. Hasan Ali, AIR 1961 MP 6).  
EP-GCL-5 
278 
The Collector cannot proceed to ascertain the value of the 
property with a view to causing the instrument to be stamped 
with reference to the value so ascertained by the Collector. The 
Act does not provide for any powers to the revenue authority to 
make an independent enquiry into the value of the property conveyed for 
determining the duty chargeable. (AIR 1922 All 82) 
However, the Collector can direct the prosecution of a person who executed the 
instrument under Section 64 of the Act. Under Section 64, what is punishable is the 
omission to set-forth fully and truly the value of the property, with intent to defraud 
the Government. The Collector, can, if he feels that there is a deliberate under-
valuation of property, hold an independent enquiry to ascertain the true value of the 
property and to consider whether there was deliberate under-valuation rendering 
the executant liable to prosecution for defrauding the Government.1 
11. APPORTIONMENT 
Section 28 prescribes certain rules for apportionment of the consideration, in 
cases of certain conveyances arising out of a property being contracted to be sold 
and thereafter conveyed in parts etc. 
Under Section 28(1) where a person contracts the sale of property as a whole 
and thereafter conveys to the purchaser the property in separate parts, the 
consideration shall be apportioned in such manner as the parties think fit, provided 
that a distinct consideration is set-forth for each separate part in the conveyance 
and thereafter the conveyances shall be chargeable with ad valorem in respect of 
such distinct consideration.  
Under Section 28(2), where the contract is for the sale of a property as a whole 
to two or more purchasers jointly or by any person for himself and others, and the 
property is conveyed to them in parts by separate conveyance, then each distinct 
part of the consideration shall be chargeable with ad valorem duty in respect of the 
distinct part of the consideration so specified.  
Section 28(3) covers cases where a person, after contracting to purchase a 
property from another and before the property has been duly conveyed to him, 
enters into a contract to sell the property to a third person, and the contract is given 
effect to only by one conveyance from the owner of the property to the sub-
purchaser directly. The stamp duty payable is on the consideration paid by the sub-
purchaser. This provision avoids double payment that would otherwise arise.  
Section 28(4) provides that where a person contracts for the sale of property 
and before obtaining a conveyance in his favour, enters into a contract to sell the 
property in parts to other persons, the conveyances which may be executed directly 
by the owner to each sub-purchaser would be liable to be charged with duty in 
respect of the consideration paid by the sub-purchaser, original price for the whole 
and the aggregate price paid by the sub-purchasers, subject to a minimum duty of 
Re. 1/-. 
Section 28(5) provides that when a person contracts to sell a property to 
                                                     
1. In some States, local amendments have given such powers to the collector. 
 
EP-GCL-5 
279 
another person and again contracts to sell the same property to a third person and 
such third person obtains a conveyance first from the seller with whom he had 
contracted and later gets another conveyance of the same property from original 
seller, the duty is to be charged on the consideration received by the original seller 
subject to a maximum of Rs. 5/-. 
12. PERSONS LIABLE TO PAY DUTY

section, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, the expense of providing

 (b) in the case of a policy of insurance other than fire insurance by the person 
effecting the insurance; 
 (c) in the case of a policy of fire-insurance – by the person issuing the policy; 
 (d) in the case of a conveyance including a reconveyance of mortgaged 
property by the grantee; in the case of a lease or agreement to lease by the 
lessee or intended lessee; 
EP-GCL-5 
280 
 (e) in the case of a counterpart of a lease – by the lessor; 
 
(f) in the case of an instrument of exchange – by the parties in equal shares; 
 (g) in the case of a certificate of sale – by the purchaser of the property to 
which such certificate relates; and 
 (h) in the case of an instrument of partition – by the parties thereto in 
proportion to their respective shares in the whole property partitioned, or, 
when the partition is made in execution of an order passed by a Revenue 
Authority or Civil Court or arbitrator, in such proportion as such authority, 
Court or arbitrator directs.  
13. RECEIPTS 
Under Section 30 of the Act any person receiving any money exceeding twenty 
rupees in amount or any bill of exchange, cheque or promissory note for an amount 
exceeding five hundred rupees or receiving in satisfaction of a debt any movable 
property exceeding five hundred rupees in value, shall on demand by the person 
paying or delivering such money, bill, cheque, note, or property, give a duly 
stamped receipt for the same.  
14. PARTY LIABLE TO PAY 
Section 29 specifies in the case of certain instruments which party should pay, 
for the stamp. The section is not exhaustive and makes no reference to several 
instruments. Section 30 contains a special provision as to stamping of receipts. 
There are several other instruments not mentioned in Section 29, for which there is 
no express provision as to who should bear the stamp expenses. The primary duty 
of stamping lies in all cases on the person executing the instrument as Section 17 
directs that the instruments chargeable with duty shall be stamped at or before 
executing an instrument without the same being duly stamped. Section 29 would 
apply only in the absence of a special agreement between the parties as stated in 
the opening words of the section. An agreement to bear the cost of preparation of 
an instrument implies an agreement to pay stamp duty also on it.  
Any person receiving or taking credit for any premium or consideration for any 
renewal of any contract of fire-insurance, shall, within one month after receiving or 
taking credit for such premium or consideration, give a duly stamped receipt for the 
same.  
15. METHODS OF STAMPING 
 (a) According to the provisions of the Act and rules made thereunder, the duty 
with which an instrument is chargeable is to be paid by means of stamps 
indicated in the Act and the rules. Generally, rules deal with the subject.  
Section 10 provides that all duties with which any instrument is chargeable shall 
be paid, and such payment shall be indicated on such instrument, by means of 
stamps according to the provisions contained in the Act, or when no such provision 
is applicable thereto, as the State Government concerned may by rule, direct. The 
rules may, among other matters, regulate: 
 
(i) in the case of each kind of instrument, the description of stamps which may 
be used; 
 
EP-GCL-5 
281 
 (ii) in the case of instruments stamped with impressed stamps, the number of 
stamps which may be used; 
 (iii) in the case of bills of exchange or promissory notes, the size of the paper 
on which they are written. 
 (b) There are two types of stamping, namely: 
 
(i) Adhesive stamping, and 
 
(ii) Impressed stamping. 
16. USE OF ADHESIVE STAMPS 
Section 11 deals with the use of adhesive stamps. This Section provides that 
the following instruments may be stamped with adhesive stamps, namely – 
 (a) instruments chargeable with a duty not exceeding 10 naya paisa except 
parts of bills of exchange payable otherwise than on demand and drawn in 
sets; 
 (b) bills of exchange and promissory notes drawn or made out of India; 
 (c) entry as an advocate, vakil or attorney on the roll of a High Court; 
 (d) notarial acts; and 
 (e) transfers by endorsement of shares in any incorporated company or other 
body corporate.  
The use of the words ‗may be stamped‘ really connotes ‗shall be stamped‘. The 
rules framed under the Stamp Act as well as under the relevant state laws 
invariably provide that the adhesive stamps shall carry special words, to indicate 
the use to which the stamps can be put.  
17. CANCELLATION OF ADHESIVE STAMPS 
Section 12(1)(a) provides that any person affixing any adhesive stamp to any 
instrument chargeable with duty which has been executed by another person shall, 
when affixing such stamp cancel the same so that it cannot be used again. Under 
Sub-section (1)(b), an obligation has been imposed on person executing any 
instrument on any paper bearing an adhesive stamp, to cancel the stamp, if such 
cancellation has not been done, at the time of such execution. If a person fails to 
cancel the stamp, he becomes liable to penalty in accordance with Section 63. The 
object is to prevent the same stamp from being used again.  
Under Sub-section (2) of Section 12, any instrument bearing an adhesive stamp 
which has not been cancelled is deemed to be unstamped.  
18. MODE OF CANCELLATION OF ADHESIVE STAMPS 
 (a) Section 12(3) deals with the mode of cancellation of stamp. It provides that 
the cancellation of an adhesive stamp may be done by the person 
concerned by writing on or across the stamp his name or initials, or the 
name or initials of his firm with the true date of his so writing, or in any other 
effectual manner. Sub-section (3) merely lays down as a guidance one of 
the ways in which an adhesive stamp can be cancelled. 
EP-GCL-5 
282 
 (b) In Mahadeo Koeri v. Sheoraj Ram Teli, ILR 41 All 169; AIR 1919 All 196, it 
was held that a stamp may be treated as having been effectively cancelled 
by merely drawing a line across it.  
But, in Hafiz Allah Baksh v. Dost Mohammed, AIR 1935 Lah. 716, it was 
held that if it is possible to use a stamp a second time, in spite of a line being 
drawn across it, there is no effectual cancellation. Again, the question 
whether an adhesive stamp has been cancelled in an effectual manner has to 
be determined with reference to the facts and circumstances of each case.  
In Melaram v. Brij Lal, AIR 1920 Lah. 374, it was held that a very effective 
method of cancellation is the drawing of diagonal lines right across the stamps with 
ends extending on to the paper of the document. A cross marked by an illiterate 
person indicating his acknowledgement, was held to be an effective cancellation of 
the stamp in Kolai Sai v. Balai Hajam, AIR 1925 Rang. 209. Accordingly, where the 
adhesive stamps on promissory note were cancelled by drawing lines on them in 
different directions and stretching beyond the edge of the stamp on the paper on 
which the promissory note was written, it was held that the stamp had been 
effectually cancelled. Where one of the four stamps used on an instrument had a 
single line drawn across the face of the stamp, the second had two parallel lines, 
the third three parallel lines and the fourth two lines crossing each other, it was held 
that the stamps must be regarded as having been cancelled in manner so that they 
could not be used again (In re Tata Iron Steel Company, AIR 1928 Bom. 80). 
Putting two lines crossing each other is effective (AIR 1961 Raj. 43). 
 (c) However, putting a date across the stamp by a third party on a date 
subsequent to the date on which the bill had been drawn, was held to be 
not proper cancellation in Daya Ram v. Chandu Lal, AIR 1925 Bom. 520 Cf. 
Rohini v. Fernandes, AIR 1956 Bom. 421, 423. Similarly, crossing by 
drawing lines and signing on the adjacent stamp was held to be not a 
cancellation of the first stamp in U. Kyaw v. Hari Dutt, AIR 1934 Rang. 364. 
Cross is a good way of cancellation. AIR 1976 Cal. 99. 
 (d) Where it is alleged that the cancellation was made at later stage than that 
of execution, the burden of proving it, lies on the party who so alleges. 
Where an instrument prima facie appears to be duly stamped and cancelled 
by the drawer at the date of execution, the burden of proving the contrary 
lies on the party who avers that the cancellation was not effected at the 
time of execution. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it may be 
inferred that the stamp was duly affixed and cancelled.  
19. INSTRUMENTS STAMPED WITH IMPRESSED STAMPS HOW TO BE 
WRITTEN (WRITING ON STAMP PAPER) 
 (a) Section 13 provides that every instrument written upon paper stamped with 
an impressed stamp shall be written in such manner that the stamp may 
appear on the face of the instrument and cannot be used for or applied to 
any other instrument. The expression, ‗face of the instrument‘ is not to be 
interpreted as meaning that the document must commence on the side on 
which the stamp is impressed or that both sides of the paper or parchment 
may not be written upon. In Dowlat Ram Harji v. Vitho Radhoji, 5 Bom. 188, 
it was held when the face of a deed or document is mentioned, no 
 
EP-GCL-5 
283 
particular side of the parchment or paper, on which the deed or document is 
written, is thereby indicated. Even the last line may constitute the face 
(Westroph, CJ.). 
 (b) Under Section 14, no second instrument chargeable with duty shall be 
written upon piece of stamp paper upon which an instrument chargeable 
with duty has already been written. However, this section shall not prevent 
any endorsement which is duly stamped or is not chargeable with duty, 
being made upon any instrument for the purpose of transferring any right 
created or evidenced thereby, or of getting the receipt of any money or 
goods the payment or delivery of which, is secured thereby. 
 (c) The object of Section 14 is to prevent a stamped paper which has been 
used for one instrument, from being used for another instrument thereby 
avoiding payment of duty in respect of second instrument, AIR 1928 Rang 
262. Except for an endorsement of the kind referred to earlier, no second 
instrument shall be engrossed on a stamp paper on which there is already 
written ‗an instrument chargeable with duty‘. 
An alteration in the instrument as originally written, if it is of such nature, as to 
require fresh stamp, would come within the prohibition contained in the section. It is 
an important question as to what would be a material alteration1 which converts an 
instrument written on stamp paper into a second instrument within the meaning of 
Section 14. A ―material alteration‖ is one which alters (or purports to alter), the 
character of the instrument itself and which affects (or may affect) the contract 
which the instrument contains or alters evidence of any charge, or varies the 
liability under the instrument in any way. An alteration which vitiates the instrument 
as could cause it to operate differently was also held to be a material alteration. An 
alteration which may affect the contract which the instrument contains is a material 
alteration. 
Section 15 of the Act deems every instrument written in contravention of 
Section 13 or Section 14 to be unstamped and to be inadmissible in evidence as 
not being duly stamped. 
20. DENOTING DUTY 
Section 16 of the Act deals with denoting duty. The object of this section is to 
spare parties to an instrument, the inconvenience of having to produce (in cases in 
which the duty payable on an instrument depends upon the duty already paid on 
another instrument), the original or principal instrument in order to prove that the 
second instrument has been duly stamped. Section 16 provides that where the duty 
with which an instrument is chargeable, or its exemption from duty, depends in any 
manner upon the duty actually paid in respect of another instrument, the payment 
of such last mentioned duty, shall, if application is made in writing to the Collector 
for that purpose,  and  on  production  of  both  the instruments, be denoted upon 
such first mentioned instrument,  by  endorsement under the hand of the Collector 
of Stamps or in such other manner as the rules of the State Government may 
provide.

21. TIME OF STAMPING INSTRUMENTS 
 (a) Instruments executed inside India: Section 17 provides that all instruments 
chargeable with duty and executed by any person in India shall be stamped 
before or at the time of execution. The scope of Section 17 is restricted to 
only instruments executed in India. If the executant of a document has 
already completed the execution of the document and in the eye of law the 
document, could be said to have been executed, a subsequent stamping, 
(however close in time) could not render the document as one stamped at 
the time of execution. Thus, where a promissory note is executed by ‗A‘ and 
‗B‘ and a stamp is afterwards affixed and cancelled by ‗A‘ by again signing 
it, the stamping has taken place subsequent to the execution and hence, 
the provisions of Section 17 are not complied with (Rohini v. Fernandes, 
AIR 1956 Bom 421). A receipt stamped subsequent to its execution, but 
before being produced in the Court is not stamped in time and accordingly, 
not admissible in evidence.  
 (b) Instruments executed outside India: Section 18 relates to foreign 
instruments (other than bills and notes), received in India; Foreign bills and 
notes received in India have been dealt with, in Section 19. According to 
Section 18, every instrument chargeable with duty executed only out of 
India and (not being a bill of exchange or promissory note) may be stamped 
within three months after it has been first received in India. Section 18(2) 
provides that where such instrument cannot with reference to the 
description of stamp prescribed therefor, be duly stamped by a private 
person, it may be taken within the said period of three months to the 
Collector who shall stamp the same in such a manner as the State 
Government may by rule prescribe, with a stamp of that value as the 
person so taking such instrument may require and pay for. Where an 
instrument is brought to the Collector after the expiry of three months, the 
Collector may, instead of declining to stamp it, validate it under Sections 41 
and 42 if he is satisfied that the omission to stamp in time was due to a 
reasonable cause. 
The object of Section 18 is to facilitate the stamping of the documents within 
a period of three months, in as much as, by the very nature 
of things, Section 17 relating to instruments executed in 
India cannot be complied with. Section 18 is intended to 
mitigate the inconvenience and hardship that will entail if 
the instrument concerned is required to be stamped before 
or at the time of execution as laid down in Section 17. 
Instrument executed in India is not within Section 18 (Nath 
Bank v. Andhar Mamik Tea Co., AIR 1960 Cal 779).  
As far as bills of exchange and promissory notes are concerned, Section 19 
makes an elaborate provision. Any bill of exchange payable otherwise than on 
demand or promissory note drawn or made out of India must be stamped and the 
stamp cancelled, before the first holder in India deals with the instrument, i.e., 
presents the same for acceptance or payment, or endorses transfers or otherwise 
negotiates the same in India. 
 
EP-GCL-5 
285 
The proviso to Section 19 clarifies that if, (i) at any time any bill of exchange or 
note comes into the hands of any holder thereof in India, (ii) the proper adhesive 
stamp is affixed thereto and cancelled in the manner prescribed by Section 12 and 
(iii) such holder has no reason to believe that such stamp was affixed or cancelled 
otherwise than by the person, and at the time required by the Act, then such stamp 
shall (so far as relates to such holder), be deemed to have been duly affixed and 
cancelled. However, nothing contained in the proviso shall relieve any person from 
any penalty incurred by him, for omitting to affix or cancel a stamp. 
22. ADJUDICATION AS TO STAMPS 
 (a) Chapter III, consisting of Sections 31 and 32, deals with adjudication by the 
Collector, as to the proper stamp that an instrument has to bear. The 
provisions of this Chapter are intended to assist any party who is in doubt 
as to the proper stamp to be affixed on an instrument but is nevertheless 
anxious to stamp the instrument. When the document or any draft of the 
document is produced to the Collector he shall determine the proper stamp 
duty on payment of a nominal fee. The relevant provisions of the Act and 
matters in regard to the performance of this function by the Collector are 
discussed below. 
 (b) Under Section 31(1) when (i) an instrument, (whether executed or not and 
whether previously stamped or not), is brought to the Collector, and (ii) the 
person bringing it applies to have the opinion of that officer as to the duty if 
any, with which it is chargeable, and (iii) pays a fee (not exceeding Rs. 5 
and not less than 50 naya paise as the Collector may direct), the Collector 
shall determine the duty if any with which in his judgment, the instrument is 
chargeable. Under Section 31 (2), the Collector may require to be furnished 
with an abstract of the instrument and also with such affidavit or other 
evidence as he may deem necessary to prove that all the facts and 
circumstances affecting the chargeability of the instrument with duty, or the 
amount of duty with which it is chargeable, are fully and truly set-forth 
therein, and may refuse to proceed upon accordingly. However, no 
evidence furnished pursuant to this section shall be used against any 
person in any civil proceeding, except in an enquiry as to the duty with 
which the instrument to which it relates is chargeable. Every person by 
whom such evidence is furnished shall, on payment of the full duty, be 
relieved from any penalty which he may have incurred under the Act by 
reason of the omission to state truly in such instrument any of the facts or 
circumstances. 
 (c) The duty of the Collector under Section 31 is only to determine the stamp 
duty payable upon the instrument. He is not authorised to impound the 
instrument or to impose any penalty if he comes to the conclusion that the 
instrument is not sufficiently stamped. Where a person has obtained the 
opinion of the Collector on any draft instrument, and thereafter does not 
want to proceed any further to execute the instrument, no consequences 
will follow and, after determination of the duty, the Collector becomes 
functus officio. But where the party wants to proceed with effectuating the 
instrument or using it for the purposes of evidence, he has to pay the duty 
determined by the Collector and obtain from the Collector under Section 32, 
an endorsement that the full duty with which the instrument is chargeable 
EP-GCL-5 
286 
has been paid. Normally, the determination by the Collector of the duty 
payable on an instrument under Section 31 is final. 
 (d) Section 32 deals with certificate by the Collector of Stamps as well as the 
time limit within which such a certificate can be given by the Collector of 
Stamps. Sub-section (1) of the section provides that when an instrument is 
brought to the Collector with an application for having an opinion as to the 
proper duty chargeable thereon, and the Collector is of the opinion that the 
instrument is already fully stamped or the duty determined by the Collector 
under Section 31 or such a sum as (with the duty already paid in respect of 
the instrument), is equal to the duty so determined, has been paid, the 
Collector shall certify by endorsement on such instrument, that the full duty 
(stating the amount) with which it is chargeable has been paid. When the 
Collector is of opinion that any such instrument brought to him is not 
chargeable with duty, he shall certify in the same manner that such 
instrument is not so chargeable. Under Section 32(3), any instrument upon 
which an endorsement has been made by the Collector shall be deemed to 
be duly stamped or not chargeable with duty as the case may be, and if 
chargeable with duty, shall be receivable in evidence or otherwise and may 
be acted upon and registered as if it had been originally duly stamped. 
The proviso to Section 32(3) categorically provides that the Collector shall not 
make any endorsement on any instrument under Section 32, where –  
 (a) any instrument is executed or first executed in India and brought to him 
after the expiration of one month from the date of its execution or first 
execution, as the case may be; 
 (b) any instrument is executed or first executed out of India and brought to him 
after the expiration of three months after it has been first received in India; 
or 
 (c) any instrument chargeable with a duty not exceeding 10 naya paise or any 
bill of exchange or promissory note, is brought to him after the drawing or 
execution thereof, on paper not duly stamped. 
In effect, the proviso to Section 32(3) lays down the time limit within which the 
Collector of Stamps can make any endorsement on any instrument brought to him, 
for his opinion as to the duty chargeable thereon. 
23. INSTRUMENTS 
NOT 
DULY 
STAMPED 
– 
TREATMENT 
AND 
CONSEQUENCES (IMPOUNDING) 
 (a) The definition of the term ―duly stamped‖ has already been explained. 
Chapter IV of the Act (consisting of Sections 35 to 48) provides for the 
consequences that follow where instruments are not duly stamped. 
 
 Section 33 contains a mandate on certain officials to impound an 
instrument which is not duly stamped. Section 33(1) provides that every 
person having by law or consent of parties, authority to receive evidence 
and every person in charge of a public office, except an officer of police 
before whom any instrument, chargeable in his opinion, with duty is 
produced or comes in the performance of his functions, shall, if it appears 
to him that the instrument is not duly stamped, impound the same. The 
object of this Section is to protect the revenue, and the Court or public 
 
EP-GCL-5 
287 
? 
officer authorised by this Section must, exercise the powers under the 
Section suo moto and the jurisdiction of the Court does not depend upon 
raising of an objection by the parties. For the purposes of this section, the 
State Government may determine what offices are public offices. The 
Section also provides that the instrument must be impounded, before it can 
be admitted in evidence. Once it is admitted in evidence, the instrument 
cannot be impounded at a later stage and a court, after it becomes functus 
officio, cannot rectify an earlier error. 
 (b) The word „produced‟ has to be properly understood. It means 
produced in response to a summon or produced voluntarily for some 
judicial purpose, such as, for supporting an evidence. It does not refer 
to a document which accidentally or incidentally falls into a judge‟s 
hand. The Court is not justified in impounding a document which the 
witness had not been called upon to produce (Narayandas v. 
Nathuram, ILR 1943 Nag. 520; AIR 1943 Nag. 97). Similarly, a Court 
before which a copy of a document has been produced cannot compel 
the party to produce the original document with a view to impounding 
it, having received information that is not sufficiently stamped. It is 
open to the party to refuse to obey the order of the Court in this 
respect (Uttam Chand v. Permanand, AIR 1942 Lah. 265). 
 (c) Where a magistrate issued a warrant with a view to discovering registers 
kept by the accused containing documents not stamped in accordance with 
the provisions of the Stamp Act, and in course of the search, the registers 
were seized and produced before the magistrate, it was held that the 
documents thus produced could be impounded as the word ‗comes‘ is 
sufficiently wide to include documents produced by the search under a 
search warrant (Emperor v. Balu Kuppayyan, ILR 25 Mad. 525). This case 
should be confined to its facts.  
 (d) An arbitrator has the consent of parties to adjudicate the issues coming 
before him and where the parties tender evidence, an arbitrator has a 
statutory duty under Section 33(1) to check whether the instrument so 
produced is duly stamped and if not, to impound the same.  
 (e) However, this shall not compel any magistrate or judge of a Criminal Court 
to examine or impound (if he does not think it fit to do so) any instrument 
coming before him in the course of any proceeding other than possession 
proceedings and maintenance proceedings. Also, a judge of a High Court 
can delegate the duty of examining and impounding any instrument to any 
other person appointed by the court in this behalf.

24. UNSTAMPED RECEIPTS 
Section 34 provides that where the instrument is an unstamped receipt 
produced in the course of an audit of any public account, the officer before whom 
the receipt is produced has a discretion either to impound or to require the receipt 
to be stamped. This section applies where the receipt is chargeable with a duty not 
exceeding 10 naya paisa. The officer concerned can, instead of impounding the 
receipt require a duly stamped receipt to be substituted therefor.  
25. INSTRUMENTS NOT DULY STAMPED INADMISSIBLE IN EVIDENCE 
 (a) Section 35 stipulates that no instrument chargeable with duty shall be– 
 
(i) admitted in evidence for any purpose whatsoever by any person 
authorised by law (such as judges or commissioners) or by the consent 
of the parties (such as arbitrators) to record evidence; or  
 
(ii) shall be acted upon; or 
 
(iii) registered; or 
 
(iv) authenticated by any such person as aforesaid or by any public officer. 
 
 unless such instrument is duly stamped.  
 
 An insufficiently stamped instrument is not an invalid document and it can 
be admitted in evidence on payment of penalty.  
 
 [See K. Narasimha Rao v. Sai Vishnu, AIR 2006 AP 80 also at p.302] 
 
 Photocopy of an agreement not being an ‗instrument‘ such copy of 
document which is unstamped can not be validated by payment of stamp 
duty and penalty. Ashok Kalam Capital Builders v. State & Anr., AIR 2010 
(NOC) 736 (Del). 
 (b) The proviso to Section 35 provides as under: 
 
(i) any instrument not being an instrument chargeable with a duty not 
exceeding 10 naya paisa only, or a bill of exchange, or promissory 
note, subject to all such expectations, be admitted in evidence on 
payment of the duty with which the same is chargeable, or, in the case 
of an instrument insufficiently stamped, of the amount required to make 
up such duty, together with a penalty of Rs. 5/- or when ten times the 
amount of the proper duty or deficient portion thereof exceeds Rs. 5/-, 
on a sum equal to ten times such duty or portion; 
 
(ii) where any person from whom a stamped receipt could have been 
demanded has given an unstamped receipt and such receipt, if 
stamped, would be admissible in evidence against him, on payment of 
a penalty of Re. 1/- by the person tendering it;  
 
(iii) where a contract or agreement of any kind is affected by the 
correspondence consisting of two or more letters and any one of the 
letters bears the proper stamp, the contract or agreement shall be 
deemed to be duly stamped;  
 
(iv) nothing contained in Section 35 shall prevent the admission of any 
instrument in evidence in any proceeding in a criminal Court other than 
 
EP-GCL-5 
289 
the proceeding under Chapter XII or Chapter XXXVI of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898;  
 
(v) also nothing contained in Section 35 shall prevent the admission of any 
instrument in the Court, when such instrument has been executed by or 
on behalf of the Government, or where it bears the certificate of the 
Collector as provided by Section 32 or any other provision of the Act.  
 (c) The words ‗shall not be admissible in evidence‘ used in this Section only 
means that the document shall not be made the basis of the decision or 
should not be relied upon to support any finding (Sheonath Prasad v. 
Sorjoo Nonia, 1943 ALJ, 189; AIR 1943 All 220 (FB)). There is no embargo 
upon proving the surrounding circumstances.  
 (d) The words ‗for any purpose‘ used in this Section would have their natural 
meaning. Where an unstamped document is admitted in proof of some 
collateral matter, it is certainly admitted in evidence for that purpose, which 
the Act prohibits. In Ram Ratan v. Parmanand, ILR 1946 Lah. 63, it was 
held that an unstamped partition deed cannot be used to corroborate the 
oral evidence for the purpose of determining even the factum of partition as 
distinct from its term. The words ‗for any purpose‘ would in effect mean ‗for 
each and every purpose whatsoever without any exception‘.  
 (e) It is immaterial whether the purpose is the main purpose or a collateral one. 
The words ‗acted on‘ means that nothing can be recovered under the 
instrument unless it has a proper stamp. Similarly, where a suit is brought 
upon an instrument which is not duly stamped, the admission of the 
contents of the instrument made by the defendant does not avail the 
claimant and a decree cannot be based on such instruments. Admitting an 
instrument in evidence also amounts to acting upon it and an instrument 
which should have been stamped but is not stamped is not admissible in 
evidence for any purpose whatsoever.  
 
(f) Where an unstamped instrument is lost, the party relying on it is helpless 
and no payment of penalty can enable admission of secondary evidence.  
26. ADMISSION OF INSTRUMENTS (WHERE NOT TO BE QUESTIONED) 
Section 36 provides that where an instrument has been 
admitted in evidence, such an admission shall not (except as 
provided in Section 61) be called in question at any stage of the 
same suit or proceeding on the ground that the instrument has 
not been duly stamped. Section 36 is mandatory (Guni Ram v. Kodar, AIR 
1971 All 434, 437). 
If notwithstanding any objection, the trial Court admits the document, the 
matter ends there and the Court cannot subsequently order the deficiency to 
be made and levy penalty (Bhupathi Nath v. Basanta Kumar, AIR 1936 Cal. 
556; AIR 1933 Lah. 240). 
However, it should be mentioned that Section 61 makes certain important 
provisions, details of which will be discussed later.  
EP-GCL-5

27. ADMISSION OF IMPROPERLY STAMPED INSTRUMENTS 
Under Section 37, opportunity is given to a party, of getting a mistake rectified 
when a stamp of proper amount, but of improper description has been used. Under 
this section, the State Government may make rules providing that, where an 
instrument bears a stamp of sufficient amount but of improper description, the 
instrument may, on payment of the duty with which the stamp is chargeable, be 
certified to be duly stamped, and any instrument so certified shall then be deemed 
to have been duly stamped as from the date of its execution.  
28. DEALING WITH INSTRUMENTS IMPOUNDED 
 (a) Section 38 deals with instruments impounded under Section 33. A person 
impounding an instrument under Section 33 and receiving the same in 
evidence (upon payment of penalty under Section 35 or, of duty under 
Section 37) shall send, to the Collector of Stamps, an authenticated copy of 
such instrument, together with a certificate in writing, stating the amount of 
duty and penalty levied in respect thereof and shall send such amount to 
the Collector or to such person as the Collector may appoint in this behalf. 
In every other case, the person so impounding an instrument shall send it 
in original to the Collector.  
 (b) Section 39 vests the Collector with certain powers to refund penalty 
recovered by a court on impounding a document not duly stamped when 
produced before it. Under Section 38, the court so impounding the 
instrument and realising the penalty has to forward an authenticated copy 
of the instrument and the amount of penalty recovered to the Collector. The 
Collector, on examining the instrument so received by him may, in his 
discretion, refund the whole penalty if it had been imposed for 
contravention of Section 13 or Section 14 of the Act and in any other case 
any portion of the penalty in excess of Rs. 5/- in cases where a copy of the 
instrument under Section 38(1) has been sent to him. The Collector can act 
suo motu without any application in this behalf being made by a party 
affected.  
29. COLLECTOR‟S POWER TO STAMP INSTRUMENT IMPOUNDED 
Section 40 deals with Collector‘s powers to stamp an instrument which is 
impounded. Under Section 40(1), the Collector when impounding any instrument 
under Section 33, or receiving any instrument under Section 38(2) not being an 
instrument chargeable with duty not exceeding 10 naya paisa only or a bill of 
exchange or promissory note, shall adopt the following procedure: 
 
(i) if he is of the opinion that instrument is duly stamped or is not chargeable 
with duty, he shall certify by endorsement thereon that it is duly stamped, or 
that it is not so chargeable as the case may be;  
 (ii) if he is of the opinion that such instrument, is chargeable with duty and is 
not duly stamped, he shall require the payment of the proper duty or the 
amount required to make up the same, together with a penalty of Rs. 5/-, if 
he thinks fit an amount not exceeding ten times the amount of the proper 
duty or of the deficient portion thereof, whether such amount exceeds or 
falls short of Rs. 5/-.  
 
EP-GCL-5 
291 
? 
The Collector, however, has the discretion to remit the whole penalty leviable 
under this Section in a case where the instrument has been impounded only 
because it has been written in contravention of Section 13 or Section 14. 
A certificate given in the situation (i) above, shall, for the purposes of the Act be 
conclusive evidence of the matters stated therein. Sub-section (3) of Section 40 
provides that an instrument which has been sent to the Collector under Section 
38(2) shall be returned to the impounding officer after the collector has dealt with 
the same in the manner provided above.

Who can receive the stamp duty without penalty and certify an instrument as duly 
stamped, as from the date of execution? 
 (a) Revenue Officer 
 (b) Magistrate 
 (c) Collector 
 (d) None of the above 
Correct answer: (c) 
 
30. INSTRUMENTS UNDULY STAMPED BY ACCIDENT 
Section 41 deals with cases where a person, of his own motion bring it to the 
Collector‘s notice that the instrument is not duly stamped. In such cases, if the 
Collector is satisfied, that the omission to pay the proper duty was due to accident, 
mistake or urgent necessity, he may receive the deficit amount and certify by 
endorsement on the instrument that the proper duty has been levied. In order to 
avail of the benefit of this section, the instrument must be produced before the 
Collector within one year of the date of its execution. Where the instrument is 
brought to the notice of the Collector, beyond the period of one year, Section 47 
has no application and the Collector has to proceed under Section 42 read with 
Section 33 and 40 of the Act. Where the instrument having been brought to the 
notice of the Collector within the period of one year, the Collector is in doubt 
regarding the amount of duty chargeable, he may refer the case to the Chief 
Controlling Revenue Authority and proceed in accordance with the decision of such 
authority. However, where no such reference is made by the Collector, the 
Collector‘s decision would be final, and the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority 
cannot interfere with his decision.  
31. ENDORSEMENT OF INSTRUMENT ON WHICH DUTY HAS BEEN PAID 
UNDER SECTIONS 35, 40 AND 41 
Section 42 deals with cases where duty and penalty, if any, have been levied 
and realised by the court or any other body or by the Collector. In such cases, the 
authority refunding and collecting the duty and penalty must make an endorsement 
on the instrument as to the amount paid and the name and the residence of the 
EP-GCL-5 
292 
person paying the same. Upon such certification, the instrument becomes 
admissible in evidence and may be registered and acted upon as if it had been duly 
stamped. The duty and penalty referred to in this Section are those covered by 
Sections 35, 40 or 41 as the case may be. The proviso to this Section lays down 
that no instrument which has been admitted in evidence upon payment of duty and 
a penalty under Section 35, shall be delivered to the person from whom possession 
of it came into the hands of the officer impounding it, before the expiration of one 
month from the date of such impounding or if the Collector has certified that its 
further detention is necessary and has not cancelled such certificate. Again, 
nothing contained in Section 42 shall affect the provisions of clause (3) of Section 
144 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1889 [under the present Code the 
corresponding provision is proviso to Order 13, Rule 9(1)]. 
32. PROSECUTION FOR OFFENCES AGAINST STAMP LAW 
Section 43 deals with prosecutions for offences against the Stamp Law. This 
section provides that a levy of a penalty or payment thereof in respect of an 
unstamped or insufficiently stamped document (as provided for in Chapter IV) does 
not necessarily exempt a person from liability for prosecution for such offence. 
However, the proviso to the section clarifies that no such prosecution shall be 
instituted in the case of any instrument in respect of which a penalty has been paid, 
unless it appears to the Collector that the offence was committed with the intention 
of evading the payment of proper duty. On receipt of copy of the instrument 
impounded under Section 38, the Collector can initiate criminal proceedings if he 
sees reasons therefor.  
33. RECOVERY OF DUTY OR PENALTY IN CERTAIN CASES 
Section 44 deals with the circumstances in which persons paying duty or 
penalty may recover the same in certain cases. The duty or penalty under this 
Section refers to the duty or penalty paid/levied under Sections 35, 37, 40 or 41 of 
the Act. It also includes any duty or penalty under Section 29. The remedy is 
available to a person who, under the Act, was not bound to bear the expense of 
providing the proper stamp for such instrument. Such a person shall be entitled to 
recover, from the person bound to bear such expense, the amount of duty or 
penalty, if any, paid. For the purpose of such recovery, any certificate granted in 
respect of such instruments under the Act shall be conclusive evidence of the 
matters therein certified. Sub-section (3) of Section 44 further provides that the 
amounts so recoverable may, if the court thinks fit, be included in any order as to 
cost in any suit or proceedings to which such persons are parties and in which such 
instrument has been tendered in evidence. If the court does not include the amount 
in such order, no further proceedings for the recovery of the amount shall be 
maintainable.  
34. REFUND OF DUTY OR PENALTY IN CERTAIN CASES BY REVENUE 
AUTHORITY 
Section 45 deals with power of the Revenue Authority to refund the penalty in 
excess of duty payable on instrument in certain cases. Section 39 of the Act 
empowers the Collector to refund a part and in some cases, the whole of the 
penalty paid under the provisions of Section 35. Section 45 further empowers the 
Chief Controlling Revenue Authority to order refunds. The object of granting such 
 
EP-GCL-5 
293 
further power to the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority is evidently to set right 
mistakes or other omissions by the Collector to order refund in deserving cases. 
The Section provides that where any penalty is paid under Section 35 or Section 
40, the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority may, upon application in writing made 
within one year from the date of payment, order, refund such penalty wholly or in 
part. Where in the opinion of the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority, stamp duty in 
excess of that which is legally chargeable has been charged and paid under 
Section 35 or Section 40, such authority may, upon application in writing made 
within three months of the order charging the same, refund the excess.  
It is necessary to appreciate the differences between the powers of the 
Collector under Section 39 and the powers of the Controlling Revenue Authority 
under Section 45 at this stage. They are: 
 
(i) Section 39 provides for refund of penalty, whereas Section 45 confers 
powers to refund even duties where they have been paid in excess.  
 (ii) The Collector‘s power to refund penalty is restricted only to two cases 
mentioned in Section 39(3) but the powers under Section 45 are not subject 
to any such limitation.  
 (iii) Section 39 does not lay down any time limit for the Collector to exercise his 
powers to refund, but in the case of Section 45 there is a time limit.  
 (iv) The power under Section 45 is to be exercised only when an application is 
made by a party, whereas under Section 39 it is routine function of the 
Collector.  
The power under Section 45 is a purely discretionary one and the Chief 
Controlling Revenue Authority cannot be compelled to exercise his power by any 
further proceedings.  
35. NON-LIABILITY FOR LOSS OF INSTRUMENTS SENT UNDER SECTION 38 
Section 46 provides that where any instrument sent to the Collector under 
Section 38(2) is lost, destroyed during transmission, the person sending the same, 
shall not be liable for such loss, destruction or damage.  
However, Section 38(2) provides that when any instrument is to be sent, the 
person from whose possession it came into the hands of the person impounding 
the same may require a copy thereof to be made at his expense and authenticated 
by the person impounding such instruments.  
36. POWER TO STAMP IN CERTAIN CASES 
Under Section 47 when any bill exchange or promissory note chargeable with a 
duty not exceeding 10 naya paise is presented for payment unstamped, the person 
to whom it is so presented may affix thereto the necessary adhesive stamp, and, 
upon cancelling the same in the manner provided in the Act, may pay the sum 
payable upon such bill or note and may charge the duty against the person who 
ought to have paid the same, or deduct it from the sum payable as aforesaid and 
such bill or note shall, so far as respects the duty, be deemed good and valid. 
However, nothing contained in this section shall relieve any person from any 
penalty or proceeding to which he may be liable in relation to such bill or note.  
EP-GCL-5 
294 
37. RECOVERY OF DUTIES AND PENALTIES 
Under Section 48, all duties penalties and other sums required to be paid under 
this Chapter may be recovered by the Collector by distress and sale of the movable 
property of the person or by any other process used for the recovery of the arrears 
of land revenue. This section provides for the mode of realisation of duty or penalty 
or other sums not voluntarily paid.  
38. ALLOWANCE AND REFUND 
Section 49 deals with different circumstances in which refund would be 
admissible in respect of impressed stamps not used. The section applies only to 
impressed stamps and not adhesive stamps. Clause (a) of the section refers to 
cases where the stamp paper is spoiled before any document has been written 
thereon, or is spoiled in the course of writing and before execution. Clause (b) 
refers to cases where the document has been written out wholly or in part but not 
executed. Clause (c) refers to bills of exchange payable otherwise than on demand 
and promissory notes, when these have not been accepted or made use of. Clause 
(d) deals with refunds after execution.  
Section 49 provides that subject to such rule as may be made by the State 
Government, as to the evidence to be required, or the enquiry to be made, the 
Collector may, on application made within the period prescribed in Section 50, and 
if he is satisfied as to the facts, make allowance for impressed stamps spoiled in 
the cases hereinafter mentioned, namely: 
 (a) the stamp on any paper inadvertently and undesignedly spoiled, obliterated 
or by error in writing or any other means rendered unfit for the purpose 
intended before any instrument written thereon is executed by any person;  
 (b) the stamp on any document which is written out wholly or in part; but which 
is not signed or executed by any party thereto; 
 (c) in the case of bills of exchange payable otherwise than on demand or 
promissory notes: 
 
(1) the stamp on any such bill of exchange signed by or on behalf of the 
drawer which has not been accepted or made use of in any manner 
whatever or delivered out of his hands for any purpose other than by 
way of tender for acceptance provided that the paper on which any 
such stamp is impressed, does not bear any signature intended as or 
for the acceptance of any bill of exchange to be afterwards written 
thereon;  
 
(2) the stamp on any promissory note signed by or in behalf of the maker 
which has not been made use of in any manner whatever or delivered 
out of his hands; 
 
(3) the stamp used or intended to be used for any such bill of exchange or 
promissory note signed by, or on behalf of, the drawer thereof, but 
which from any omission or error has been spoiled or rendered useless, 
although the same, being a bill of exchange may have been presented 
for acceptance or accepted or endorsed, or being a promissory note 
may have been delivered to the payee: provided that another 
completed and duly stamped bill of exchange or promissory note is 
 
EP-GCL-5 
295 
produced identical in every particular, except in the correction of such 
omission or error as aforesaid, with the spoiled bill, or note; 
 (d) The stamp used for an instrument executed by any party thereto which–  
 
(1) has been afterwards found to be absolutely void in law from the 
beginning; 
 
(2) has been afterwards found unfit, by reason of any error or mistake 
therein, for purpose originally intended; 
 
(3) by reason of the death of any person by whom it is necessary that it 
should be executed, without having executed the same, or of the 
refusal of any such person to execute the same, cannot be completed 
so as to effect the intended transaction in the form proposed; 
 
(4) for want of the execution thereof by some material party, and his 
inability or refusal to sign the same, is in fact incomplete and insufficient 
for the purpose for which it was intended; 
 
(5) by reason of the refusal of any person to act under the same or to 
advance any money intended to be thereby secured or by the refusal or 
non-acceptance of any office thereby granted, totally fails of the 
intended purpose; 
 
(6) becomes useless in consequence of the transaction intended to be 
thereby effected being effected by some other instrument between the 
same parties and bearing a stamp of not less value; 
 
(7) is deficient in value and the transaction intended to be thereby effected 
has been effected by some other instrument between the same parties 
and bearing a stamp of not less value; 
 
(8) is inadvertently and undesignedly spoiled, and in lieu whereof another 
instrument made between the same parties and for the same purpose 
is executed and duly stamped.  
Provided that, in the case of an executed instrument, no legal proceeding has 
been commenced in which the instrument could or would have been given or 
offered in evidence and that the instrument is given up to be cancelled.  
39. TIME LIMITS 
Section 50 prescribes the time limit within which an application for relief in 
respect of impressed stamps spoiled, can be made; different time limits have been 
specified for the purpose, namely: 
 (1) in the cases mentioned in clause (d)(5) of Section 49, within two months of 
the date of the instrument; 
 (2) in the case of a stamped paper on which no instrument has been executed 
by any of the parties thereto, within six months after the stamp has been 
spoiled; 
 (3) in the case of a stamped paper in which an instrument has been executed 
by any of the parties thereto, within six months after the date of the 
instrument, or if it is not dated, within six months after the execution thereof 
by the person by whom it was first or alone executed: 
EP-GCL-5 
296 
Provided that – 
 (a) when the spoiled instrument has been for sufficient reasons sent out of 
India, the application may be made within six months after it has been 
received back in India.  
 (b) when, from unavoidable circumstances, any instrument for which another 
instrument has been substituted, cannot be given up to be cancelled within 
the aforesaid period, the application may be made within six months after 
the date of execution of the substituted instrument.  
40. UNUSED FORMS 
Section 51 of the Act enables the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority or the 
Collector if authorised by the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority, for such purpose 
to allow refunds in cases where refunds of stamps on printed forms used by 
bankers, incorporated companies/bodies corporate if required. Allowance may be 
made without limit of time, for stamped papers used for printed forms of instruments 
any bankers or by any incorporated company or other body corporate, if for any 
sufficient reasons such forms have ceased to be required by the said banker, 
company or body corporate: provided that the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority 
or the Collector, as the case may be, is satisfied that the duty in respect of such 
stamped papers has been duly paid.  
41. MISUSED STAMPS 
Section 52 deals with allowance for misused stamps and applies to both 
impressed and adhesive stamps in the following instances: 
 (a) When any person has inadvertently used, for an instrument chargeable with 
duty, a stamp of a description other than that prescribed for such 
instrument by the rules made under this Act, or a stamp of greater value 
than was necessary, or has inadvertently used any stamp for an instrument 
not chargeable with any duty; or 
 (b) When any stamp used for an instrument has been inadvertently rendered 
useless under Section 15, owing to such instrument having been written in 
contravention of the provisions of Section 13.  
The Collector may, on application made within six months after the date of 
instrument or, if it is not dated, within six months after the execution thereof by the 
person by whom it was first or alone executed, and upon the instrument, if 
chargeable with duty, being restamped with the proper duty, cancel and allow as 
spoiled the stamp so misused or rendered useless.  
Under Section 53, in any case in which allowance is made for spoiled or 
misused stamps, the Collector may give in lieu thereof: 
 (a) other stamps of the same description and value; or 
 (b) if required and he thinks fit, stamps of any other description to the same 
amount in value; or 
 (c) at his discretion, the same value in money, deducting ten naya paisa for 
each rupee or fraction of a rupee.  
 
EP-GCL-5 
297 
? 
Section 54 of the Act enables a person to obtain refund of the value of stamps 
purchased by him, if he has no immediate use thereof. Under this section, when 
any person is possessed of a stamp or stamps which have not been spoiled or 
rendered unfit or useless for the purpose intended, but for which he has no 
immediate use, the Collector shall repay to such person the value of such stamp or 
stamps in money, deducting ten naya paise for each rupee or portion of a rupee, 
upon such person delivering up the same to be cancelled and proving to the 
Collector‘s satisfaction 
 (a) that such stamp or stamps were purchased by such person with a bona fide 
intention to use them; and 
 (b) that he has paid the full price thereof; and  
 (c) that they were so purchased within the period of six months next preceding 
the date on which they were so delivered.  
Provided that, where the person is a licensed vendor of stamps, the Collector 
may, if he thinks fit, make the repayment of the sum actually paid by the vendor 
without any such deduction as aforesaid.

42. DEBENTURES 
Section 55 is intended to relieve companies renewing debentures issued by 
them from the liability to pay stamp duty on both the original and the renewed 
debenture. As per this section, when any duly stamped debenture is renewed by 
the issue of a new debenture in the same terms, the Collector shall, upon 
application made within one month, repay to the person issuing such debenture, 
the value of the stamp on the original or on the new debenture whichever shall be 
less: 
Provided that the original debenture is produced before the Collector and 
cancelled by him in such manner as the State Government may direct.  
A debenture shall be deemed to be renewed in the same terms within the 
meaning of this section notwithstanding the following changes: 
 (a) the issue of two or more debentures in place of one original debenture, the 
total amount secured being the same; 
 (b) the issue of one debenture in place of two or more original debentures, the 
total amount secured being the same;  
 (c) the substitution of the name of the holder at the time of renewal for the 
name of the original holder; and 
EP-GCL-5 
298 
 (d) the alteration of the rate of interest of the date of payment hereof.  
43. REFERENCE AND REVISION 
Sections 56 to 61 deal with Reference and Revision. Section 56 provides that 
the powers exercisable by a Collector under Chapter IV and V and under clause (a) 
of the first proviso to Section 26 shall in all cases be subject to the control of the 
Chief Controlling Revenue Authority. Further, if any Collector, acting under Sections 
31, 40 or 41, feels doubt as to the amount of duty with which any instrument is 
chargeable, he may draw up a statement of the case, and refer it, with his own 
opinion thereon, for the decision of the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority 
[Section 56(2)].  
Such authority shall consider the case and send a copy of its decision to the 
Collector, who shall proceed to assess and charge the duty (if any) in conformity 
with such decision.  
As per Section 57(1), the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority may state any 
case referred to it under Section 56(2) or otherwise coming to its notice, and refer 
such case, with its own opinion thereon to the High Court and the same shall be 
decided by not less than three Judges of the High Court and the majority decision 
shall prevail.  
According to Section 58, if the High Court is not satisfied that the statements 
contained in the case are sufficient to enable it to determine the questions raised 
thereby, the court may refer the case back to the Revenue Authority for further feed 
back. The High Court shall decide the questions raised and give its judgment to the 
Authority who shall dispose of the case as per the judgment.  
As per Section 60, any subordinate Court can also refer such case to the High 
Court like the Revenue Authority but should be through proper channel. In Section 
61(1) of the Act it is provided that a Court may take into consideration on its own 
motion or on application of the Collector, an order of the lower Court admitting the 
instrument as duly stamped or as not requiring stamp duty or on payment of duty 
and penalty. According to sub-section 2 of Section 61, if such Court is not in 
agreement with the stand of the lower Court, it may require that the instrument be 
produced before it and may even impound the same if necessary. While doing so, 
the Court shall send a copy of its order to the Collector and to the office/Court from 
which such instrument has been received. [Section 61(3)]  
44. PROSECUTION 
As per Section 61(4), the Collector has got the power notwithstanding anything 
contained in the order of the lower court, to prosecute a person if any offence 
against the Stamp Act which he considers that the person has committed in respect 
of such an instrument. The prosecution is instituted when he is satisfied that the 
offence is committed with an intention of evading the proper stamp duty. The order 
of the lower Court as to the instrument shall be valid except for the purposes of 
prosecution in this respect.  
45. CRIMINAL OFFENCES 
Sections 62 to 72 deal with penalties for offences. The provisions are as under: 
 (1) As per Section 62(1), any person  
 
EP-GCL-5 
299 
 
(a) drawing, making, issuing, endorsing or transferring, or signing 
otherwise than as a witness, or presenting for acceptance or payment, 
or accepting, paying or receiving payment of or in any manner 
negotiating, any bill of exchange (payable otherwise than on demand) 
or promissory note without the same being duly stamped; or 
 
(b) executing or signing otherwise than as a witness any other instrument 
chargeable with duty without the same being duly stamped; or 
 
(c) voting or attempting to vote under any proxy not duly stamped shall, for 
every such offence, be punishable with fine which may extend to five 
hundred rupees.  
Provided that, when any penalty has been paid in respect of any instrument 
under Sections 35, 40 or 61, the amount of such penalty shall be allowed in 
reduction of the fine (if any) subsequently imposed under this section in respect of 
the same instrument upon the person who paid such penalty. In such a case the 
Collector is to make an enquiry and to give an opportunity to the accused to pay. In 
such cases the instrument is (i) chargeable with duty, and (ii) there is a dishonest 
intention not to pay the duty.  
Sub-section (2) of Section 62, provides that if a share-warrant is issued without 
being duly stamped, the company issuing the same, and also every person who, at 
the time when it is issued, its managing director or secretary or other principal 
officer of the company, shall be punishable with fine which may extend to five 
hundred rupees.  
 (2) Any person required by Section 12 to cancel an adhesive stamp, and failing 
to cancel such stamp in the manner prescribed by that section, shall be 
punishable with fine which may extend to one hundred rupees (Section 63). 
The criminal intention is necessary for an offence under this Section.  
 (3) As per Section 64, any person who, with intent to defraud the Government- 
 
(a) executes any instrument in which all the facts and circumstances 
required by Section 27 to be set forth in such instrument are not fully 
and truly set forth; or  
 
(b) being employed or concerned in or about the preparation of any 
instrument, neglects or omits fully and truly to set forth therein all such 
facts and circumstances; or 
 
(c) does any other Act calculated to deprive the Government of any duty or 
penalty under this Act;  
 
 shall be punishable with fine which may extend to five thousand rupees.  
Here also, an intention to evade payment of proper stamp duty or intention to 
defraud the Government of its stamp revenue is necessary.  
 (4) Any person who (a) being required under Section 30 to give a receipt, 
refuses or neglects to give the same; or (b) with intent to defraud the 
Government of any duty, upon a payment of money or delivery of property 
exceeding twenty rupees in amount or value, gives a receipt for amount or 
value not exceeding twenty rupees, or separates or divides the money or 
property paid or delivered shall be punishable with fine which may extend 
to one hundred rupees (Section 65). To constitute an offence under this 
section, an intention to defraud the Government is necessary.  
EP-GCL-5 
300 
 (5) As per Section 66, any person shall be punishable with fine which may 
extend to Rs. 200/- if he –  
 
(a) receives, or takes credit for any premium or consideration for any 
contract of insurance and does not, within one month after receiving or 
taking credit for, such premium or consideration, make out and execute 
a duly stamped policy of such insurance; or 
 
(b) makes, executes or delivers out any policy which is not duly stamped or 
pays or allows in account, or agees to pay or to allow in account, any 
money upon, or in respect of, any such policy.  
 (6) As per Section 67, if any person drawing or executing a bill of exchange 
(payable otherwise than on demand) or a policy of marine insurance 
purporting to be drawn or executed in a set of two or more, and not at the 
same time drawing or executing on paper duly stamped the whole number 
of bills or policies of which such bill or policy purports the set to consist, 
shall be punishable with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees.  
 (7) Any person who, (a) with intent to defraud the Government, of duty, draws, 
makes or issues any bill of exchange or promissory note bearing a date 
subsequent to that on which such bill or note is actually drawn or made; or 
(b) knowing that such bill or note has been so post-dated, endorses, 
transfers, presents for acceptance or payment, or accepts, pays or receives 
payment of, such bill or note; or in any manner negotiates the same;  
(c) with the like intent, practices or is concerned in any act, contrivance or 
device not specially provided for by this Act or any other law for the time 
being in force; shall be punishable with fine which may extend to one 
thousand rupees. Intention to defraud is an essential ingredient for offence 
under Section 68.  
 (8) If any person appointed to sell stamps who disobeys any rule made under 
Section 74, and any person not so appointed who sells or offers for sale 
any stamp [other than a (ten naya paise or five naya paise) adhesive 
stamp] shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend 
to six months, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with 
both (section 69). Before instituting criminal proceedings under this section 
against any person, sanction of the Collector must be obtained. Otherwise, 
the proceedings will be vitiated. A criminal court having jurisdiction to try 
offences under Cr. P.C. can try such offences.  
46. TAKING COGNIZANCE 
 (a) No prosecution in respect of any offence punishable under this Act or any 
Act hereby repealed, shall be instituted without the sanction of the Collector 
or such other officer as the State Government generally or the Collector 
specially, authorises in that behalf.  
 (b) The Chief Controlling Revenue Authority, or any officer generally or 
specially authorised by it in this behalf, may stay any such prosecution or 
compound any such offence.  
 (c) The amount of any such composition shall be recoverable in the manner 
provided by Section 48.  
 
EP-GCL-5 
301 
A Magistrate other than a Presidency Magistrate or a Magistrate whose powers 
are not less than those of a Magistrate of the second class, shall try any offence 
under this Act (Section 71).  
Every such offence committed in respect of any instrument may be tried in any 
district or presidency town in which instrument is found as well as in any district or 
presidency town in which such offence might be tried under the Code of Criminal 
Procedure for the time being in force (Section 72).  
47. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 
Chapter VIII, containing Sections 73 to 78 deals with supplemental provisions 
regarding inspection of relevant registers, books, records, etc; to enter the 
premises for that purpose, powers of Government to frame rules for the sale and 
supply of stamps and to make rules generally to carry out the provisions of the Act.  
Section 77A provides that all stamps in denominations of annas four or multiples 
thereof shall be deemed to be stamps of the value of 25 naya paise or (as the case 
may be), multiples thereof and shall accordingly be valid for all the purposes of the 
Act. From this it can be inferred that whatever the stamp duty is mentioned to be 
annas in the first Schedule; the instrument concerned has to be treated as leviable 
with duty of 25 naye paise or in multiples thereof as the case may be.  
48. SCHEDULE 
The Schedule to the Stamp Act prescribes the rates of stamp duties on 
instruments. Articles 13, 27, 37, 47, 49, 53 and 62(a) of the Schedule relate to 
instruments, the rates of duties on which are prescribed by the Central Legislature 
and have been subject to legislative amendments by that Legislature (See Entry 91 
of List I). The other articles relate to instruments in respect of which the Central 
Legislature has lost its power to regulate rates of duties (except for Union 
Territories) since the passing of the Government of India Act, 1935. With respect to 
these instruments, the rates mentioned are fixed by the State Legislatures (See 
Entry 63 of List II). 
 
LESSON ROUND-UP 
 
 
The Indian Stamp Act, 1899 is the law relating to stamps which consolidates and 
amends the law relating to stamp duty. It is a fiscal legislation envisaging levy of 
stamp duty on certain instruments. 
 
Entry 91 of the Union List, gives power to Union Legislature to levy stamp duty 
with regard to certain instruments (mostly of a commercial character). They are 
bill of exchange, cheques, promissory notes, bill of lading, letters of credit, 
policies of insurance, transfer of shares, debentures, proxies and receipt. 
Likewise, entry 63 of the State List confers on the States power to prescribe the 
rates of stamp duties on other instruments. 
EP-GCL-5 
302 
 
Instrument includes every document by which any right or liability, is, or purported 
to be created, transferred, limited, extended, extinguished or recorded. Any 
instrument mentioned in Schedule I to Indian Stamp Act is chargeable to duty as 
prescribed in the schedule. 
 
In case of sale, mortgage or settlement, if there are several instruments for one 
transaction, stamp duty is payable only on one instrument. On other instruments, 
nominal stamp duty of Re. 1 is payable. If one instrument relates to several 
distinct matters, stamp duty payable is aggregate amount of stamp duties 
payable on separate instruments. 
 
Government can reduce or remit whole or part of duties payable. Such reduction 
or remission can be in respect of whole or part of territories and also can be for 
particular class of persons. Government can also compound or consolidate duties 
in case of issue of shares or debentures by companies. 
 
The payment of stamp duty can be made by adhesive stamps or impressed 
stamps. Instrument executed in India must be stamped before or at the time of 
execution. Instrument executed out of India can be stamped within three months 
after it is first received in India. In some cases, stamp duty is payable on ad 
valorem basis, i.e. on the basis of value of property, etc. In such cases, value is 
decided on prescribed basis. 
 
An instrument not ‗duly stamped‘ cannot be accepted as evidence by civil court, 
an arbitrator or any other authority authorized to receive evidence. However, the 
document can be accepted as evidence in criminal court. Duly stamped means 
that the instrument bears an adhesive or impressed stamp not less than proper 
amount and that such stamp has been affixed or used in accordance with law in 
force in India. 
 
If non-payment or short payment of stamp duty is by accident, mistake or urgent 
necessity, the person can himself produce the document to Collector within one 
year. In such case, Collector may receive the amount and endorse the document 
that proper duty has been paid. 
 
If the company issues securities to one or more depositories, it will have to pay 
stamp duty on total amount of security issued by it and such securities need not be 
stamped. If an investor opts out of depository scheme, the securities surrendered to 
Depository will be issued to him in form of a certificate. Such share certificate 
should be stamped as if a ‗duplicate certificate‘ has been issued. If securities are 
purchased or sold under depository scheme, no stamp duty is payable. 
 
A levy of a penalty or payment in respect of an unstamped or insufficiently 
stamped document does not necessarily exempt a person from liability for 
prosecution for such offence. Revenue Authority has been authorized to refund 
the penalty in excess of duty payable on instrument in certain cases. 
 
The Collector has got the power notwithstanding anything contained in the order 
of the lower court, to prosecute a person if any offence against the Stamp Act 
which he considers that the person has committed in respect of such an 
instrument. The prosecution is instituted when he is satisfied that the offence is 
committed with an intention of evading the proper stamp duty. The order of the 
lower court as to the instrument shall be valid except for the purposes of 
prosecution in this respect. 
 
Provisions have been incorporated to relieve companies renewing debentures 
issued by them from the liability to pay stamp duty on both the original and the 
renewed debenture.

STUDY VI 
LAW RELATING TO REGISTRATION OF DOCUMENTS 
  
 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Registration means recording of the contents of a document with a Registering Officer 
and preservation of copies of the original document. The Registration Act, 1908 is the 
law relating to registration of documents. The object and purpose of the Act among 
other things is to give information to people regarding legal rights and obligations 
arising or affecting a particular property, and to perpetuate documents which may 
afterwards be of legal importance, and also to prevent fraud. It is important for the 
students to be thoroughly acclimatized with this branch of law to know its practical 
significance. 
At the end of the Study Lesson you should be able to understand: 
 
Documents whose registration is compulsory 
 
Documents of which registration is optional 
 
Time-limit for presentation 
 
Re-registration of documents 
 
Documents executed out of India 
 
Presentation of a will for registration 
 
Presenting of documents for registration 
 
Registered document when operative 
 
Effect of non-registration of documents 
 
Certificate of registration 
 
Procedure after registration 
 
Appeal to registrar 
 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
Registration of a document inter alia, ensures its proper preservation and 
record. The Registration Act, 1908 is the law relating to registration  of documents. 
Registration is of a document and not of a transaction.  
304 
 
EP-GCL-6 
305 
2.  REGISTRABLE DOCUMENTS 
Documents can be classified into two classes: 
 
(i) Those whose registration is compulsory; (Section 17) 
 (ii) Those whose registration is optional. (Section 18) 
3.  DOCUMENTS WHOSE REGISTRATION IS COMPULSORY 
According to Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908, documents whose 
registration is compulsory are the following: 
 (a) Instruments of gift of immovable property 
 
 In a case where the donor dies before registration, the document may be 
presented for registration after his death and if registered it will have the 
same effect as registration in his life time. On registration the deed of gift 
operates as from the date of execution. 
 
 It was held by the Privy Council in Kalyana Sundram v. Karuppa, AIR 
1927 PC 42, that while registration is a necessary solemnity for the 
enforcement of a gift of immovable property, it does 
not suspend the gift until registration actually takes 
place, when the instrument of gift has been handed 
over by the donor to the donee and accepted by him, 
the former has done everything in his power to 
complete the donation and to make it effective. And 
if it is presented by a person having necessary 
interest within the prescribed period the Registrar 
must register it. Neither death nor the express revocation by the 
donor, is a ground for refusing registration, provided other conditions 
are complied with. (Cf. Mulla Registration Act (1998), page 36) 
 (b) Other non-testamentary instruments (other than instruments of gift of 
immovable property) which purport or operate to create, declare, assign, 
limit or extinguish, whether in present or in future, any right, title of interest 
whether vested or contingent, of the value of one hundred rupees and 
upwards, to or in immovable property situated in a district in which this Act 
is in force.  
A document which is plainly intended to be operative immediately is non-
testamentary (Umrao Singh v. Lachhman, (1911) 1 LR 33 All 344, 355 (PC); Mulla, 
Registration Act (1998), page 40).  
Description of a document as a will does not make it a will (Tirugnannpal v. 
Poonamma, AIR 1921 PC 89).  
The expressions ―create‖, ―assign‖, ―limit‖ or ―extinguish‖ imply a definite 
change of legal relation to a property by an expression of will embodied in the 
document. It implies a declaration of will.  
The expression ―declare‖ (as used in Section 17) has also to be interpreted on 
the same lines. It does not mean a mere declaration of fact, but connotes a writing 
effectuating a change of relation (Bageshwari Charan v. Jagarnath Kuare, AIR 
1932 PC 55; Mulla, Registration Act (1998), page 41).  
EP-GCL-6 
306 
Whether an instrument requires registration under Section 17(1)(b) depends 
upon whether it operates or purports to bring about a change in legal relation in 
respect of some property. For purposes of Section 17(1)(b) a distinction should be 
drawn between (i) a right in or to property and (ii) such rights as are merely 
incidental to the ownership of property and are really in the nature of powers or 
options which every owner is free to exercise in dealing with his property in a 
particular way. The latter may be described as rights in relation to the property, but 
strictly speaking, they are not rights in or to property. Generally, when a right in or 
to property is assigned, created, declared, limited or extinguished, then there must 
be a definite change of legal relation to the property.  
 (c) Non-testamentary instruments which acknowledge the receipt or payment 
of any consideration on account of the creation, declaration, assignment, 
limitation, or extinction of any such right, title or interest. 
 
 This clause requires an acknowledgement in the form of a receipt to be 
registered, but not an acknowledgement of the fact that a transaction has 
taken place. To be registrable under this clause a receipt must satisfy the 
following two conditions: 
 
(i) it must be the receipt of a consideration; and 
 
(ii) it must on the face of it be an acknowledgement of payment or some 
consideration on account of the creation, declaration, assignment, 
limitation or extinction of an interest of the value of Rs. 100 or upwards 
in immovable property.  
The receipt must be such as to be linked with the creation etc. of a right. A 
mere acknowledgement of payment is not compulsorily registrable. 
Illustration 
In a suit by A against B for lands, B pleads adverse possession. B in defence, 
proves B’s acknowledgement (in a petition to the Collector) that the gift is in her 
favour. The petition is not admissible and does not require registration (Mulla, 
Registration Act (1998), page 69; Bageshwari v. Jagarnath Kuare, AIR 1932 PC 55). 
Delay in registration of a gift does not postpone its 
operation. Section 123, Transfer of Property Act, 1882 
merely requires that donor should have signed the deed of 
gift. Hence a gift deed can be registered even if the donor 
does not agree to its registration (Kalyan Sundaram Pillai 
v. Karuppa Mopanar, AIR 1927 PC 42; Venkata Rama Reddy 
v. Pillai Rama Reddy, AIR 1923 Mad. 282). 
A lease for one year containing an option to the tenant to renew for a further 
period of one year or any other term is not a lease for a term exceeding one year, 
and does not require registration under this clause. Under Section 
107 of the Transfer of Property Act, a lease of one year or reserving 
a yearly rent can be made only by a registered instrument. But 
where the lease is only for one year with a reserved rent for the 
period for which it has been granted, viz. one year, it does not require registration.  
 
EP-GCL-6 
307 
Cases under Section 107 of Transfer of Property Act, and Section 17(1)(d) of 
Registration Act. 
A comparison of both these Sections would show that a lease of immovable 
property is compulsory registrable: 
 (a) if it is from year to year; or 
 (b) if it is for a term exceeding one year; or 
 (c) if it reserves a yearly rent.  
 
 If a lease is of a very high value but is neither from year to year, nor for any 
term exceeding one year, nor reserving a yearly rent, it does not require 
registration under Section 17(1)(d).  
 (d) Non-testamentary instruments transferring or assigning any decree or 
order of a Court or any award in order to create interests as mentioned in 
Clause (b). 
 
 A transfer of a decree or order of a court or of any award when such decree 
or order or award operates to create, declare, etc. any interest of the value 
of Rs. 100 and upwards in immovable property, requires registration.  
 
 However, the State Government is empowered to exempt any leases 
executed which do not exceed five years and the annual rents reserved 
which do not exceed 50 rupees, from the operation of this Sub-section. 
 (e) It may be pointed out that the documents containing contracts to transfer 
for consideration, any immovable property for the purpose of Section 53A 
of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 shall be registered if they have been 
executed on or after the commencement of the Registration and other 
Related Laws (Amendment) Act, 2001 and if such documents are not 
registered on or after such commencement, then they shall have no effect 
for the purposes of the said Section 53A. 
Exceptions to Section 17(1) 
The registration of the non-testamentary documents mentioned in clauses (b) 
and (c) of Section 17(1) is subject to the exceptions provided in Sub-section (2) of 
Section 17. These are as follows: 
 
(i) any composition deed, i.e., every deed the essence of which is 
composition; or 
 (ii) any instrument relating to shares in Joint Stock Company; or 
 (iii) any debentures issued by any such Company; or 
 (iv) any endorsement upon or transfer of any debenture; or 
 (v) any document other than the documents specified under clause (e) above 
creating merely a right to obtain another document which will, when 
executed create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish any such right, title or 
interest; or 
 (vi) any decree or order of a court; or 
 (vii) any grant of immovable property by the Government; or 
 (viii) any instrument of partition made by Revenue-officer; or 
EP-GCL-6 
308 
? 
 (ix) any order granting a loan or instrument of collateral security granted under 
the Land Improvement Act, 1871, or the Land Improvement Loans Act, 
1883; or 
 (x) any order granting loan made under the Agriculturists Loans Act, 1884 or 
instrument for securing the repayment of a loan made under that Act; or 
 (xi) any order made under the Charitable Endowments Act, 1890 vesting any 
property in a treasurer of a charitable endowment or divesting any such 
Treasurer of any property; or 
 (xii) any endorsement on a mortgage deed acknowledging the payment of the 
whole or any part of the mortgage money, and any other receipt for 
payment of money, due under a mortgage when the receipt does not 
purport to extinguish the mortgage; or  
 (xiii) any certificate of sale granted to the purchaser of any property sold by 
public auction by Civil or Revenue Officer. 
Explanation 
A document purporting or operating to effect a contract for the sale of 
immovable property shall not be deemed to require for ever to have required 
registration by reason only of the fact that such document contains a recital of 
payment of any earnest money or of the whole or any part of the purchase money.

State whether the following statement is “True” or “False” 
A mere acknowledgement of payment is always registrable. 
 
True 
 
False 
Correct Answer: False 
  
4.  DOCUMENTS OF WHICH REGISTRATION IS OPTIONAL 
Whereas Section 17 of the Act has made registration of certain documents 
compulsory, Section 18 specifies documents, registration of which is optional. It 
provides that any of the following documents may be registered under this Act, 
namely: 
 (a) instruments (other than instruments of gift and wills) which purport or 
operate to create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish, whether in present or 
in future, any right, title or interest whether vested or contingent, of value 
less than one hundred rupees, to or in immovable property; 
 (b) instruments acknowledging the receipt or payment of any consideration on 
account of the creation, declaration, assignment; limitation or extinction of 
any such right, title or interest;  
 (c) leases of immovable property for any term not exceeding one year and 
leases exempted under Section 17; 
 
EP-GCL-6 
309 
? 
 (d) instruments transferring or assigning any decree or order of a court or any 
award when such decree or order or award purports or operates to create, 
declare, assign, limit or extinguish, whether in present or in future, any 
right, title or interest, whether vested or contingent of a value less than one 
hundred rupees, to or in immovable property; 
 (e) instruments (other than wills) which purport or operate to create declare, 
assign, limit or extinguish any right, title or interest to or in movable 
property;  
 
(f) wills; and 
 (g) other documents not required by Section 17 to be registered. (Section 18) 
5.  TIME LIMIT FOR PRESENTATION 
A document other than a will must be presented within 
four months of its execution. In cases of urgent necessity, 
etc. the period is eight months, but higher fee has to be 
paid (Sections 23-26). These limits are mandatory (Ram 
Singh v. Jasmer Singh, AIR 1963 Punj. 100). If delay is due 
to act of Court, it has to be disregarded (Raj Kumar v. 
Tarapa, AIR 1987 SC 2195).  
Section 23, proviso prescribes a period of four months for presenting a copy of 
a decree or order. It is counted from the date of the decree.  
Unstamped document 
If the document is not sufficiently stamped its presentation is still good 
presentation though penalty under the Stamp Act can be levied (Mahaliram v. 
Upendra Nath, AIR 1960 Pat 470).

State whether the following statement is “True” or “False” 
According to Section 17, registration of instruments of gift of immovable property is 
compulsory. 
 
True 
 
False 
Correct Answer: True 
 
6.  RE-REGISTRATION 
Section 23A provides for the re-registration of certain documents. The section 
is mainly intended to deal with situations where the original presentation was by a 
person not duly authorised. It overrides the decision in Jambu Prasad v. 
Mohammed Aftab Ali Khan, (1914) ILR 37 All 49). 
EP-GCL-6 
310 
7.  SEVERAL EXECUTANTS 
Under Section 24 a document executed by several persons at different times 
may be presented for registration and re-registration within four months from the 
date of each execution.  
The registration is ―partial‖ in regard to each party. (Mulla, Registration Act 
(1998), page 163) 
8.  DOCUMENTS EXECUTED OUT OF INDIA 
As per Section 26 Where the registering officer is satisfied that the document 
was executed outside India and it has been presented for registration within four 
months after its arrival in India, he may accept such document for registration on 
payment of proper registration fee. A document executed outside India is not 
valid unless it is registered in India (Nainsukhdas v. Gowardhandas, AIR 1948 
Nag. 110).  
Incidentally, Section 26 indicates that the Act applies to ex-India documents 
relating to property in India. (Mulla, page 166) 
8A.  PRESENTATION OF A WILL 
Section 27  provides that a will may be presented for registration at any time or 
deposited in a manner provided in Sections 40-46. Registration of a will is optional 
under Section 18(e).  
9.  PLACE OF REGISTRATION 
Section 28 provides that documents affecting immovable property mentioned in 
Sections 17(1) and (2) and Sections 17(1)(a)(b)(c) and (cc)(d) and (e),  
Section 17(2), etc. shall be presented for registration in the office of a Sub-
Registrar within whose sub-district the whole or some portion of the relevant 
property is situated and any other document may be presented for registration 
either in the office of the Sub-Registrar in whose sub-district the document was 
executed or in the office of any other Sub-Registrar under the State Government at 
which all the persons executing desire the document to be registered. (All these 
documents relate to immovable property). Registration of a document elsewhere 
has been held to be void (Harendra Lal Roy Chowdhuri v. Hari Dasi Debi, (1914) 
ILR 41 Cal. 972, 988 (PC); Mulla, Registration Act (1998), page 167 and cases in 
footnote 2).  
There is nothing in law to prohibit a person conveying property in one district 
and residing and owing property in another district and asking the vendee to accept 
a conveyance also of some small property in the district in which he resides, so that 
the sale-deed may be registered there and he may not be put to the trouble and 
expense of a journey to the other district. It is not correct to say in such a case that 
the sale-deed is not validly registered at the place where it is got registered.  
However, there should be no fraud or collusion. Smallness of the area does not 
necessarily lead to inference of fraud. (Mulla Registration Act (1998), pages 169-
171. See in particular the cases cited in Mulla page 170, footnotes 15-19).  
10.  COPY OF A DECREE OR ORDER 
A copy of a decree or order may be registered with the Sub-Registrar within 
whose sub-district it was made. If the decree or order does not affect immovable 
 
EP-GCL-6 
311 
property, it may be presented for registration in the office of any other Sub-
Registrar under the State Government at whose office all persons claiming under 
the decree or order desire it to be registered.  
10A.  REGISTRATION IN CERTAIN CITIES 
In any city comprising a Presidency town or in Delhi, a document relating to 
property situated any where in India may be registered (Section 30). Delhi was 
added by Amendment Act 45 of 1969.  
Under Section 31, registration is permitted in cases of necessity under extra-
ordinary circumstances, at the residence of the executant.  
11.  PRESENTING OF DOCUMENTS FOR REGISTRATION 
Section 32 specifies the persons who can present documents for registration at 
the proper registration office. Such persons are as follows: 
 (a) some person executing or claiming under the same, or in the case of a 
copy of a decree or order, claiming under the decree or order, or 
 (b) the representative or assign of such person, or 
 (c) the agent of such person, representative or assign, duly authorised by 
power-of-attorney executed and authenticated in the manner hereinafter 
mentioned.  
It is immaterial whether the registration is compulsory or optional; but, if 
it is presented for registration by a person other than a party not mentioned 
in Section 32, such presentation is wholly inoperative and the registration of 
such a document is void (Kishore Chandra Singh v. Ganesh Prashad Singh, 
AIR 1954 SC 316). However, Sections 31, 88 and 89 provide exceptions to this 
requirement.  
For the purpose of Section 32, a special power of attorney is required as 
provided under Section 33. A general power of attorney will not do. Section 33 
requires that a power of attorney, in order to be recognised as giving authority to 
the agent to get the document registered, should be executed before and then 
authenticated by the Registrar within whose district or sub-district the principal 
resides. (Sections 32 to 35) 
12. ENQUIRY BEFORE REGISTRATION BY REGISTERING OFFICER 
For registering a document the persons executing such document or their 
representatives, assigns or authorised agents must appear before the registering 
officer within the time allowed for presentation. (Section 34) 
In Section 34, the expression ―person executing‖ not only includes the agent 
who has signed (with authority), but also the principal who is a party (Puran Chand 
v. Manmotho Nath, AIR 1928 PC 38).  
It is the compliance with the provisions of Sections 34, 35, 58 and 59 of the Act, 
which really constitutes registration and not the presence of the certificate. Hence, 
subsequent acts of the Registrar which are ministerial acts, cannot affect the 
validity of the registration and the absence of final certificate of registration under 
section 60 cannot affect its validity.

13.  PRESENTING WILLS AND AUTHORITIES TO ADOPT 
 (a) Who is entitled to present Wills and authorises to adopt 
 
 The testator, or after his death, any person claiming as executor or 
otherwise under a will, may present it to any Registrar or Sub-Registrar for 
registration. In case of authority for adoption, the donor or (after his death) 
the donee, or any authority to adopt, or the adoptive son, may present it to 
any Registrar or Sub-Registrar for registration. (Section 40) Thus, even a 
legatee can present a will (Venkatapayya v. Venkata Ranga, AIR 1929 PC 
24).  
 (b) Registration of will and authority to adopt 
 
(i) A will, or an authority to adopt, if presented by the testator or the donor, 
may be registered in the same manner as any other document. 
[Section 41(1)] 
 
(ii) If presented by any other person entitled to present it, it shall be 
registered if the registering officer is satisfied about the particulars 
mentioned in Section 41(2).  
13A.  DEPOSIT OF WILLS 
Any testator may, either personally or by duly authorised agent, deposit with 
any Registrar his will in a sealed cover superscribed with the name of the testator 
and that of his agent, if any, and with a statement of the nature of the document.  
On receiving such documents, the Registrar on being satisfied shall transcribe 
in his Registrar Book No. 5, the superscription and shall note the date, time, month, 
etc. of such receipt and shall then place and retain the sealed cover in his fire-proof 
box.  
However, the testator may withdraw it by applying for the same and the 
Registrar shall deliver it accordingly (Sections 42 to 46). 
14.  REGISTERED DOCUMENT WHEN OPERATIVE 
 
(a) A registered document shall operate from the time from 
which it would have commenced to operate if no registration thereof 
had been required or made and not from the time of its registration. 
(Section 47) 
 
EP-GCL-6 
313 
 (b) As between two registered documents, the date of execution 
determines the priority. Of the two registered documents, executed by 
same persons in respect of the same property to two different persons 
at two different times, the one which is executed first gets priority 
over the other, although the former deed is registered subsequently to 
the later one (K.J. Nathan v. S.V. Maruthi Rai, AIR 1965 SC 430; Mulla 
page 207).  
In effect1 Section 47 means that a document operates from the date of execution 
(as between the parties). (Mulla, Registration Act (1998), pages 207, 209) 
15. REGISTERED DOCUMENT RELATING TO PRIORITY WHEN TO TAKE 
EFFECT AGAINST ORAL AGREEMENT 
Generally, priority to rights accorded by different transfers is governed by the 
principles embodied in the maxim qui prior tempore potior est jure that is ―he who is 
first in time is better in law‖. But this general rule is subject to exceptions created by 
Sections 48 and 50. Section 48 refers to the priority of the registered agreements 
over oral agreements and Section 50 refers to the priority of registered agreements 
over non-registered agreements. (Section 48) 
Notice 
In spite of the explicit wording of Section 48, it has for long time been held, that 
a subsequent registered deed will not prevail over a prior unregistered deed or a 
prior oral transaction if the subsequent transferee had notice of the prior 
transaction. (Mulla Registration Act (1998), pages 215-216) 
16. 
EFFECT OF NON-REGISTRATION OF DOCUMENTS 
REQUIRED TO BE REGISTERED 
Section 49 of the Act provides that no document required by 
Section 17 or by any provision of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 to be 
registered shall: 
 (a) affect any immovable property comprised therein; or 
 (b) confer any power to adopt; or 
 (c) be received as evidence of any transaction affecting such property or 
conferring such power unless it has been registered. 
Section 49 is mandatory, and a document which is required to be registered 
cannot be received in evidence as affecting immovable property. (Mulla, pages 223 
to 228) 
An unregistered document which comes within Section 17 cannot be used in 
any legal proceeding to bring out indirectly the effect which it would have if 
registered.  
However, as provided in Section 49, proviso, an unregistered document 
                                                          
1. Section 47 does not affect rules of personal law requiring possession. [Mulla (1998), page 209]. 
EP-GCL-6 
314 
affecting immovable property and required by this Act or the Transfer of property 
Act, 1882 to be registered may be received as evidence of a contract in a suit for 
specific performance or as evidence of part performance of a contract for the 
purposes of Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 or as evidence of 
any collateral transaction not to be effective by registered instrument. All that the 
proviso to Section 49 permits is that in a suit for specific performance an 
unregistered document affecting immovable property may be given in evidence. 
The purpose is that the document which has not conveyed or passed title may still 
be used as evidence of the terms. In K. Narasimha Rao v. Sai Vishnu, AIR 2006 
NOC (A.P.) p. 80, it has been held that: 
It is settled legal principle that an unstamped instrument is not at all 
admissible in evidence even for collateral purpose. But an unregistered 
instrument 
originally 
unstamped, 
if 
duly 
stamped 
subsequently can be admitted in evidence even though it 
continues to be unregistered for collateral purpose but 
actual terms of transaction cannot be looked into. In 
instant case, however settlement deed in question 
produced by defendant was not only unregistered but also 
insufficiently stamped. That apart on an objection raised 
by plaintiff, Court had already passed an order directing 
impounding of document, which was never complied with by defendant. In 
such 
circumstances, 
document 
in 
question, 
which 
still 
remained 
insufficiently stamped could not be admitted in evidence even for collateral 
purpose. Application filed by defendant seeking to admit said document for 
collateral purpose is liable to be dismissed. 
17. REGISTERED DOCUMENTS RELATING TO PROPERTY WHEN TO TAKE 
EFFECT AGAINST ORAL AGREEMENT 
Registered documents relating to any property whether movable or immovable 
shall take effect against any oral agreements or declaration relating to such 
property unless followed by delivery of possession which constitutes a valid transfer 
under any law for the time being in force. (Section 48) 
18. CERTAIN REGISTERED DOCUMENTS RELATING TO LAND WHICH WILL 
TAKE EFFECT AGAINST UNREGISTERED DOCUMENTS 
Section 50 provides as under: 
 (1) Every document of the kinds mentioned in clause (a), (b), (c) and (d) of 
Section 17, Sub-section (1) and clauses (a) and (b) of Section 18, shall if 
duly registered, take effect as regards the property, comprised therein, 
against every unregistered document relating to the same property, and not 
being a decree or order, whether such unregistered document be of the 
same nature as the registered document or not.  
 (2) Nothing in Sub-section (1) applies to leases exempted under the proviso to 
Sub-section (1) of Section 17 or to any document mentioned in Sub-section 
(2) of the same section or to any registered document which had no priority 
under the law in force at the commencement of this Act.

The registering officer should give a receipt for such document to the person 
presenting it and shall make a copy of the document in the appropriate book.  
All such books shall be authenticated from time to time as prescribed by the 
Inspector General. (Sections 51 to 57) 
20.  PROCEDURE ON ADMISSION TO REGISTRATION

certificate containing the word ―registered‖ along with the number, and page 
of the book in which the document has been copied. The certificate shall be 
signed, sealed and dated by the registering officer.  
 (b) The certificate of registration in respect of a document is prima facie an 
evidence that the document has been legally registered and raises a 
presumption that the registering officer proceeded in accordance with the 
law. (Section 60) (See Mulla (1998), pages 296, 297) 
22. PROCEDURE AFTER REGISTRATION OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO

 (1) Every Sub-Registrar refusing to register a document, except on the ground 
that the property to which it relates is not situate within his sub-district, shall 
make an order of refusal and record his reasons for such order in his Book 
No. 2 and endorse the words ―Registration refused‖ on the document; and, 
on application made by any person executing or claiming under the 
document, shall without payment and unnecessary delay, give him a copy 
of the reasons so recorded.  
 (2) No registering officer shall accept for registration a document so endorsed 
unless and untill, under the provisions hereinafter contained, the document

Correct Answer: (a) 
 
24A.  APPEAL TO REGISTRAR 
According to Section 72(1), an appeal shall lie against an order of a Sub-
Registrar refusing to admit a document to registration (whether the registration of 
such document is compulsory or optional) to the Registrar to whom such Sub-
Registrar is subordinate if presented to such Registrar within thirty days from the 
date of the order; and the Registrar may reverse or alter such order. This does not 
apply where the refusal is on the ground of denial of execution.  
If the order of the Registrar directs the document to be registered and the 
document is duly presented for registration within thirty days after the making of 
such order, the Sub-Registrar shall obey the same, and thereupon shall, so far as 
may be practicable, follow the procedure prescribed in Sections 58, 59 and 60; and 
such registration shall take effect as if the document had been registered when it 
was first duly presented for registration. [Section 72(2)] 
EP-GCL-6 
318 
? 
24B.  APPLICATION TO REGISTRAR 
Refusal to register on the ground of denial of execution is governed by  
Section 73, under which the aggrieved party can make an ―application‖ not appeal 
to the Registrar. (Section 73) (For denial of execution see Section 35) 
25.  PROCEDURE BEFORE THE REGISTRAR 
In the case falling under Section 73 (refusal to register on the ground of denial 
of execution before the Sub-Registrar) and also where denial of registration is 
made before the Registrar himself, the Registrar shall inquire: 
 (a) whether the document has been executed; and 
 (b) whether the requirements of the law have been satisfied so as to entitle the 
document to registration. (Section 74) 
If a person denies execution, the Sub-Registrar must refuse registration 
leaving the parties to appeal under Section 73 (Chhotey Lal v. Collector of 
Moradabad, AIR 1922 PC 279). Ultimate remedy is a suit under Section 77 (Ka 
Plinis Mysthong v. Ring Pyrbot, AIR 1965 A.N. 42).  
26.  ORDER BY REGISTRAR TO REGISTER AND PROCEDURE THEREON 
If the Registrar finds that the document has been executed and that the said 
requirements have been complied with, he shall order the document to be 
registered (Section 75). 
27.  INSTITUTION OF SUIT IN CASE OF ORDER OF REFUSAL BY REGISTRAR 
Where the Registrar refuses to order the document to be registered any person 
claiming under such document, or his representative, assign or agent, may, within 
thirty days after the making of the order of refusal, institute in the Civil Court, within 
the local limits of whose original jurisdiction is situate the office in which the 
document is sought to be registered a suit for a decree directing the document to 
be registered in such office if it be duly presented for registration within thirty days 
after the passing of such decree. (Section 77)

require, or to have at any time required, the registration of any of the following 
documents or maps, namely: 
 
(a) documents issued, received or attested by any officer engaged in 
making a settlement or revision of settlement of land revenue and 
which form part of the records of such settlement; or 
 
(b) documents and maps issued, received or authenticated by any officer 
engaged on behalf of Government in making or revising the survey of 
any land which form part of the record of such survey; or 
 
(c) documents which, under any law for the time being in force are filed 
periodically in any revenue office by patwaris or other officers charged 
with the preparation of village records; or 
 
(d) sanads, inam, title deeds and other documents purporting to be an 
evidence, grants or assignments by Government of land or of any 
interest in land; or

Revenue Code, 1879 of relinquishment of occupancy by occupants or 
of land by holders of such land.  
 (2) All such documents and maps shall for the purposes of Sections 48 and 49, 
be deemed to have been, and to be, registered in accordance with the 
provisions of this Act. (Section 90) 
  
LESSON ROUND-UP 
 
 
Registration of documents relating to immovable property is compulsory. 
Registration of  will is optional. Some documents though related to immovable 
property are not required to be registered. These are given in Section 17(2) of the 
Act. 
 
Document should be submitted for registration within four months from date of 
execution. Decree or order of Court can be submitted within four months from the 
day it becomes final. If document is executed by several persons at different 
times, it may be presented for registration within four months from date of each 
execution. If a document is executed abroad by some of the parties, it can be 
presented for registration within four months after its arrival in India. 
 
If a person finds that a document has been filed for registration by a person who 
is not empowered to do so, he   can   present the document for re-registration 
within four months from the date he became aware of the fact that registration of 
document is invalid. 
 
Documents relating to immovable property should be registered in the office of 
Sub-Registrar of sub-district within which the whole or some portion of property is 
EP-GCL-6 
320 
situated. Other documents can be registered in the office of Sub-Registrar. 
Where all persons executing the document desire it to be registered. Registrar 
can accept a document which is registrable with Sub-Registrar who is 
subordinate to him. Document should be presented for registration at the office of 
Registrar/Sub-Registrar. However, in special case, the officer may attend 
residence of any person to accept a document or will. 
 
All persons executing the document or their representatives, assign or agents 
holding power of attorney must appear before registering officer. They have to 
admit execution and sign the document in presence of Registrar, as required 
under Section 58(1)(a). Appearance may be simultaneous or at different times. If 
some of the persons are unable to appear within four months, further time upto 
additional four months can be given on payment of fine upto 10 times the proper 
registration fee. 
 
If the Registering Officer is satisfied about identity of persons and if they admit 
about execution of documents, and after registration fees are paid, the registering 
officer will register the document. He will make necessary entries in the Register 
maintained by him. 
 
After all formalities are complete, the Registering Officer will endorse the 
document with the word ‗Registered‘, and sign the same. The endorsement will 
be copied in Register. After registration, the document will be returned to the 
person who presented the document. 
 
A document takes effect from its date of execution and not from date of 
registration. However, if the document states that it will be effective from a 
particular date, it will be effective from that date. 
 
Any non-testamentary document registered under the Act takes effect against 
any oral agreement relating to the property. The only exceptions are: (a) if 
possession of property (movable or immovable) is delivered on the basis of such 
oral agreement and such delivery of possession is valid transfer under any law 
(b) mortgage by deposit of title deeds takes effect against any mortgage deed 
subsequently executed and registered which relates to some property.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
―Information technology‖, in a broad sense, connotes that technology which is 
connected with information. More particularly, it connotes that technology which has 
taken shape during the last five decades or so, involving electronics. The use of 
such technology for the storage, retrieval and dissemination of information has 
given rise to several legal, social and ethical problems. In this context, the word 
―information‖ is not to be taken as limited to news or informative material. Rather, it 
is to be understood as encompassing all matter that is intended to be recorded 
electronically, whether it be correspondence, Government documents, legal 
instruments, private exchanges of news and views or any other matter which 
emanates from man and is transformed into machine-recorded data.  
2.  LEGAL PROBLEMS - THEIR NATURE AND DIMENSIONS  
Information technology gives rise to a variety of legal problems. The problems 
themselves are not novel, in their essential character.  But they deserve special 
322 
 
EP-GCL-7 
323 
treatment, because of the environment in which they take their birth and the nature 
of the machinery used in the environment and the means employed for recording 
the information in question. Traditional documents are stored and transmitted 
through the use of visible and tangible letters, figures and marks, while information 
which is stored and transmitted electronically, has no visible shape or tangible form. 
It is this peculiarity of the technology, that gives rise to a variety of legal problems. 
These problems can be generally resolved on principles already known to the legal 
system. But in view of their subject matter, they may necessitate some adjustments 
in, and additions to, the content of the law. 
The Machine, the Medium and the Message 
The majority of the legal problems that arise in this sphere are relatable to the 
following components of information technology, namely - 
 (a) The machine (i.e. the instrument used in the technology) 
 (b) The medium used for the purpose (i.e. the symbols and, other means, used 
for recording and transmitting the information) and   
 (c) The message, i.e. the information which is stored or transmitted, through 
the above medium. 
A few illustrations will make the matter clear.  
First, so far as the computers are concerned, they can be tampered with, and 
made to give out results that were never intended. The law has therefore to 
concern itself with the question whether any, and if so, what additional provisions, 
are needed, to deal with this aspect. 
Secondly, there is the question of the medium. Communications with the 
assistance of information technology-particularly through the Internet- cross the 
borders of various countries. They are transnational in character and raise, inter 
alia, problems of jurisdiction. Besides this, the medium by which information is 
recorded - i.e. the operational symbols - are radically different, from the means 
employed in traditional writing or printing.  Traditional means, such as letters, 
numerals or punctuation marks, are not put into the computer in their original form 
(though they do come out in the final print out, in traditional form). 
Finally, as regards the message transmitted through information technology, 
there are certain special issues that fail to be considered. No doubt, the print-out 
that issues from the computer is not substantially different from typed matter. But 
matter put on the internet may, by reason of its content, come into conflict with the 
law of the country where it emanates or the law of the country where it is received. 
How far, is each of these countries legally equipped, to deal with such 
infringement? The answer to this question will depend on the substance of the laws 
of the country concerned. If the contravention is to be examined from the point of 
view of the criminal law, the exact text of the penal statute becomes material.  
The Legal Response 
For dealing with issues of the nature mentioned above (as arising out of the use 
of information technology), some countries have enacted specific legislation. In 
EP-GCL-7 
324 
? 
India, the Information Technology Act, 2000, is an example of such legislation. 
However, in the absence of specific legislation, or in regard to matters not covered 
by such specific legislation, the legal problems that arise will be governed by 
general principles of law  - which are often referred to as principles of ―Common 
Law‖. 
The Uncodified Law 
These principles belong to the uncodified law of India. For example, if, X sends 
out, on the internet, messages that are defamatory of Y, then (apart from instituting 
a criminal prosecution) Y has the right to sue for damages for defamation, which is 
a tort (a species of a civil wrong, independent of contract). Such a remedy is 
available to Y, under the law of torts, which is mostly based upon judicial decisions 
dealing with various kinds of civil wrongs. In such matters, the Information 
Technology Act, 2000, would not supply a complete answer. 
3.  THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACT - ITS ROLE 
Of course, in regard to matters which are dealt with in the 
Information Technology Act, 2000, its specific provisions will apply. 
But a few observations have to be made in this context. The first is, 
that besides the Information Technology Act, there are other 
statutory provisions (as contained in certain other Acts), which are also relevant to 
information technology. In fact, regarding some of these Acts, the Information 
Technology Act itself has effected specific amendments. These include, the Indian 
Penal Code, the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, the Bankers‘ Book Evidence Act, 1891 
and the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934.  
Secondly, even before the Information Technology Act, 2000, came into force, 
Parliament had provided for the maintenance of computerised records, by 
amending the legislation in force relating to customs, excise and companies. 
Thirdly, as pointed out above, many legal issues arising out of the use of 
information technology will continue to be dealt with, by common law rules. Torts 
are an outstanding example. Thus, it can be said that a study of Information 
Technology law has to begin with a study of the Information Technology Act, 2000, 
but cannot end with it.

4.  MAIN OBJECT AND GENERAL SCHEME OF THE ACT 
The Information Technology Act, 2000 (Central Act 21 of 2000), was 
enacted to make, in the main, three kinds of provisions, as under: 
 
(a) It provides legal recognition for transactions carried out by 
means of electronic data interchange and other means of electronic

EP-GCL-7 
327 
? 
 (xii) ―originator‖ means a person who sends, generates, stores or transmits any

(b) the initial electronic record is retained intact, or has been altered  since 
such electronic record was so affixed with the digital signature. [Section 
2(1)(zh)] 
6.  DIGITAL SIGNATURE 
Digital signature (i.e. authentication of an electronic record by a subscriber, by 
electronic means) is recognised as a valid method of authentication. The 
authentication is to be effected by the use of ―asymmetric crypto system and hash 
function‖, which envelop and transform electronic record into another electronic 
record. [Sections 3(1), 3(2)] 
Verification of the electronic record is done by the use of a public key of the 
subscriber. [Section 3(3)] The private key and the public key are unique to the 
subscriber and constitute a functioning ―key pair‖. 
 
Test your knowledge 
State whether the following statement is “True” or “False” 
Addressee is a person who is supposed to receive the information by the originator 
of the message through an intermediary. 
Correct Answer: False 
 
7. 
E- GOVERNANCE (LEGAL RECOGNITION OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS) 
The Act grants legal recognition to electronic records by laying down that where 
(by any law) ―information‖ or any other matter is to be in: 
 (a) writing or  
 (b) typewritten form or 
 (c) printed form, 
EP-GCL-7 
328 
? 
then, such requirement is satisfied, if such information or matter is: 
 
(i) rendered or made available in an electronic form; and 
 (ii) accessible, so as to be usable for a subsequent reference. (Section 4) 
It may be pointed out that ―information‖, as defined in Section 2(1)(v) of the Act, 
includes data, text, images, sound, voice, codes, computer programmes, software 
and data-bases or micro-film or computer-generated ―micro-fiche‖. 
Private transactions 
Thus, Section 4 of the Information Technology Act, practically equates 
electronic record with a manual or typed or printed record. The next Section 
proceeds to achieve the same object in regard to signature. Where any law 
provides that information or any other matter shall be ―signed‖, such requirement is 
satisfied by authentication through digital signature in the prescribed manner. 
(Section 5) 
Thus, while the text of the information is dealt with in section 4, the signature 
thereto, is taken care of, by Section 5.  
Public records 
Above provisions are primarily intended for private transactions. The Act then 
proceeds to bring in the regime of electronic records and digital signature in public 
records, by making an analogous provision which grants recognition to electronic 
records and digital signatures, in cases where any law provides for  
 (a) the filing of any form, application or any other document with a 
Governmental  office or agency or  
 (b) the grant of any licence, permit etc. or   
 (c) the receipt or payment of money in a particular manner. (Section 6) 
8.  RETENTION OF INFORMATION 
 The Act also seeks to permit the retention of information in electronic form, 
where any law provides that certain documents, records or information shall be 
retained for any specific period. Certain conditions as to accessibility, format etc are 
also laid down. (Section 7) 
9.  SUBORDINATE LEGISLATION 
Subordinate legislation is also authorised, by the Act, to be published in the 
Official Gazette or the electronic Gazette, and the date of its first publication in either 
of the two Gazette shall be deemed to be the date of publication. (Section 8) 
But the provisions summarised above shall not confer any right upon any 
person to insist, that any Government agency shall accept, issue etc. any document 
in electronic form or effect any monetary transaction in electronic form. (Section 9) 
 
Test your knowledge 
State whether the following statement is “True” or “False” 
In ‗asymmetric crypto system‘, a public key is used to create a digital signature and 
a private key to verify the digital signature. 
Correct Answer: False 
 
EP-GCL-7 
329 
10.  ATTRIBUTION AND DISPATCH OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS 
Since, in an electronic record, the maker remains behind the curtain, it was 
considered desirable to make a provision for ―attribution‖ of the record. An 
electronic record is attributed to the ―originator‖. [defined in Section 2(1)(za)]  
Broadly, the ―originator‖ is the person at whose instance it was sent in the 
following cases - 
 (a) if it  was sent by the originator himself; or 
 (b) if it was sent by a person authorised to act on behalf of the originator in 
respect of that electronic record; or  
 (c) if it was sent by an information system programmed by or on behalf of the 
originator to operate automatically. (Section 11) 
Regarding acknowledgement of receipt of electronic records, the Act provides 
that where there is no agreement that the acknowledgment be given in a particular 
form etc. then the acknowledgement may be given by: 
 (a) any communication by the addressee (automated or otherwise) or 
 (b) any conduct of the addressee which is sufficient to indicate to the originator 
that the electronic record has been received. [Section 12(1)] 
Special provisions have been made for cases where the originator has 
stipulated for receipt of acknowledgment, [Section 12(b)] or where the 
acknowledgement is not received by the originator in time. [Section 12(2), 12(3)] 
Time and Place of Dispatch etc. 
After these provisions, there follows a provision which is of considerable 
significance for the law of contracts. The date of offer and the date of acceptance 
are crucial, in determining whether and which contract has come into existence. 
The two terminal points - despatch and receipt, are dealt with, in detail. Subject to 
agreement between the parties, the dispatch of an electronic record occurs, when it 
enters a ―computer resource‖ outside the control of the originator.  [Section 13(1)] 
―Computer resource‖, as defined in Section 2(k), means a computer, computer 
system, computer network, data, computer database or software.  
Time of receipt 
As regards the time of receipt of electronic records, two situations are dealt 
with, separately. Subject to agreement, if the addressee has designated a computer 
resource for receipt, then receipt occurs when the electronic record enters the 
designated resource. However, if the record is sent to a computer resource of the 
addressee which is not the designated resource, then receipt occurs at the time 
when the electronic record is retrieved by the addressee. [Section 13(2)(a)] 
If the addressee has not designated a computer resource (with or without 
specified timings), then receipt is deemed to occur, when the electronic record 
EP-GCL-7 
330 
? 
enters the computer resource of the addressee. [Sections 13(1), 13(2)] Above 
provisions apply, even where the place of location of the computer is different from 
the deemed place of receipt.  
The Act also contains provisions as to the place of dispatch and receipt. 
[Section 13(3)] 
 
Test your knowledge 
State whether the following statement is “True” or “False” 
Under the Indian law, a person has a right to demand a Government agency to 
accept an electronic record. 
Correct Answer: False 
 
11.  SECURE ELECTRONIC RECORDS 
The Central Government is required, by the Act, to prescribe the security 
procedure for electronic records, having regard to the commercial circumstances 
prevailing at the time when the procedure is used (Section 16). When the 
procedure has been applied to an electronic record at a specific point of time, then 
such record is deemed to be a secure electronic record, from such point of time to 
the time of verification. (Section 14) Suitable provision is also made regarding 
―secure digital signature‖. 
A digital signature is deemed to be a secure digital signature, if, by the 
application of an agreed security procedure, it can be verified that a digital 
signature, at the time it was verified, - 
 (a) was unique to the subscriber affixing it; 
 (b) was capable of identifying such subscriber; 
 (c) was created in a manner or using a means under the exclusive control of 
the subscriber and is linked to the electronic  record to which it relates, in 
such a manner that if the electronic record was altered, the digital signature 
would be invalidated. (Section 15) 
12.  CERTIFYING AUTHORITIES 
A system of digital signature of an electronic communication pre-supposes that 
the sender must create a ―public -private key‖ pair. The private key, which is kept 
confidential, is used by the signer to create the digital signature. The public key 
(which is more widely known), is used by the relying party, to verify the digital 
signature. 
To associate a key pair with a certifying prospective signer, the Certifying 
Authority issues a certificate to the subscriber. (Section 35) 
The Act contains detailed provisions as to ―Certifying Authorities‖ (Sections 17-
34). A Certifying Authority is expected to reliably identify persons applying for 
 
EP-GCL-7 
331 
? 
―signature key certificates‖, reliably verify their legal capacity and confirm the 
attribution of a public signature key to an identified physical person by means of a 
signature key certificate. To regulate the Certifying Authorities, there is a Controller 
of Certifying Authorities. (Section 17) 
Foreign Certifying Authorities may be recognised by the Controller. (Section 19) 
The Controller acts as the repository of all Digital Signature Certificates, issued 
under the Act. [Section 20(1)] 
―Repositories‖ are on-line data-bases of certificates and other information, 
available for retrieval and use in verifying digital signatures. Obligations of 
Certifying Authorities are also set out, in the Act. (Sections 30-34) 
Digital signature certificates 
Sections 35-39 of the Act deal with Digital Signature Certificates. 
Duties of subscribers  
Duties of subscribers are dealt with, in the Information Technology Act, in some 
detail. (Sections 40-42) 
 
Test your knowledge 
A digital signature is: 
 (a) Unique to the subscriber affixing it 
 (b) Capable of identifying the subscriber 
 (c) Capable of identifying the addressee 
 (d) Created in a manner or using a means under the exclusive control of the 
subscriber 
Correct Answer: (a), (b), (d) 
 
13.  PENALTIES AND ADJUDICATIONS 
The Act contemplates a dual scheme in regard to wrongful acts concerning 
computers etc. Certain acts are visited with (so called) ―penalties‖, which are 
however, adjudicated, not before courts, but before adjudication officers. (Sections 
43-47) 
In fact, however, though the heading of Section 43 speaks of ―penalty‖, the text 
of Section 43 imposes only a liability ―to pay damages by way of compensation not 
exceeding one crore rupees‖, to the person harmed by the tort. The acts so dealt 
with, include the following – 
 (a) accessing or securing access to the computer network; 
 (b) down-loading any data or information from the computer network; 
 (c) introducing (or causing to be introduced) any computer contaminant or 
computer virus, into the computer/network; 
EP-GCL-7 
332 
? 
 (d) damaging (or causing to be damaged) the computer/network, data, 
computer data-base or any other programmes residing in it; 
 (e) disrupting (or causing the disruption of) the computer/network; 
 
(f) denying access (or causing the denial of access) to any person authorised 
to access the computer/network, by any means; 
 (g) providing assistance to any person to facilitate access to the computer 
network in contravention of the provisions of the Act, rules etc. 
 (h) charging the service availed of, by a person, to the account of another 
person, by tampering with or manipulating any computer network  
(Section 43). 
The Explanation to the Section sets out definitions of the expressions 
―computer contaminant‖, ―computer database‖, ―computer virus‖ and ―damages‖.  
A person failing to provide information or failing to file a return etc. (as required 
by the Act), has to pay a penalty not exceeding ten thousand rupees for every day 
during which the failure continues. (Section 44) 
Contravention of a rule or regulation attracts liability to pay compensation upto 
25,000 rupees, to the person affected by such contravention or to pay penalty upto 
that amount. (Section 45) 
Adjudicating officer 
An adjudication officer is to be appointed by the Central Government for 
adjudging (under this Chapter) whether any person has committed a contravention 
of the Act or of any rule, regulation, direction or order issued under the Act. He may 
impose penalty or award compensation in accordance with the provisions of the 
relevant section (Section 46). 
The Act takes-care to set out the factors to be taken into account by the 
Adjudicating officer, in adjudging the quantum of compensation under this Chapter. 
He has to have due regard to the following factors: 
 (a) the amount of gain or unfair advantage (wherever quantifiable), made as a  
result of the default; 
 (b) the amount of loss caused to any person as a result of the default; and 
 (c) the repetitive nature of the default.

14.  CYBER REGULATIONS APPELLATE TRIBUNAL 
Chapter 10 of the Act provides for the establishment of one or more Cyber 
Regulations Appellate Tribunal and lays down various provisions regarding its 
jurisdiction, composition, powers and procedure. (Sections 48-62) 
In the same Chapter, there are provisions regarding the compounding of 
offences and recovery of penalties. (Sections 63 and 64).  
Any person aggrieved by an order of the Controller of Certifying Authorities or 
of the adjudicator can appeal to the Cyber Appellate Tribunal, within 45 days. 
(Section 57) 
Each Cyber Appellate Tribunal is to consist of only one person (called the 
presiding officer). He must be a person who is, or has been or is qualified to be, a 
High Court Judge or a person who is, or has been a member of the Indian Legal 
Service and who has held a post in Grade I of the Service for at least 3 years.  
The presiding office holds office for 5 years or until he attains the age of 65 
years, whichever is earlier.  
Any person aggrieved by ―any decision or order‖ of the Tribunal may appeal to 
the High Court, within 60 days. Jurisdiction of Civil Courts is barred, in respect of 
any matter which an adjudicating officer or the Cyber Appellate Tribunal has power 
to determine. 
15.  OFFENCES 
Chapter 11 of the Act, (Sections 65-78) deals with offences relating to 
computers etc. and connected matters. This Chapter also contains certain 
provisions empowering the Controller of Certifying Authorities to issue certain 
directions to certifying Authorities (Section 68) and to subscribers (Section 69). 
There is also a provision for confiscation. (Section 76) 
The offences listed in this Chapter are the following -  
 
(a) Tampering with computer source documents; 
 
(b) ―Hacking‖ with computer systems; (See below) 
 
(c) Publishing of obscene information in electronic form; 
 (d) Securing access to any computer, computer system or computer network 
declared by the appropriate Government to be a ―protected system‖; 
 (e) Misrepresentation about a material fact to, or suppression of a  material fact 
from, the Controller or the Certifying Authority; 
 
(f) Breach of confidentiality and privacy, by a person who has,  in the exercise 
of a power conferred by the Act, secured access to electronic  record, book, 
register etc.; 
 (g) Publishing a digital signature certificate, which is false in certain particulars; 
 (h) Knowing, creating, publishing etc. a Digital Signature Certificate, for any 
fraudulent or unlawful purpose. 
EP-GCL-7

Hacking 
Regarding hacking, Section 66 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, 
provides as under - 
Hacking with computer system 
 
(i) Whoever, with intent to cause, or knowing that he is likely  to cause, 
wrongful loss or damage to the public or any person, destroys or deletes or 
alters any information residing in a computer resource or diminishes its 
value or utility or affects it injuriously by any means, commits hacking. 
 (ii) Whoever commits hacking, shall be punished with imprisonment upto three 
years or with fine which may extend upto two lakh rupees or with both.

Correct Answer:  d 
 
Investigation 
Only a police officer of the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police is 
competent to investigate an offence under the Information Technology Act. 
Extraterritorial operation 
Extra-territorial operation of the Act is provided for, by enacting that the 
provisions of the Act apply to any offence or contravention committed outside India 
by any person, irrespective of his nationality, if the act or conduct in question 
involves a computer, computer system or computer network located in India. 
(Section 75) 
16.  LIABILITY OF NETWORK SERVICE PROVIDERS 
The Internet system depends, for its working, on network service providers- i.e. 
intermediaries. An ―intermediary‖, with respect to any particular electronic message, 
means any person who, on behalf of another person, receives, stores or transmits 
that message or provides any service with respect to that message. [Section 
2(1)(w)] 
In his capacity as an intermediary, a network service provider may have to 
handle matter which may contravene the Act. To avoid such a consequence, the 
Act declares that no network service provider shall be liable ―under this Act, rule or 
 
EP-GCL-7 
335 
regulation made thereunder‖, for any third party information or data made available 
by him, if he proves that the offence or contravention was committed without his 
knowledge or that he had exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of 
such offence or contravention. (Section 79) 
17.  DOMAIN NAMES 
It is vital, that prior to entering into any type of business activity, a company 
must be traceable relatively easily, on the Internet, i.e. it must have an address in 
cyber-space. This may be linked to a company having its Registered Office to 
which all communications are usually directed. This explains the utility of 
registration under a particular domain name and website. This has been made 
possible with the emergence of the Domain Name System (―DNS‖). Such 
registration would enable the company to conduct on-line transactions, as well as 
make it easily traceable by customers, suppliers, etc. 
18.  PASSING OFF 
The Information Technology Act does not contain a specific provision, declaring 
illegal any fraudulent use, by one person, of other persons domain name.  
However, even in the absence of specific legislation on the subject, such conduct 
can become actionable under the law of torts. In fact, judicial decisions, both in 
India and elsewhere, amply demonstrate the potency of the law of torts in this 
context. The tort of ―passing off‖ is wide enough to afford legal redress (in 
damages) to a person who is the holder of a particular domain name and who 
suffers harm as a result of the fraudulent use of his domain name by another 
person. Such conduct has been regarded as falling under the tort of ―passing off‖. 
The crux of the action of “passing off” lies in actual or possible 
or probable deception. The principles relating to “passing off” 
were held to be applicable to domain names in Rediff 
Communication Ltd. v. Cyberbooth, (2000) 1 Recent Arbitraton 
Judgements, 562 (Bombay High Court). 
The domain name “Rediff” (of the plaintiff) and the domain name “Rediff” (of 
the defendant) were held to be deceptively similar and capable of causing 
deception, as the fields of business activity of both the parties were similar. 
The grant of a temporary injunction, restraining the defendant from using the 
name in question, was held to be proper. 
A similar view has been taken in Yahoo Inc. v. Akash Arora, (1999) 2 Recent 
Arbitration Judgements, 176 (Delhi). The plaintiff’s domain name was 
“Yahoo”. The defendant’s domain name was “Yahoo India”. The two were 
held to be similar, even though the defendants had suffixed the word “India”. 
It was held that, even if a user of Internet is a sophisticated user, he may be 
an unsophisticated consumer of information and he may unintentionally find 
his way to a different Internet size. In this manner, confusion could be 
created.

LESSON ROUND-UP 
 
 
The Information Technology Act has been passed to give effect to the UN 
resolution and to promote efficient delivery of Government services by means of 
reliable electronic records. The Act came into effect on 17.10.2000. 
 
The purpose of the Act is (a) to provide legal recognition for transactions carried 
out by means of electronic data interchange and other means of electronic 
communication, commonly referred to as ―electronic commerce‖, which involve 
the use of alternatives to paper-based methods of communication and storage of 
information and (b) to facilitate electronic filing of documents with the 
Government agencies. 
 
Any subscriber may authenticate an electronic record by affixing his digital 
signature. 
 
―Digital Signature‖ means authentication of any electronic record by a subscriber 
by means of an electronic method or procedure in accordance with the provisions 
of Section 3 of the Act. 
 
Any person by the use of a public key of the subscriber can verify the electronic 
record. The private key and the public key are unique to the subscriber and 
constitute a functioning key pair. 
 
Where any law provides that information or any other matter shall be 
authenticated by affixing the signature or any document shall be signed or bear 
the signature of any person then, notwithstanding anything contained in such law, 
such requirement shall be deemed to have been satisfied, if such information or 
matter is authenticated by means of digital signature affixed in such manner as 
may be prescribed by the Central Government. 
 
The digital signature will be certified by ‗Certifying Authority‘. The ‗certified 
authority‘ will be licensed, supervised and controlled by ‗Controller of Certifying 
Authorities‘. 
 
The Act contemplates a dual scheme in regard to wrongful acts concerning 
computers, etc. Certain acts are visited with (so called) ―penalties‖, which are 
however, adjudicated, not before courts, but before adjudication officers. 
 
EP-GCL-7 
337 
 
The Act provides for the establishment of one or more Cyber Regulations

STUDY VIII 
THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE, 1908 (C.P.C.) 
  
 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Laws can be divided into two groups: (i) substantive law; and (ii) procedural law. 
Whereas substantive law determines rights and liabilities of parties, procedural or 
adjective law prescribes practice, procedure and machinery for the enforcement of 
those rights and liabilities. Procedural law is thus an adjunct or an accessory to 
substantive law. The Code of Civil Procedure is an adjective law it neither creates nor 
takes away any right. It is intended to regulate the procedure to be followed by civil 
courts. 
The students need to be familiar with the essentials of the basic procedural laws of 
the country. It is necessary for them to keep in view the requirement of the procedural 
law in handling of corporate business, even in initial stages or later, which could have 
legal implications at some subsequent stage.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
The Company Secretary and the Secretarial Staff of a Company need to be 
familiar with the essentials of the basic procedural laws of the country. While the 
specific corporate, industrial, taxation, property and urban land laws have direct 
relevance for the efficient performance of the duties and responsibilities of the 
Company Secretary, the procedural law also provides the parameters for the 
pursuance of legal action. It is also therefore necessary to keep in view the 
338 
 
EP-GCL-8 
339 
? 
requirement of the procedural law, or as such law is often termed "adjective law", in 
the handling of corporate business, even in initial stages or later, which could have 
legal implications at some subsequent stage. Such monitoring and guidance is 
required to be rendered by the Company Secretary and other Secretarial Executives 
to the line management for safeguarding the interests of the company. It has been 
endeavoured in this Chapter to summarise one of such aspects of Indian procedural 
laws which have to be referred to by the Company Secretaries. 
2.  AIM AND SCOPE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE CODE, 1908 [C.P.C.] 
The Civil Procedure Code consolidates and amends the law relating to the 
procedure of the Courts of Civil jurisdiction. The Code does not affect any special or 
local laws nor does it supersede any special jurisdiction or power conferred or any 
special form of procedure prescribed by or under any other law for the time being in 
force. The Code is the general law so that in case of conflict between the Code and 
the special law the latter prevails over the former. Where the special law is silent on a 
particular matter the Code applies, but consistent with the special enactment. Thus it 
is seen for instance, that the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 
and the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission Regulations, 1991 
(Regulations 62, 64 etc.) have adopted various relevant provisions of the Code, while 
the provisions of the Code are not applicable for Regulation 50, 65 etc. Similarly the 
Companies (Bench) Rules also lay down the special procedure for proceedings of the 
company law cases. 
3.  SCHEME OF THE CODE 
The Civil Procedure Code  consists  of  two  parts.  158 Sections form the first 
part and the rules and orders contained in Schedule I form the second part. The 
object of the Code generally is to create jurisdiction while the rules indicate the mode 
in which the jurisdiction should be exercised. Thus the two parts should be read 
together, and in case of any conflict between the body and the rules, the former must 
prevail.

4.  SOME IMPORTANT TERMS 
Cause of Action 
"Cause of action" means every fact that it would be necessary for the plaintiff to 
prove in order to support his right to the judgement of  the Court.  Under  Order 2, 
EP-GCL-8 
340 
Rule 2, of the Civil Procedure Code it means all the essential facts constituting the 
rights and its infringement. It means every fact which will be necessary for the plaintiff 
to prove, if traversed in order to support his right to the judgement. 
Judgement, Decree and Order  
"Judgement" as defined in Section 2(9) of the Civil Procedure Code means the 
statement given by the Judge on the grounds of a decree or order. Thus a judgement 
must set out the grounds and reasons for the Judge to have arrived at the decision. 
In other words, a "judgement" is the decision of a Court of justice upon the 
respective rights and claims of the parties to an action in a suit submitted to it 
for determination (State of Tamilnadu v. S. Thangaval, AIR (1997) S.C. 2283). 
"Decree" is defined in Section 2(2) of the Code as (i) the formal expression of an 
adjudication which, so far as regards the Court expressing it; (ii) conclusively; (iii) 
determines the rights of the parties; (iv) with regard to all or any of the matters in 
controversy; (v) in the suit and may be either preliminary (i.e. when further 
proceedings have to be taken before disposal of the suit) or final. 
But decree does not include: 
 (a) any adjudication from which an appeal lies as an appeal from an Order, or 
 (b) any order of dismissal for default. 
Essentials of a decree are: 
 
(i) There must be a formal expression of adjudication; 
 (ii) There must be a conclusive determination of the rights of parties; 
 (iii) The determination must be with regard to or any of the matters in 
contravention in the suit; 
 (iv) The adjudication should have been given in the suit. 
According to the explanation to the definition, a decree may be partly preliminary 
and partly final. A decree comes into existence as soon as the judgement is 
pronounced and not on the date when it is sealed and signed. (Order 20 Rule 7) 
A decree is preliminary when further proceedings have to be taken before the suit 
can be completely disposed of. The preliminary decree is not dependent on the final. 
On the other hand, final decree is dependent and subordinate to the preliminary 
decree, and gives effect to it. The preliminary decree ascertains what is to be done 
while the final decree states the result achieved by means of the preliminary decree. 
If the preliminary decree is set aside the final decree is automatically superseded. 
Decree-holder 
"Decree-holder" means any person in whose favour a decree has been passed or 
an order capable of execution has been made. [Section 2(3)] Thus, a person who is 
not a party to the suit but in whose favour an order capable of execution is passed is 
a decree-holder. 
Judgement-debtor 
"Judgement-debtor" means any person against whom a decree has been passed 
or an order capable of execution has been made. [Section 2(10)] The definition does 
not include legal representative of a deceased judgement-debtor. 
 
EP-GCL-8 
341 
Judgement 
The "judgement" means a statement given by a judge on the grounds of a decree 
or order [Section 2(9)]. What is ordinarily called as an order is in fact a judgement. 
Also an order deciding a primary issue is a judgement. 
Order 
"Order" as set out in Section 2(14) of the Code means the formal expression of 
any decision of a Civil Court which is not a decree. 
According to Section 104 of the Code, no appeal lies against orders other than 
what is expressly provided in the Code or any other law for the time being in force. 
Under the Code appealable orders are: 
 
(i) an order under Section 35A, i.e. for compensatory costs in respect of false or 
vexatious claims within pecuniary jurisdiction of the Court, but only for the 
limited ground that no order should have been made, or that such order 
should have been made for a lesser amount. 
 (ii) an order under Section 91 or Section 92 refusing leave to institute a suit 
under Section 91 (Public nuisances and other wrongful acts affecting the 
public) or Section 92 (alleged breach of trust created for public purposes of a 
charitable or religious nature). 
 (iii) an order under Section 95, i.e. compensation for obtaining arrest attachment 
or injunction on insufficient grounds. 
 (iv) an order under any of the provisions of the Code imposing a fine or directing 
the arrest or detention in the civil prison of any person except where such 
arrest or detention is in execution of a decree. 
 (v) any order made under rules from which an appeal is expressly allowed by the 
rules. 
No appeal lies from any order passed in appeal under this section. 
In the case of other orders, no appeal lies except where a decree is appealed 
from, any error, defect or irregularity in any order affecting the decision of the case 
which is to be set forth as a ground of objection in the memorandum of appeal. 
A decree, shall be deemed to include the rejection of a plaint but not any 
adjudication from which an appeal lies or any order of dismissal for default. A 
preliminary decree decides the rights of parties on all or any of the matters in 
controversy in the suit but does not completely dispose of the suit. A preliminary 
decree may be appealed against and does not lose its appellate character by reason 
of a final decree having been passed before the appeal is presented. The Court may, 
on the application of any party to a suit, pass orders on different applications and any 
order which is not the final order in a suit is called an “interlocutory order”. An 
interlocutory order does not dispose of the suit but is merely a direction to procedure. 
It reserves some questions for further determination. 
The main difference between an order and a decree is that when in an 
adjudication which is a decree appeal lies and second appeal also lies on the 
grounds mentioned in Section 100 of CPC. However, no appeal lies from an order 
unless it is expressly provided under Section 104 and Order 43 Rule 1. No second 
EP-GCL-8 
342 
? 
appeal in any case lies at all even in case of appealable orders. [Section 104(2)] A 
decree conclusively determines the rights and liabilities of the parties with regard to 
all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit and may be either preliminary or 
final but this is not the case in order. 
A person in whose favour a decree has been passed not only includes a plaintiff 
but in cases like decree for specific performance of an agreement executable by 
either party, also includes a defendant.

 (d) All the above 
Correct answer: (d) 
 
5.  STRUCTURE OF CIVIL COURTS 
Section 3 of the Civil Procedure Code lays down that for the purposes of this 
Code, the District Court is subordinate to the High Court and every Civil Court of a 
grade inferior to that of a District and every Court of small causes is subordinate to 
the High Court and District Court. 
6.  JURISDICTION OF COURTS AND VENUE OF SUITS 
Jurisdiction means the authority by which a Court has to decide 
matters that are brought before it for adjudication. The limit of this 
authority is imposed by charter, statute or a commission. If no such 
limit is imposed or defined, the jurisdiction is said to be unlimited. A 
limitation on jurisdiction of a Civil Court may be of four kinds. These are as follows :- 
(i)  jurisdiction over the subject matter 
The jurisdiction to try certain matters by certain Court is limited by statute; e.g. a 
small cause court can try suits for money due under a promissory note or a suit for 
price of work done. 
(ii)  Place of suing or territorial jurisdiction 
A territorial limit of jurisdiction for each court is fixed by the Government. Thus, it 
can try matters falling within the territorial limits of its jurisdiction. 
(iii)  Jurisdiction over persons 
All persons of whatever nationality are subject to the jurisdiction of the Civil 
Courts of the country except a foreign State, it‟s Ruler or its representative except 
with the consent of Central Government. 
 
EP-GCL-8 
343 
(iv)  Pecuniary jurisdiction depending on pecuniary value of the suit 
Section 6 deal with Pecuniary jurisdiction and lays down that save in so far as is 
otherwise expressly provided Courts shall only have jurisdiction over suits the amount 
or value of which does not exceed the pecuniary limits of any of its ordinary 
jurisdiction. There is no limit on pecuniary jurisdiction of High Courts and District 
Courts. 
Jurisdiction may be further classified into following categories depending upon 
their powers: 
 
(i) Original Jurisdiction — A Court tries and decides suits filed before it. 
 (ii) Appellate Jurisdiction — A Court hears appeals against decisions or decrees 
passed by sub-ordinate Courts. 
 (iii) Original and appellate Jurisdiction — The Supreme Court, the High Courts 
and the District Courts have both original and appellate jurisdiction in various 
matters. 
Courts to try all civil suits unless barred : Section 9 of Civil Procedure Code 
states that the Courts shall have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature excepting 
suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred. The 
explanation appended to the Section provides that a suit in which the right to property 
or to an office is contested is a suit of civil nature, notwithstanding that such right may 
depend entirely on the decision on questions as a religious rites or ceremonies. 
Civil Courts have jurisdiction to entertain a suit of civil nature unless barred by 
law. Every person has an inherent right to bring a suit of a 
civil nature. Civil Court has jurisdiction to decide the 
question of its jurisdiction although as a result of the 
enquiry it may be found that it has no jurisdiction over the 
matter. Jurisdiction depends not on the truth or falsehood 
of facts, but upon their nature. Jurisdiction is determinable 
at the commencement not at the conclusion of the inquiry 
(Rex v. Boltan, (1841) 1 QB 66, 74). 
A suit is expressly barred if a legislation expressly says so and it is impliedly 
barred if a statute creates new right or liability and prescribes a particular tribunal or 
forum for its assertion. When a right is created by a statute and a special tribunal or 
forum is provided for its assertion and enforcement, the ordinary Civil Court would 
have no jurisdiction to entertain such disputes. 
7.  STAY OF SUIT (DOCTRINE OF RES SUB JUDICE) 
Section 10 provides that no Court shall proceed with the trial of any suit in which 
the matter in issue is also directly and substantially in issue in a previously instituted 
suit between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them 
claim, litigating under the same title, where such suit is pending in the same or any 
other Court (in India) having jurisdiction to grant the relief claimed, or in any Court 
beyond the limits of India established or continued by the Central Government and 
having like jurisdiction, or before the Supreme Court. 
However, the pendency of a suit in a foreign court does not preclude the Courts 
in India from trying a suit founded on the same cause of action. 
EP-GCL-8 
344 
To prevent Courts of concurrent jurisdiction from simultaneously trying two 
parallel suits in respect of same matter in issue, Section 10 is enacted. The purpose 
is also to avoid conflict of decision. It is really intended to give effect to the rule of res 
judicata. The institution of second suit is not barred by Section 10. It merely says that 
the trial cannot be proceeded with. 
A suit was instituted by the plaintiff company alleging infringement by the 
defendant company by using trade name of medicine and selling the same in 
wrapper and carton of identical design with same colour 
combination etc. as that of plaintiff company. A subsequent 
suit was instituted in different Court by the defendant 
company 
against 
the 
plaintiff 
company 
with 
same 
allegation. The Court held that subsequent suit should be 
stayed as simultaneous trial of the suits in different Courts 
might result in conflicting decisions as issue involved in 
two suits was totally identical (M/s. Wings Pharmaceuticals (P) Ltd. and another 
v. M/s. Swan Pharmaceuticals and others, AIR 1999 Pat. 96). 
Even though if a case is not governed by the provisions of the Section and 
matters in issue may not be identical, yet the courts have inherent powers to stay suit 
on principle analogous to Section 10. 
Essential conditions for stay of suits 
 
(i) There must be two suits instituted at different times; 
 (ii) The matter in issue in the later suit should be directly and substantially in 
issue in the earlier suit; 
 (iii) Such suit should be between the same parties; 
 (iv) Such earlier suit is still pending either in the same Court or in any other 
competent Court but not before a foreign Court. 
If these conditions exist, the later suit should be stayed till the disposal of earlier 
suit, the findings of which operate as res judicata on the later suit. 
For the applicability of Section 10, the two proceedings must be suits e.g. suit for 
eviction of tenant in a rent control statute cannot be sought to be stayed under 
Section 10 of Civil Procedure Code on the ground that tenant has earlier filed a suit 
for specific performance against the landlord on the basis of agreement of sale of 
disputed premises in favour of the tenant. 
In such a case, it cannot be said that the matter in earlier suit for specific 
performance is directly and substantially in issue in later suit for eviction. The reason 
is that a suit for specific performance of contract has got nothing to do with the 
question regarding the relationship of landlord and tenant. 
Regarding the inherent powers under Section 151, these would also not be used 
for staying the eviction suit as the same would frustrate the very purpose of the 
legislation. Therefore, invoking the powers of the Court under this Section, on the 
facts and circumstances of the case amounts to an abuse of the process of the Court 
and there can be no doubt that such a course cannot be said to subserve the ends of 
the justice (N.P. Tripathi v. Dayamanti Devi, AIR 1988 Pat. 123).

Correct answer: (b) 
 
8.  PLACE OF SUING (TERRITORIAL) 
Section 15 lays down that every suit shall be instituted in the Court of the lowest 
grade to try it. 
According to Section 16, subject to the pecuniary or other limitations prescribed 
by any law, the following suits (relating to property) shall be instituted in the Court 
within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the property is situated : 
 (a) for recovery of immovable property with or without rent or profits; 
 (b) for partition of immovable property; 
 (c) for foreclosure of sale or redemption in the case of a mortgage or charge 
upon immovable property; 
 (d) for the determination of any other right to or interest in immovable property; 
 (e) for compensation for wrong to immovable property; 
 
(f) for the recovery of movable property actually distraint or attachment. 
It has also been provided by a proviso that where relief could be obtained 
through personal obedience of the defendant such suit to obtain relief for 
compensation or respecting immovable property can be instituted either in a local 
Court within whose local limits of jurisdiction the property is situated or in the Court 
within whose local limits of jurisdiction the defendant voluntarily resides or carries on 
business or personally works for gain. 
According to the Explanation, "property" means property situated in India. 
Where immovable property is situated within the jurisdiction of different Courts: 
Where the jurisdiction for a suit is to obtain relief respecting, or compensation for 
wrong to immovable property situated within the local limits of jurisdiction of different 
Courts, the suit may be instituted in any Court within the local limits of whose 
jurisdiction the property is situated provided the value of the entire claim is cognisable 
by such Court. (Section 17) 
Where local limits of jurisdiction of Courts are uncertain: Where jurisdiction is 
alleged to be uncertain as being within the local limits of the jurisdiction of which of 
EP-GCL-8 
346 
two or more Courts, any immovable property is situated, then any of the said Courts 
may proceed to entertain the suit after having recorded a statement to the effect that 
it is satisfied that there is ground for such alleged uncertainty. (Section 18) 
Where wrong done to the person or to movable property : Where a suit is for 
compensation for wrong done to the person or to movable property, if the wrong was 
done within the local limits of the jurisdiction of one Court and the defendant resides, 
or carries on business, or personally works for gain, within the local limits of the 
jurisdiction of another Court, the suit may be instituted at the option of the plaintiff in 
either of the Courts. (Section 19) 
Other suits: Other suits to be instituted where defendants reside or cause of 
action arises, subject to the limitations provided by Sections 15, 16, 18 and 19, every 
suit shall be instituted in a Court within local limits of whose jurisdiction the defendant, 
or each of the defendants (where there are more than one defendant) actually and 
voluntarily resides or carries on business or personally works for gain or where such 
defendants actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or personally works 
for gain, provided either the leave of the Court is obtained or the defendant(s) who do 
not reside or carry on business or personally work for gain at such place acquisce in 
such institution or, where the cause of action arises, wholly or in part. (Section 20) 
In the case of a body corporate or company it shall be deemed to carry on 
business at its sole or principal office in India, or in case of any cause of action 
arising at any other place, if it has a subordinate office, at such place. 
Where there might be two or more competent courts which could entertain 
a suit consequent upon a part of cause of action having arisen therewith if 
the parties to the contract agreed to vest jurisdiction in one such court to 
try the dispute. Such an agreement would be valid (Angile Insulations v. 
Davy Ashmore India Ltd., (1995) 3 SCALE 203). 
9.  RES JUDICATA 
Section 11 of the Civil Procedure Code deals with the doctrine of Res Judicata 
that is, bar or restraint on repetition of litigation of the same issues. It is a pragmatic 
principle accepted and provided in law that there must be a limit or end to litigation on 
the same issues. 
The doctrine underlines the general principle that no one shall be 
twice vexed for the same cause (S.B. Temple v. V.V.B. Charyulu, 
(1971) 1 SCJ 215). The doctrine of res judicata prevails over the 
doctrine of lis pendens where there is a conflict between the two. 
It prevents two different decrees on the same subject. Section 11 says that once 
a res is judicata, it shall not be adjudged again. The principle applies to suits in 
Section 11 of the Code; but even where Section 11 does not apply, the principle of 
res judicata has been applied by Courts for the purpose of giving finality to litigation. 
For the applicability of the principle of res judicata embodied in Section 11, the 
following requirements are necessary: 
(1)  The matter directly and substantially in issue in former suit shall also be 
directly and substantially in issue in later suit. 
 
EP-GCL-8 
347 
The expression “directly and substantially in issue” means an issue alleged 
by one party and denied or admitted by the another either expressly or by 
necessary implications (Lonakutty v. Thomman, AIR 1976 SC 1645). 
In the matter of taxation for levy of Municipal taxes, there is no question of res 
judicata as each year‟s assessment is final for that year and does not govern latter 
years (Municipal Corporation v. Madan Mohan, AIR 1976 43). 
A suit for eviction on reasonable requirement was compromised and the tenant 
was allowed to continue as tenant for the subsequent suit for ejectment on the 
ground of reasonable requirement, it was found that some reasonable requirement 
had been present during the earlier suit. The second suit was not maintainable. 
(2) The former suit has been decided—former suit means which is decided 
earlier. 
(3)  The said issue has been heard and finally decided. 
The issue or the suit itself is heard and finally decided, then it operates as res 
judicata and is not the reasons leading to the decision (Mysore State E. Board v. 
Bangalore W.C. & S. Mills, AIR 1963 SC 1128). However, no res judicata operates 
when the points could not have been raised in earlier suit. (See Prafulla Chandra v. 
Surat Roit AIR 1998 Ori. 41). But when a suit has been decided on merits, and the 
appeal is dismissed on a preliminary point, it amounts to the appeal being heard and 
finally decided and the decision operates as res judicata (Mukunda Jana v. Kanta 
Mandal, AIR 1979 NOC 116). 
(4)  Such former suit and the latter are between the same parties or litigation 
under the same title or persons claiming under parties above (Isher Singh v. Sarwan 
Singh, AIR 1965 SC 948). 
In short, this principle applies where an issue which has 
been raised in a subsequent suit was directly and 
substantially in issue in a former suit between the same 
parties and was heard and decided finally. Findings 
incidentally recorded do not operate as res judicata 
(Madhvi Amma Bhawani Amma v. Kunjikutty P.M. Pillai, AIR 
2000 SC 2301). 
Supreme Court in Gouri Naidu v. Thandrothu Bodemma and others, AIR 1997 
SC 808, held that the law is well settled that even if erroneous, an inter party 
judgement binds the party if the court of competent jurisdiction has decided the lis. 
Thus, a decision that a gift made by a coparceners is invalid under Hindu Law 
between coparceners, binds the parties when the same question is in issue in a 
subsequent suit between the same parties for partition. 
A consent or compromise decree is not a decision by Court. It is an acceptance 
of something to which the parties had agreed. The Court does not decide anything. 
The compromise degree merely has the seal of the Court on the agreement of the 
parties. As such, the principle of res judicata does not generally apply to a consent or 
compromise decree. But when the court on the facts proved comes to a conclusion 
that the parties intended that the consent decree should have the effect of deciding 
the question finally, the principle of res judicata may apply to it. 
The rule of res sub judice relates to a matter which is pending judicial enquiry 
EP-GCL-8 
348 
? 
while res Judicata relates to a matter adjudicated upon or a matter on which 
judgement has been pronounced. Res sub judice bars the trial of a suit in which the 
matter directly or substantially is pending adjudication in a previous suit, whereas rule 
of res judicata bars the trial of a suit of an issue in which the matter directly and 
substantially in issue has already been adjudicated upon in a previous suit between 
the same parties under the same title. Res Judicata arises out of considerations of 
public policy viz., that there should be an end to litigation on the same matter. Res-
Judicata presumes conclusively the truth of the former decision and ousts the 
jurisdiction of the Court to try the case. It is however essential that the matter directly 
and substantially in issue must be the same as in the former suit and not matters 
collaterally or incidentally in issue. 
An application for amendment of a decree is not a „suit‟ and may be entertained. 
But if such an application is heard and finally decided, then it will debar a subsequent 
application on general principles of law analogous to res judicata. However, dismissal 
of a suit for default, where there has been no adjudication on the merits of the 
application, will not operate as res judicata. Similarly an application for a review of 
judgment if refused does not bar a subsequent suit for the same relief on the same 
grounds. In the case of conflicting decrees, the last decree alone is the effective 
decree which can operate as res judicata. 
According to this provision of the Civil Procedure Code, no Court shall try any suit 
or issue in which the matter has been directly and substantially in issue in a former 
suit (i.e. suit previously decided) either between the same parties, or between parties 
under whom they or any of them claim, litigating under the same title in a Court 
competent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been 
subsequently raised an finally decided by such Court. 
According to Explanation to the Section, the expression „former‟ suit has been set 
out as stated above. The competence of a Court to decide an issue or suit is to be 
determined irrespective of any provisions as to a right of appeal from the decision of 
such Court. It is stated in Explanation III that the matter must have been alleged by 
one party and either denied or admitted expressly or impliedly by the other. 
Explanation IV any matter which might or ought to have been made a ground of 
defence or attack in such former suit shall be deemed to have been a matter directly 
and substantially in issue in such (former) suit.

defence or attack in a former suit) as earlier referred to. This doctrine is based on the 
following grounds of public policy: 
 
(i) There should be an end to litigation; 
 (ii) The parties to a suit should not be harassed to agitate the same issues or 
matters already decided between them;

been and should have been decided in the former suit between the parties; 
 (iv) It is a rule of convenience and not a rule of absolute justice. 
Explanation V states that any relief claimed in the plaint but not expressly granted 
shall be deemed to have been refused. By Explanation VI it is provided that in the 
case of a representation suit or class of action all persons interested in any public or 
private right claimed in common for themselves and others are to be deemed to claim 
under the persons so litigating and res judicata shall apply to them. 
Explanations VII and VIII have been added by the Amendment Act of 1976. 
Explanation VII specifically lays down that the principles of res judicata apply to 
execution proceedings. The general pinciples of res judicata have been recognised in 
Explanation VIII. It provides that the decisions of a “Court of limited jurisdiction 
competent to decide such issue” operates as res judicata in a subsequent suit though 
the former Court had no jurisdiction to try the subsequent suit. The general principle 
of res judicata is wider in scope than Section 11 which is applied when a case does 
not come within four corners of Section 11. However, when the case falls under 
Section 11 but the conditions are not fulfilled, the general principles of res judicata 
cannot be resorted to. The conditions may be summarised as follows : 
Conditions of res judicata 
 
1. The matter must be directly and substantially in issue in two suits; 
 
2. The prior suit should be between the same parties or persons claiming under 
them; 
 
3. The parties should have litigated under the same title; 
 
4. The court which determined the earlier suit must be competent to try the 
latter suit; 
 
5. The same question is directly and substantially in issue in the latter suit. 
Bar to further suit 
Section 12 puts a bar to every suit where a plaintiff is precluded by rules from 
instituting a further suit in respect of any particular cause of action. Section comes 
into force only when a plaintiff is precluded by rules.

10.  SET-OFF COUNTER-CLAIM AND EQUITABLE SET-OFF 
Set-off 
Order 8, Rule 6 deals with set-off which is a reciprocal acquittal of debts between 
the plaintiff and defendant. It has the effect of extinguishing the plaintiff‟s claim to the 
extent of the amount claimed by the defendant as a counter claim. 
Under Order VIII Rule 6 where in a suit for the recovery of money the defendant 
claims to set off against the plaintiff‟s demand any ascertained sum of money legally 
recoverable by him from the plaintiff not exceeding the pecuniary jurisdiction of the 
Court and where both parties fill the same character as in the plaintiff‟s suit, the 
defendant may, at the first hearing of the suit, but not afterwords unless permitted by 
the Court, present a written statement containing the particulars of the debt sought to 
be set-off. 
Effect of Set-off 
Under clause (2) the written statement shall have the same effect as a plaint in a 
cross-suit so as to enable the Court to pronounce a final judgement in respect both of 
the original claim and of the set-off, but this shall not affect the lien, upon the amount 
decreed, of any pleader in respect of the costs payable to him under the decree. 
Counter-claim 
A defendant in a suit may, in addition to his right of pleading a set-off under Rule 
6, set up by way of counter-claim against the claim of the plaintiff, any right or claim in 
respect of a cause of action accruing to the defendant against the plaintiff either 
before or after the filling of the suit but before the defendant has delivered his 
defence or before the time limited for delivering his defence has expired, whether 
such counter-claim is in the nature of claim for damages or not. Such counter-claim 
must be within the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Court. (Order 8, Rule 6A) 
Equitable set-off 
Sometimes, the defendant is permitted to claim set-off in respect of an 
unascertained sum of money where the claim arises out of the same transaction, or 
transactions which can be considered as one transaction, or where there is 
knowledge on both sides of an existing debt due to one party and a credit by the 
other party found on and trusting to such debt as a means of discharging it. Generally 
the suits emerge from cross-demands in the same transaction and this doctrine is 
intended to save the defendant from having to take recourse to a separate cross-suit. 
In India distinction between legal and equitable set-off is recognised. Order 8, 
Rule 6 contains provisions as to legal set-off. Order 8, Rule 6A recognises the 
counter-claim by the defendant still an equitable set-off can be claimed independently 
of the Code. The Common Law Courts in England do not recognise equitable claims. 
11.  TEMPORARY INJUNCTIONS AND INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS 
Temporary injunction 
The Court may grant temporary injunction to restrain any such act (as set out 
below) or make such other order for the purpose of staying and preventing the 
wasting, damaging, alienation or sale or removal or disposition of the property or 
 
EP-GCL-8 
351 
? 
dispossession of the plaintiff, or otherwise causing injury to the plaintiff in relation to 
any property in dispute in the suit; where it is proved by affidavit or otherwise: 
 (a) that any property in dispute in a suit is in danger of being wasted, damaged 
or alienated by any party to the suit, or wrongfully sold in execution of a 
decree, or 
 (b) that the defendant threatens, or intends to remove or dispose of his property 
with a view to defrauding his creditors, or 
 (c) that the defendant threatens to dispossess the plaintiff or otherwise cause 
injury to the plaintiff in relation to any property in dispute in the suit. 
It would be necessary for the plaintiff to satisfy the Court that substantial and 
irreparable harm or injury would be suffered by him if such temporary injunction (till 
the disposal of the suit) is not granted and that such loss or damage or harm cannot 
be compensated by damages. (Order XXXIX) 
Interlocutory orders 
Power to order interim sale 
The Court may, on the application of any party to a suit order the sale, by any 
person named in such order, and in such manner and on such terms as it thinks fit, of 
any movable property, being the subject-matter of such suit, or attached before 
judgement in such suit, which is subject to speedy and natural decay, or which for 
any other just and sufficient cause it may be desirable to be sold at once. (Rule 6)

12. 
DETENTION, PRESERVATION, INSPECTION ETC. OF SUBJECT-MATTER 
OF SUIT 
The Court may, on application of any party to a suit, and on such terms as it 
thinks fit: 
 (a) make an order for the detention, preservation or inspection of any property 
which is the subject-matter of such suit or as to which any question may arise 
therein; 
 (b) for all or any of the purposes as in (a) above, authorise any person to enter 
upon or into any land or building in the possession of any other party to such 
suit; and 
 (c) for all or any of the purpose as in (a) above authorise any samples to be 
taken, or any observation to be made or experiment to be tried, which may 
EP-GCL-8 
352 
seem necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining full information or 
evidence. (Rule 7) 
Application for such order to be after notice— 
 (1) An application by the plaintiff for an order under Rule 6 or Rule 7 may be 
made at any time after institution of the suit. 
 (2) An application by the defendant for such an order may be made at any time 
after appearance. 
 (3) Before making an order under Rule 6 or Rule 7 on an application made for 
the purpose, the Court shall, except where it appears that the object of 
making such order would be defeated by the delay, direct notice thereof to be 
given to the opposite party. 
Deposit of money etc. in the Court 
Where the subject-matter of a suit is money or some other thing capable of 
delivery, and any party thereto admits that he holds such money or other thing as a 
trustee for another party, or that it belongs or is due to another party, the Court may 
order the same to be deposited in Court or delivered to such last-named party, with or 
without security subject to further direction of the Court. Rule (10) 
In any suit for restraining the defendant from committing a breach of contract or 
other injury of any kind, whether compensation is claimed or not, the plaintiff may, at 
any time after the commencement of the suit, and either before or after judgement, 
apply to the court for a temporary injunction to restrain the defendant from committing 
the breach of contract or injury complained of, or any breach of contract or injury of a 
like nature arising out of the same contract or relating to the same property or right. 
The Court may grant an injunction on such terms including keeping of an account and 
furnishing security etc. as it may think fit. 
The grant of a temporary injunction is a matter of discretion of Courts. Such 
injunction may be granted if the Court finds that there is a substantial question to be 
investigated and that matter should be preserved in status until final disposal of that 
question. In granting injunction, the Court has to see the balance of convenience and 
inconvenience of both sides. If the object of granting a temporary injunction is liable 
to be defeated by the delay, the Court while passing an order granting interim or 
temporary injunction, has a notice served on the defendant to show cause why the 
order granting the interim injunction should not be confirmed. On hearing the 
objection of the defendant to such injunction, the Court either confirms the interim 
injunction or cancels the order of injunction. 
13.  INSTITUTION OF SUIT 
Suit ordinarily is a civil action started by presenting a plaint in duplicate to the 
Court containing concise statement of the material facts, on which the party pleading 
relies for his claim or defence. In every plaint the facts must be proved by an affidavit. 
The main essentials of the suit are— 
 
(a) the opposing parties, 
 
(b) the cause of action, 
 
EP-GCL-8 
353 
 (c) the subject matter of the suit, and 
 (d) the relief(s) claimed. 
The plaint consists of a heading and title, the body of plaint and the relief(s) 
claimed. Every suit shall be instituted in the Court of the lowest grade competent to 
try it, as to be determined with regard to the subject matter being either immovable or 
movable property or to the place of abode or of business or the defendant. A suit for 
a tort may be brought either where the wrong was committed or where the defendant 
resides or carries on business. A suit for a breach of contract may be instituted in a 
Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the defendant or each of the 
defendants (where there are more than one) at the time of commencement of the suit 
actually or voluntarily resides or carries on business or personally works for gain, or 
where any of the defendants so resides or works for gain or carries on business 
provided the leave of the Court is given or that the other defendants acquiesce in 
such situation. A suit for breach of contract may also be instituted where the cause of 
action arises that is, where the contract was made or where the breach was 
committed. A suit for recovery of immovable property can be instituted in a Court 
within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the property or any property of it is situate. 
Claim for recovery of any immovable property could be for (a) mesne profits or 
arrear‟s of rent, (b) damages for breach of contract under which the property or any 
part thereof is held and (c) claims in which the relief sought is based on the same 
cause of action. 
Where a plaintiff omits to sue in respect of or intentionally relinquishes any 
portion of his claim, he shall not afterwards sue in respect of the portion so omitted or 
relinquished. 
Regarding other suits, they shall be instituted in a Court within the local limits of 
whose jurisdiction: 
 (a) the defendant or each of the defendants if there are more than one at the 
time of the commencement of the suit actually or voluntarily resides or carries 
on business or personally works for gain or 
 (b) any of the defendants, where there are more than one at the time of the 
commencement of the suit, actually or voluntarily resides, or carries on 
business, or personally works for gain, provided that in such case either the 
leave of the Court is given or the defendants who do not reside or carry on 
business, or personally work for gain, as aforesaid, acquiesce in such 
institution; or 
 (c) the cause of action wholly or in part arises. 
Misjoinder of Parties — Where more than one persons joined in one suit as 
plaintiffs  or  defendants  in  whom  or  against  whom  any  right to relief does not 
arise or against whom separate suits are brought, no common question of law or fact 
would arise, it is a case of „misjoinder of parties‟. To avoid such misjoinder, two 
factors are essential viz. (i) the right to relief must arise out of the same act or 
transaction brought by the plaintiffs or against the defendants, (ii) there is a common 
question of law or fact. The Code does not require that all the questions of law or of 
fact should be common to all the parties. It is sufficient that if there is one common 
question. 
EP-GCL-8 
354 
? 
"Cause of action" means every fact which, if traversed, would be necessary for 
the plaintiff to prove in order to support his right to the judgement of the Court. Thus, 
cause of action is a bundle of essential facts which the plaintiff has to prove in order 
to sustain his action. The cause of action must be antecedent to the institution of the 
suit. It consists of two factors (a) a right, and (b) an infringement for which relief is 
claimed. 
Every breach of contract gives rise to a cause of action and a suit may be 
instituted to secure the proper relief in the place— 
 (a) where the contract was made, or 
 (b) where the breach has occurred, or 
 (c) the place where money is payable. 
The place of breach is the place where the contract had to be performed or 
completed. 
Where the place of payment is not specified, it is to be ascertained with reference 
to the intention of the parties and the circumstances of each case. 
Misjoinder of Causes of Action — If the plaintiffs are not jointly interested in all 
the causes of action there is misjoinder of causes of action. 
All objections regarding misjoinder of parties or of cause of action should be 
taken at the first hearing of the suit and before the settlement of causes unless the 
ground for objections had subsequently arisen.

14.  IMPORTANT STAGES IN PROCEEDINGS OF A SUIT 
When the suit has been duly instituted, the Court issues an order (known as 
summons) to the defendant to appear and answer the claim and to file the written 
statement of his defence if any within a period of 30 days from the date of service of 
summons. No summons are to be issued when the defendant has appeared at the 
presentation of plaint and admitted the plaintiffs claim. 
If the defendant fails to file the written statement within the prescribed 
period of 30 days, he is allowed to file the same on such other days as 
 
EP-GCL-8 
355 
specified by the Court for reasons to be recorded in writing but not later 
than ninety days from the date of service of summons (Order 8, R1). 
Provision though negatively worded is procedural. It does not deal with 
power of court or provide consequences of non-extension of time. The 
provision can therefore be read as directory. (Shaikh Salim Haji Abdul 
Khayumsab v. Kumar & Ors, AIR 2006 SC 398. 
The defendant may appear in person or by a duly instructed pleader or by a 
pleader accompanied by some person to be able to answer all material questions 
relating to the suit. 
Every summons  must be signed by the judge or an authorised officer of the 
Court and sealed with the seal of the Court and be accompanied by a copy of the 
plaint. (Order 5) 
If the requirement of personal appearance of the defendant or plaintiff is felt by 
the Court, then it has to make an order for such appearance. The summons must 
contain a direction that it is for the settlement of issues only or for the final disposal of 
the suit. Every summons must be accompanied by a copy of the plaint. Where no 
date is fixed for the appearance of the defendant, the Court has no power to dismiss 
the suit in default. The summons must also state that the defendant is to produce all 
documents in his possession or power upon which he intends to rely in support of his 
case. 
The ordinary mode of service of summons i.e. direct service is by delivery or 
tendering a copy of it signed by the judge or competent officer of the Court to the 
person summoned either personally or to his agent or any adult male or female 
member of his family, against signature obtained in acknowledgement of the 
services. 
15.  DELIVERY OF SUMMONS BY COURT 
Rule 9 substituted by the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2002 
provides that— 
(1) Where the defendant resides within the jurisdiction of the Court in which the 
suit is instituted, or has an agent resident within that jurisdiction who is empowered to 
accept the service of the summons, the summons shall, unless the Court otherwise 
directs, be delivered or sent either to the proper officer, who may be an officer of a 
Court other than that in which the suit is instituted, to be served by him or one of his 
subordinates or to such courier services as are approved by the Court. 
(2) The services of summons may be made by delivering or transmitting a copy 
thereof by registered post acknowledgement due, addressed to the defendant or his 
agent empowered to accept the service or by speed post or by such courier services 
as are approved by the High Court or by the Court referred to in sub-rule (1) or by 
any other means to transmission of documents (including fax message or electronic 
mail service) provided by the rules made by the High Court. 
Provided that the service of summons under this sub-rule shall be made at the 
expenses of the plaintiff. 
EP-GCL-8 
356 
(3) Where the defendant resides outside the jurisdiction of the Court in which the 
suit is instituted, and the Court directs that the service of summons on that defendant 
may be made by such mode of service of summons as is referred to in sub-rule (3) 
(except by registered post acknowledgement due), the provisions of rule 21 shall not 
apply. 
(4) When an acknowledgement or any other receipt purporting to be signed by 
the defendant or his agent is received by the Court or postal article containing the 
summons is received back by the Court with an endorsement purporting to have 
been made by a postal employee or by any person authorised by the courier service 
to the effect that the defendant or his agent had refused to take delivery of the postal 
article containing the summons or had refused to accept the summons by any other 
means specified in sub-rule (3) when tendered or transmitted to him, the Court 
issuing the summons shall declare that the summons had been duly served on the 
defendant: 
Provided that where the summons was properly addressed, pre-paid and duly 
sent by registered post acknowledgement due, the declaration referred to in this sub-
rule shall be made notwithstanding the fact that the acknowledgement having been 
lost or mislaid, or for any other reason, has not been received by the Court within 
thirty days from the date of issue of summons. 
Where the Court is satisfied that there is reason to believe that the person 
summoned is keeping out of the way for the purpose of avoiding service or that for 
any other reason the summons cannot be served in the ordinary way the Court shall 
order the service of the summons to be served by affixing a copy thereof in some 
conspicuous place in the Court house and also upon some conspicuous part of the 
house in which the person summoned is known to have last resided or carried on 
business or personally worked for gain, or in such other manner as the Court thinks 
fit. (O.5, R.20, „substituted service‟) 
Where defendant resides in another province, a summons may be sent for 
service in another state to such court and in such manner as may be prescribed by 
rules in force in that State. 
The above provisions shall apply to summons to witnesses. 
In the case of a defendant who is a public officer, servant of railways or local 
authority, the Court may, if more convenient, send the summons to the head of the 
office in which he is employed. In the case of a suit being instituted against a 
corporation, the summons may be served (a) on the secretary or on any director, or 
other principal officer of the corporation or (b) by leaving it or sending it by post 
addressed to the corporation at the registered office or if there is no registered office, 
then at the place where the corporation carries on business. (O.29, R.2) 
Where persons are to be sued as partners in the name of their firm, the 
summons shall be served either (a) upon one or more of the partners or (b) at the 
principal place at which the partnership business is carried on within India or upon 
any person having the control or management of the partnership business. Where a 
partnership has been dissolved the summons shall be served upon every person 
whom it is sought to make liable.

Defence — The defendant has to file a written statement of his defence within a 
period of thirty days from the date of service of summons. If he fails to file the written 
statement within the stipulated time period he is allowed to file the same on such 
other day as may be specified by the Court for reasons to be recorded in writing. The 
time period for filing the written statement should not exceed 90 days. 
Where the defendant bases his defence upon a document or relies upon any 
document in his possession in support of his defence or claim for set-off or counter 
claim, he has to enter such document in a list and produce it in Court while 
presenting his written statement and deliver the document and a copy thereof to be 
filed within the written statement. 
Any document which ought to be produced in the Court but is not so produced, 
such document shall not be received in evidence at the time of hearing of the suit 
without the leave of the Court (O.8, R.1 and 1A). However this rule does not apply to 
documents produced for the cross-examination of the plaintiff witnesses or handover 
to a witness merely to refresh his memory. 
Besides, particulars of set-off must be given in the written statement. A plea of 
set-off is set up when the defendant pleads liability of the plaintiff to pay to him, in 
defence in a suit by the plaintiff for recovery of money. Any right of counter claim 
must be stated. In the written statement new facts must be specifically pleaded. The 
defendant must deal specifically with each allegation of fact of which he does not 
admit the truth. An evasive denial is not permissible and all allegations of facts not 
denied specifically or by necessary implication shall be taken to be admitted. 
Appearance of parties and consequence of non-appearance — If both the parties 
do not appear when the suit is called on for hearing, the Court may make an order 
that the suit be dismissed (O.9, R. 3 and 4). If the defendant is absent in spite of 
service of summons and the plaintiff appears, the Court may proceed ex-parte. 
In case the defendant is not served with summons, the Court shall order a 
second summon to be issued. If the summons is served on the defendant without 
sufficient time to appear, the Court may postpone the hearing to a further date. If the 
summon was not served on the defendant in sufficient time due to the plaintiff‟s 
default, the Court shall order the plaintiff to pay costs of adjournment. Where the 
hearing of the suit is adjourned ex-parte and the defendant appears at or before such 
hearing and assigns a good cause for his previous non-appearance, the defendant 
may be heard in answer to the suit on such terms as to costs or otherwise. 
EP-GCL-8 
358 
The defendant is not precluded from taking part in the proceedings even though 
he may not be allowed to file a written statement. If the plaintiff is absent and the 
defendant is present at the hearing of the suit, the Court shall make an order for the 
dismissal of the suit, unless the defendant admits the claim of the plaintiff or a part 
thereof in which case the Court shall pass a decree in favour of the plaintiff in 
accordance with the admission of the defendant and shall dismiss the suit to the 
extent of the remainder (O.9, R.8). 
In any case in which a decree is passed ex-parte against a defendant he may 
apply for setting aside the decree on the ground that the summons was not duly 
served on him or that he was prevented by any sufficient cause from appearing when 
the suit was called on for hearing and the Court shall set aside the decree on such 
terms as to costs payment into Court or otherwise as it deems proper and shall 
appoint a day for proceeding with the suit (O.9, R.13). 
A defendant has four remedies available if an ex-parte decree is passed against 
him : 
 
(i) He may file an appeal against the ex-parte decree under Section 96 of the 
C.P.C. 
 (ii) He may file an application for review of the judgement. (O.47, R.1) 
 (iii) He may apply for setting aside the ex-parte decree. 
 (iv) A suit can also be filed to set aside an ex-parte decree obtained by fraud but 
no suit shall lie for non-service of summons. 
It is open to a party at the trial of a suit to use in evidence any one or more of the 
answers or any part of the answer of the opposite party to interrogatories without 
putting in the others or the whole of such answers. But the court may direct that any 
connected answer should also be put in. 
Discovery and interrogatories and production of documents 
"Discovery" means finding out material facts and documents from an adversary in 
order to know and ascertain the nature of the case or in order to support his own 
case or in order to narrow the points at issue or to avoid proving admitted facts. 
Discovery may be of two kinds — (a) by interrogatories (b) by documents. 
The objects of discovery are to: 
 (a) ascertain the nature of the case of the adversary or material facts for the 
adversary‟s case. 
 (b) obtain admissions of the adversary for supporting the party‟s own case or 
indirectly by impeaching or destroying the adversary‟s case. 
 (c) narrow the points at issue. 
 (d) avoid expense and effort in proving admitted facts. 
Discovery by interrogations — Any party to a suit, by leave of the Court, may 
deliver interrogatories in writing for the examination of the opposite parties. But 
interrogatories will not be allowed for the following purposes : 
 
(i) for obtaining discovery of facts which relates exclusively to the evidence of 
the adversary‟s case or title. 
 
EP-GCL-8 
359 
 (ii) to interrogate any confidential communications between the adversary and 
his counsel. 
 (iii) to obtain disclosures injurious to public interests. 
 (iv) interrogatories that are of a „fishing‟ nature i.e. which do not relate to some 
definite and existing state of circumstances but are resorted to in a 
speculative manner to discover something which may help a party making 
the interrogatories. 
Discovery by documents — All documents relating to the matters in issue in the 
possession or power of any adversary can be inspected by means of discovery by 
documents. Any party may apply to the Court for an order directing any other party to 
the suit to make discovery on oath the documents which are or which have been in 
his possession or powers relating to any matter in question. The Court may on 
hearing the application either refuse or adjourn it, if it is satisfied that such discovery 
is not necessary at all or not necessary at the stage. Or if it thinks fit in its discretion, 
it may make order for discovery limited to certain classes of documents. 
Every party to a suit may give notice to the other party at or before the settlement 
of issues to produce for his inspection any document referred to in the pleadings or 
affidavits of the other party. If the other party refuses to comply with this order he 
shall not be allowed to put any such document in evidence (O.11, R.15), unless he 
satisfies the Court that such document relates only to his own title, he being a 
defendant to the suit or any other ground accepted by the Court. Documents not 
referred to in the pleadings or affidavits may be inspected by a party if the Court 
allows (O.11, R.18). 
A party may refuse to produce the document for inspection on the following 
grounds: 
 
(i) where it discloses a party‟s evidence 
 (ii) when it enjoys a legal professional privilege 
 (iii) when it is injurious to public interest 
 (iv) denial of possession of document. 
If a party denies by an affidavit the possession of any document, the party 
claiming discovery cannot cross-examine upon it, nor adduce evidence to contradict 
it, because in all questions of discovery the oath of the party making the discovery is 
conclusive (Kedarnath v. Vishwanath, (1924) 46 All. 417). 
Admission by parties — "Admission" means that one party accepts the case of 
the other party in whole or in part to be true. Admission may be either in pleadings or 
by answers to interrogatories, by agreement of the parties or admission by notice. 
Issues — Issues arise when a material proposition of fact or law is affirmed by 
one party and denied by the other. Issues may be either of fact or of law. 
It is incumbent on the Court at the first hearing of the suit after reading the plaint 
and the written statement and after ascertaining and examination of the parties if 
necessary regarding the material propositions of law and facts, to frame the issues 
thereon for decision of the case. Where the Court is of the opinion that the suit can be 
disposed off on issues of law only, it shall try those issues first and postpone the 
EP-GCL-8 
360 
? 
framing of the other issues until after that issue has been determined and may deal 
with the suit in accordance with the decision of that issue. 
Issues are to be framed on material proportions of fact or law which are to be 
gathered from the following— 
 
(i) Allegations made in the plaint and written statement, 
 (ii) Allegations made by the parties or persons present on their behalf or their 
pleaders on oath, 
 (iii) Allegations in answer to interrogatories, 
 (iv) Contents of documents produced by the parties, 
 (v) Statements made by parties or their representatives when examined, 
 (vi) From examination of a witness or any documents ordered to be produced. 
Hearing of the suit — The plaintiff has the right to begin unless the defendant 
admits the fact alleged by the plaintiff and contends that either in point of law or on 
some additional facts alleged by the defendant, the plaintiff is not entitled to any part 
of the relief sought by him and in such a case the defendant has a right to begin 
(O.18, R.1). Where there are several issues, the burden of proving some of which lies 
on the other party, the party beginning has an option to produce his evidence on 
those issues or reserve it by way of an answer to the evidence produced by the other 
party, and in the latter case, the party beginning may produce evidence on those 
issues after the other party has produced all his evidence. Care must be taken that 
no part of the evidence should be produced on those issues for which the plaintiff 
reserves a right to produce evidence after the defence has closed his evidence, 
otherwise the plaintiff shall lose his right of reserving evidence (O.18, R.3).

Affidavit — An affidavit is a written statement of the deponent on oath duly 
affirmed before any Court or Magistrate or any Oath Commissioner appointed by the 
Court or before the Notary Public. An affidavit can be used in the following cases: 
 
(i) the Court may at any time of its own motion or on application of any party 
order that any fact may be proved by affidavits (Section 30). 
 (ii) the Court may at any time order that the affidavit of any witness may be read 
at the hearing unless either party bona-fide desires to cross-examine him and 
he can be produced (O.19, R.1). 
 
EP-GCL-8 
361 
 (iii) upon application by a party, evidence of a witness may be given on affidavit, 
but the court may at the instance of either party, order the deponent to attend 
the court for cross-examination unless he is exempted from personal 
appearance. Affidavits are confined to such facts as the deponent is able of 
his own knowledge to prove except on interlocutory applications. (O.19, 
R.2&3). 
Judgement — The Court after the case has been heard shall pronounce 
judgement in an open court either at once or on some future day as may be fixed by 
the court for that purpose of which due notice shall be given to the parties or their 
pleaders (Order XX, Rule 1). The proper object of a judgement is to support by the 
most cogent reasons that suggest themselves final conclusion at which the judge has 
conscientiously arrived. 
If the judgement is not pronounced at once every endeavour shall be made by 
the Court to pronounce the judgement within a period of 30 days from the date on 
which the hearing of the case was concluded. However, if it is not practicable to do so 
on the ground of exceptional and extra ordinary circumstances of the case, the Court 
must fix a future day which should not be a day beyond sixty days for the 
pronouncement of the judgement giving due notice of the day so fixed to the 
concerned parties. In Kanhaiyalal v. Anup Kumar, AIR 2003 SC 689, where the 
High Court pronounced the judgment after two years and six months, the 
judgment was set aside by the Supreme Court observing that it would not be 
proper for a Court to sit tied over the matter for such a long period. 
Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the above mentioned case, the 
Gujarat High Court in Ramkishan Guru Mandir v. Ramavtar Bansraj, AIR 2006 
Guj. 34, set aside the judgment which was passed after two and a half years 
after conclusion of arguments holding that where a judgment was delivered 
after two years or more, public at large would have reasons to say bad about 
the Court and the judges. 
The judgement must be dated and signed by the judge. Once the judgement is 
signed it can not afterwords be altered or added to except as provided under Section 
152 or on review. 
It is a substantial objection to a judgement that it does not dispose of the question 
as it was presented by the parties (Reghunatha v. Sri Brozo Kishoro, (1876) 3 I.A., 
154). 
If a judgement is unintelligible, the appellate court may set it aside and 
remand the case to the lower court for the recording of judgement according to 
law after hearing afresh the arguments of the pleaders (Harbhagwan v. Ahmad, 
AIR 1922 Lah. 122). 
Decree 
On judgement a decree follows. Every endeavour must be made to ensure that 
decree is drawn up expeditiously and in any case within a period of 15 days from the 
date on which the judgement is pronounced. It should contain the: 
 
(i) number of the suit(s);  
EP-GCL-8 
362 
 (ii) names and descriptions of the parties and their registered addresses;  
 (iii) particulars of the claim;  
 (iv) relief granted or other determination of the suit;  
 (v) amount of cost incurred and by whom is to be paid. 
Execution 
Execution is the enforcement of decrees or orders of the Court. A decree may be 
executed either by the Court which passed it or by the Court to which it is sent for 
execution. (Section 36. For details refer Order 21) 
16.  APPEALS 
Right of appeal is not a natural or inherent right attached to litigation. Such a right 
is given by the statute or by rules having the force of statute (Rangoon Botatoung 
Company v. The Collector, Rangoon, 39 I.A. 197). 
There are four kinds of appeals provided under the Civil Procedure Code: 
 
(i) Appeals from original Decrees (Sections 96-99-Order 41) 
 (ii) Second Appeals (Sections 100-103-Order 42) 
 (iii) Appeals from Orders (Sections 104-106, 0.43 r. 1-2) 
 (iv) Appeals to the Supreme Court (Sections 109 and 112, Order 45) 
Appeals from original decrees may be preferred in the Court 
superior to the Court passing the decree. An appeal may lie from 
an original decree passed ex parte. Where the decree has been 
passed with the consent of parties, no appeal lies. The appeal 
from original decree lies on a question of law. No appeal lies in any suit of the 
nature cognizable by Courts of small causes when the amount or value of the 
subject matter of the original suit does not exceed ten thousand rupees. 
Second appeal: As per Section 100 of the Civil Procedure Code, an appeal lies to 
the High Court from every decree passed in appeal by any subordinate Court if the 
High Court is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law. Under this 
Section, an appeal may lie from an appellate decree passed ex parte. 
The memorandum of appeal must precisely state the substantial question of law 
involved in the appeal. If the High Court is satisfied that a substantial question of law 
is involved, such question shall be formulated by it and the appeal is to be heard on 
the question so formulated. The respondent is allowed to argue that the case does 
not involve such question. The High Court is empowered to hear the appeal on any 
other substantial question of law not formulated by it if it is satisfied that the case 
involves such question. 
The High Court is not to vary or reverse any order or decree except the order which 
if made in favour of the party applying for revision would have finally disposed of the 
suit or proceedings or against which an appeal lies either to the High Court or any 
subordinate Court. A revision shall not operate as a stay suit or other proceeding before 
the Court except where such suit or other proceeding is stayed by the High Court. 
 
 
EP-GCL-8 
363 
As a general rule the second appeal is on questions of law alone (Section 100). 
The Privy Council in Durga Choudharain v. Jawaher Singh, 
(1891) 18 Cal. 23 P.C., observed that there is no jurisdiction 
to entertain a second appeal on the ground of an erroneous 
finding of fact, however gross or inexcusable the error may 
seem to be... where there is no error or defect in procedure, 
the finding of the first appellate Court upon a question of 
fact is final, if that Court had before it evidence proper for its 
consideration in support of the finding. 
Appeal from orders would lie only from the following orders on grounds of defect 
or irregularity in law— 
 
(i) an order under Section 35A of the Code allowing special costs, and order 
under Section 91 or Section 92 refusing leave to Institute a suit of the nature 
referred to in Section 91 or Section 92, 
 (ii) an order under Section 95 for compensation for obtaining attachment or 
injunction on insufficient ground, 
 (iii) an order under the Code imposing a fine or directing the detention or arrest 
of any person except in execution of a decree. 
 (iv) appealable orders as set out under Order 43, R.1. 
However no appeal shall lie from following orders— 
 
(i) any order specified in clause (a) and 
 (ii) from any order passed in appeal under Section 100. 
Appeals to the Supreme Court would lie in the following cases: 
 
(i) from any decree or order of Civil Court when the case is certified by the Court 
deciding it to be fit for appeal to the Supreme Court or when special leave is 
granted under Section 112 by the Supreme Court itself, 
 (ii) from any judgement, decree or final order passed on appeal by a High Court 
or by any other court of final appellate jurisdiction, 
 (iii) from any judgement, decree or final orders passed by a High Court in 
exercise of original civil jurisdiction. 
The general rule is that the parties to an appeal shall not be entitled to produce 
additional evidence whether oral or documentary. But the appellate court has a 
discretion to allow additional evidence in the following circumstances: 
 
(i) When the lower court has refused to admit evidence which ought to have 
been admitted. 
 (ii) The appellate court requires any document to be produced or any witness to 
be examined to enable it to pronounce judgement. 
 (iii) for any other substantial cause. 
but in all such cases the appellate court shall record its reasons for admission of 
additional evidence.

The essential factors to be stated in an appellate judgement are (a) the points for 
determination, (b) the decision thereon, (c) the reasons for the decision, and (d) 
where the decree appealed from is reversed or varied, the relief to which the 
appellant is entitled (O.41, R.31). 
The judgement shall be signed and dated by the judge or judges concurring 
therein.

17.  REFERENCE, REVIEW AND REVISION 
Reference to High Court 
Subject to such conditions as may be prescribed, at any time before judgement a 
court in which a suit has been instituted may state a case and refer the same for 
opinion of the High Court and the High Court may make such order thereon as it 
thinks fit. (Section 113 Also refer to Rule 1 of Order 46). 
Review 
The right of review has been conferred by Section 114 and Order 47 Rule 1 of 
the Code. It provides that any person considering himself aggrieved by a decree or 
order may apply for a review of judgement to the court which passed the decree or 
made the order on any of the grounds as mentioned in Order 47 Rule 1, namely— 
 
(i) discovery by the applicant of new and important matter or evidence which, 
after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could not 
be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or order made, 
or 
 (ii) on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or 
 (iii) for any other sufficient reason, 
and the Court may make such order thereon as it thinks fit. 
Revision 
Section 115 deals with revision. The High Court may call for the record of any 
case which has been decided by any Court subordinate to such High Court and in 
which no appeal lies thereto, and if such subordinate Court appears— 
 
(i) to have exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it by law, or 
 
EP-GCL-8 
365 
? 
 (ii) to have failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested, or 
 (iii) to have acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with material 
irregularity, 
the High Court may make such order as it thinks fit. 
Provided that the High Court shall not vary or reverse any order made or any 
order deciding an issue in the course of a suit or proceeding except where the order, 
if it had been made in favour of the party applying for revision would have finally 
disposed of the suit or other proceedings. 
The High Court shall not vary or reverse any decree or order against which an 
appeal lies either to the High Court or any Court subordinate thereto. 
A revision shall not operate as a stay of suit or other proceeding before the Court 
except where such suit or proceeding is stayed by the High Court. 
18.  SUITS BY OR AGAINST A CORPORATION 
Signature or verification of pleading 
In suits by or against a corporation, any pleading may be signed and verified on 
behalf of the corporation, by the secretary or by any director or other principal officer 
of the corporation who is able to depose to the facts of the case. (O.29, R.1) 
Service of summons 
Subject to any provision regulating service of process, where the suit is against a 
corporation, the summons may be served: 
 (a) on the secretary or any director or other principal officer of the corporation, or 
 (b) by leaving it or sending it by post addressed to the corporation at the 
registered office or if there is no registered office then at the place where the 
corporation carries on business. (O.29, R. 2) 
Power of the Court to require personal attendance 
The Court may at any stage of the suit, require the personal appearance of the 
secretary or any director, or other principal officer of the corporation who may be able 
to answer material questions relating to the suit. (O.29, R.3)

19.  SUITS BY OR AGAINST MINORS 
A minor is a person (i) who has not completed the age of 18 years and (ii) for 
whose person or property a guardian has been appointed by a Court, for whose 
property is under a Court of Wards, the age of majority is completed at the age of 21 
years. 
Every suit by a minor shall be instituted in his name by a person who in such suit 
shall be called the next friend of the minor. The next friend should be a person who is 
of sound mind and has attained majority. However, the interest of such person is not 
adverse to that of the minor and that he is not in the case of a next friend, a 
defendant for the suit. (O.32, Rules 1 and 4). 
Where the suit is instituted without a next friend, the defendant may apply to have 
the plaint taken off the file, with costs to be paid by the pleader or other person by 
whom it was presented. (O.32, R.2). 
Where the defendant is a minor the Court, on being satisfied of the fact of his 
minority, shall appoint a proper person to be guardian for the suit for such minor 
[O.32, R.3(1)].  An order for the appointment of a guardian for the suit may be 
obtained upon application in the name and on behalf of the minor or by the plaintiff 
[O.32, R.3(2)]. 
A person appointed as guardian for the suit for a minor shall, unless his 
appointment is terminated by retirement, removal or death, continues as such 
throughout all proceeding arising out of the suit including proceedings in any 
appellate or revisional court and any proceedings in the execution of a decree. [O.32, 
R.3(5)] 
When minor attain majority — When the minor plaintiff attains majority he may 
elect to proceed with the suit or application or elect to abandon it. If he elects the 
former course, he shall apply for an order discharging the next frined and for leave to 
proceed in his own name and the title of the suit will be corrected. If he elects to 
abandon the suit or application, he shall, if a sole plaintiff or sole applicant apply for 
an order to dismiss the suit on repayment of the costs incurred by the defendant or 
opposite party etc. (For details see Rules 12 and 13 - Order 32) 
20.  SUMMARY PROCEDURE 
A procedure by way of summary suit applies to suits upon bill of exchange, 
hundies or promissory notes, when the plaintiff desires to proceed under the 
provisions of Order 37. Order 37 provides for a summary procedure in respect of 
certain suits. The object is to prevent unreasonable obstruction by a defendant. 
(Order 37) 
The rules for summary procedure are applicable to the following Courts: 
 (1) High Courts, City Civil Courts and Small Courts; 
 (2) Other Courts: In such Courts the High Courts may restrict the operation of 
order 37 by issuing a notification in the Official Gazette. 
The debt or liquidated demand in money payable by the defendant should arise 
on a written contract or on an enactment or on a guarantee. 
 
EP-GCL-8 
367 
? 
Institution of summary suits 
Such suit may be instituted by presenting a plaint containing the following 
essentials: 
 (1) a specific averment to the effect that the suit is filed under this order; 
 (2) that no relief which does not fall within the ambit of this rule has been 
claimed; 
 (3) the inscription immediately below the number of the suit in the title of the suit 
that the suit is being established under Order 37 of the CPC. 
Leave to defend 
Order 37 rule 3 prescribe the mode of service of summons etc. and leave to 
defend. The defendant is not entitled to defend the suit unless he enters an 
appearance within 10 days from the service of summons. Such leave to defend may 
be granted unconditional or upon such term as the Court or the Judge may think fit. 
However, such leave shall not be granted where: 
 (1) the Court is satisfied that the facts disclosed by the defendant do not indicate 
that he has a substantial defence or that the defences are frivolous or 
veracious, and 
 (2) the part of the amount claimed by the plaintiff and admitted by the defendant 
to be due from him is deposited by him in the Court. 
On the hearing of such summon for judgement, the plaintiff shall be entitled to 
judgement provided the defendant has not applied for leave to defend or if such 
application has been made and is refused or where the defendant is permitted to 
defend but he fails to give the required security within the prescribed time or to carry 
out such other precautions as may have been directed by the Court. 
After decree, the Court may, under special circumstances set-aside the decree 
and if necessary stay or set-aside execution, and may give leave to the defendant to 
appear and to defend the suit. (Rule 4 order 37) 
The summary suit must be brought within one year from the date on which the 
debt becomes due and payable, whereas the period of limitation for suits for ordinary 
cases under negotiable instrument is three years.

LESSON ROUND-UP 
 
 
The Civil Procedure Code consists of two parts. 158 Sections form the first part 
and the rules and orders contained in Schedule I form the second part. The 
object of the Code generally is to create jurisdiction while the rules indicate the 
mode in which the jurisdiction should be exercised. 
 
The Code defines important terms that have been used thereunder and deals 
with different types of courts and their jurisdiction. Jurisdiction means the 
authority by which a Court has to decide matters that are brought before it for 
adjudication. 
 
Under the Code of Civil Procedure, a civil court has jurisdiction to try a suit if two 
conditions are fulfilled: (i) the suit must be of a civil nature; and (ii) the cognizance 
of such suit should not have been barred. Jurisdiction of a court may be of four 
kinds: jurisdiction over the subject matter; local or territorial jurisdiction; original 
and appellate jurisdiction; pecuniary jurisdiction depending on pecuniary value of 
the suit. 
 
Section 10 deals with stay of civil suits. The object of the rule contained in 
Section 10 is to prevent courts of concurrent jurisdiction from simultaneously 
entertaining and adjudicating upon two parallel suits in respect of same matter in 
issue. The section intends to protect a person from multiplicity of proceedings 
and to avoid a conflict of decisions. 
 
The Code embodies the doctrine of res judicata that is, bar or restraint on 
repetition of litigation of the same issues. It enacts that since a matter is finally 
decided by a competent court, no party can be permitted to reopen it in a 
subsequent litigaton. It is pragmatic principle accepted and provided in law that 
there must be a limit or end to litigation on the same issues. In the absence of 
such a rule there would be no end to litigation and the parties would be put to 
constant trouble, harassment and expenses. 
 
In any suit for restraining the defendant from committing a breach of contract or 
other injury of any kind, whether compensation is claimed or not, the plaintiff may, 
at any time after the commencement of the suit, and either before or after 
judgement, apply to the court for a temporary injunction to restrain the defendant 
from committing the breach of contract or injury complained of, or any breach of 
contract or injury of a like nature arising out of the same contract or relating to the 
same property or right. The Court may grant an injunction on such terms 
including keeping of an account and furnishing security, etc. as it may think fit. 
 
The grant of a temporary injunction is a matter of discretion of Courts. Such 
injunction may be granted if the Court finds that there is a substantial question to 
be investigated and that matter should be preserved in status until final disposal 
of that question. 
 
EP-GCL-8 
369 
 
The Code also provides for making certain interlocutory orders. The court has 
power to order sale of any moveable property which is the subject-matter of the 
suit or attached before judgement in such suit which is subject to speedy and 
natural decay or for any just and sufficient cause desirable to be sold at once. 
 
It can also order for detention, preservation or inspection of any property which is 
the subject-matter of such suit, or as to which any question may arise therein. 
And for that purpose it can authorise any person to enter upon or into any land or 
building in the possession of any other party to such suit or authorise any 
samples to be taken or observation to be made or experiment to be tried for the 
purpose of obtaining full information. 
 
Suit ordinarily is a civil action started by presenting a plaint in duplicate to the 
Court containing concise statement of the material facts, on which the party 
pleading relies for his claim or defence. In every plaint the facts must be proved 
by an affidavit. 
 
The main essentials of the suit are: (i) the opposing parties; (ii) the cause of 
action; (iii) the subject matter of the suit, and (iv) the relief(s) claimed. 
 
Every suit shall be instituted in the Court of the lowest grade to try it. The Code 
specifies the categories of suits that shall be instituted in the court within the local 
limits of whose jurisdiction the property is situated. This is subject to the 
pecuniary or other limitations prescribed by any law. The various stages in 
proceedings of a suit have been elaborately laid down under the Code. 
 
It also lays down provisions relating to appeals, reference, review and revision. 
Any person who feels aggrieved by any decree or order passed by the court may 
prefer an appeal in a superior court if an appeal is provided against that decree 
or order or may make an application for review or revision. In certain cases, a 
subordinate court may make a reference to a High Court. 
 
A procedure by way of summary suit applies to suits upon bill of exchange, 
hundies or promissory notes, when the plaintiff desires to proceed under the 
provisions of Order 37. Order 37 provides for a summary procedure in respect of 
certain suits. The object is to prevent unreasonable obstruction by a defendant. 
The summary suit must be brought within one year from the date on which the 
debt becomes due and payable, whereas the period of limitation for suits for 
ordinary cases under negotiable instrument is three years.

THE CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE, 1973 
  
 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Criminal law occupies a pre-dominant place among the agencies of social control and 
is regarded as a formidable weapon that society has forged to protect itself against 
anti-social behaviour. The law of criminal procedure is intended to provide a 
mechanism for the enforcement of criminal law. Without the proper procedural law the 
substantive criminal law which defines offences and provides punishment for them 
would be almost worthless. The objective of this lesson is to impart knowledge to the 
students so that they develop proper perspective about the important provisions of the 
criminal procedure.  At the end of the Study Lesson you should be able to understand 

1.  INTRODUCTION 
The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Cr. P.C.) was repealed by the Code of 
1973 enacted by Parliament on 25th January, 1974 and made effective from 1.4.1974 
so as to consolidate and amend the law relating to Criminal Procedure. Company 
Secretaries and the secretarial profession would have relatively less to do with the 
Code of Criminal Procedure than with other procedural laws, except for safeguarding 
against incurring of liability for criminal offences by Directors, Secretary, Manager or 
other Principal Officer under different corporate and industrial laws. Nevertheless, it is 
necessary that company secretaries and other secretarial staff should be familiar with 
some of the relevant features of the Code. It is an Act to consolidate and amend the 
371 
EP-GCL-9 
372 
law relating to the procedure to be followed in apprehending the criminals, 
investigating the criminal cases and their trial before the Criminal Courts. It is an 
adjective law but also contains provisions of substantive nature (e.g. Chapters VIII, 
IX, X and XI). It‘s  object is to provide a machinery for determining the guilt of and 
imposing punishment on offenders under the substantive criminal law, for example, 
the Indian Penal Code (I.P.C.). The two Codes are to be read together. The Code 
also provides machinery for punishment of offences under other Acts. 
2.  IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS 
Offence 
Section 2(n) of the Cr.P.C. defines the word "offence" to mean any act or 
ommission made punishable by any law for the time being in force and includes any 
act in respect of which a complaint may be made under Section 20 of the Cattle-
trespass Act, 1871. However, the term is more elaborately defined in Section 40 of 
the I.P.C. which states that "offence" denotes a thing made punishable by the Code. 
Section 39 of the Cr. P.C. imposes a duty on every person who is aware of the 
commission of or of intention to commit an offence, to give information of certain 
offences which are specified in Clause (i) to (xii) of sub-Section (1). An offence is 
what the legislature classes as punishable. Mens Rea a bad intention or guilt is an 
essential ingredient in every offence. 
Mens rea 
Mens rea means a guilty mind. The fundamental principle of penal liability is 
embodied in the maxim actus non facit ream nisi mens sit rea. The act itself does not 
constitute guilt unless done with a guilty intent. Thus, unless an act is done with a 
guilty intention, it will not be criminally punishable. The general rule to be stated is 
―there must be a mind at fault before there can be a crime‖. Mens rea is a subjective 
matter. Thus mens rea is an essential ingredient in every criminal offence. 
The motive is not an intention. Intention involves foresight or knowledge of the 
probable or likely consequences of an injury. In short, mens rea is the state of mind 
which accompanies and directs the conduct resulting in the actus reus. 
Bailable Offence and Non-bailable Offence 
A "bailable offence" means an offence which is shown as bailable in the First 
Schedule or which is made bailable by any other law for the time being in force. 
"Non-bailable" offence means any other offence. [Section 2(a)] 
Cognizable Offence and Non-cognizable Offence 
"Cognizable offence" means an offence for which, and "cognizable case" means 
a case in which, a police officer may, in accordance with the First Schedule or under 
any other law for the time being in force, arrest without warrant. 
"Non-cognizable offence" means an offence for which, and "non-cognizable" 
case means a case in which, a police officer has no authority to arrest without 
warrant. Thus, a non-cognizable offence needs special authority to arrest by the 
police officer. [Section 2(c) and 2(l)] 
In order to be a cognizable case under Section 2(c) of the Code, it would be 
enough if one or more (not ordinarily all) of the offences are cognizable.

(Note: It may be observed from the First Schedule that non-cognizable offences 
are usually bailable while cognizable offences are generally non-bailable).

 (a) A guilty personality 
 (b) A guilty mind or intent 
 (c) An intention 
 (d) A motive 
Correct Answer: (b) 
 
Complaint 
"Complaint" means any allegation made orally or in writing to a Magistrate, with a 
view to his taking action under this Code, that some person, whether known or 
unknown, has committed an offence, but it does not include a police report. [Section 
2(d)] 
However, a report made by the police officer in a case which discloses after 
investigation, the commission of a non-cognizable offence shall be deemed to be a 
complaint, and the police officer making the report as a complainant. In general a 
complaint into an offence can be filed by any person except in cases of offences 
relating to marriage, defamation and offences mentioned under Sections 195 and 197. 
A complaint in a criminal case is what a plaint is in a civil case. The requisites of 
a complaint are: 
 
(i) an oral or a written allegation; 
 (ii) some person known or unknown has committed an offence; 
 (iii) it must be made to a magistrate; and 
 (iv) it must be made with the object that he should take action. 
There is no particular format of a complaint. A petition addressed to the 
Magistrate containing an allegation that an offence has been committed, and ending 
with a prayer that the culprit be suitably dealt with is a complaint. (Mohd. Yousuf v. 
Afaq Jahan, AIR 2006 SC 705). 
Police report is expressly excluded from the definition of complaint but the 
explanation to Section 2(d) makes it clear that such report shall be deemed to be a 
complaint where after investigation it discloses commission of a non-cognizable 
offence. Police report means a report forwarded by a police officer to a Magistrate 
under Sub-section (2) of Section 173.

State whether the following statement is “True” or “False” 
In a non-cognizable case, a police officer can arrest a person without a warrant. 
Correct Answer: False 
 
Bail 
It means the release of the accused from the custody of the officers of law and 
entrusting him to the private custody of persons who are sureties to produce the 
accused to answer the charge at the stipulated time or date. 
An "anticipatory bail" is granted by the High Court or a Court of Session, to a 
person who apprehends arrest for having committed a non-bailable offence, but has 
not yet been arrested (Section 438). An opportunity of hearing must be given to the 
opposite party before granting anticipatory bail (State of Assam v. R.K. Krishna 
Kumar AIR 1998 SC 144). 
Inquiry 
It means every inquiry other than a trial, conducted under this Code by a 
Magistrate or Court. [Section 2(g)]. It carries the following three features: 
 
— the inquiry is different from a trial in criminal matters; 
 
— inquiry is wider than trial; 
 
— it stops when trial begins. 
Investigation 
It includes all the proceedings under this Code for the collection of evidence 
conducted by a police officer or by any person (other than a Magistrate) who is 
authorised by a Magistrate in this behalf. [Section 2(h)] 
The three terms — ‗investigation‘, ‗inquiry‘ and ‗trial‘ denote three different stages 
of a criminal case. The first stage is reached when a police officer either on his own 
or under orders of a Magistrate investigates into a case (Section 202). If he finds that 
no offence has been committed, he submits his report to the Magistrate who drops 
the proceedings. But if he is of different opinion, he sends that case to a Magistrate 
and then begins the second stage—a trial or an inquiry. The Magistrate may deal with 
the case himself and either convict the accused or discharge or acquit him. In serious 
offences the trial is before the Session‘s Court, which may either discharge or convict 
or acquit the accused. (Chaper XVIII) 
Judicial Proceeding 
It includes any proceeding in the course of which evidence is or may be legally 
taken on oath. The term judicial proceeding includes inquiry and trial but not 
investigation. [Section 2(i)] 
 
EP-GCL-9 
375 
? 
Pleader 
With reference to any proceedings in any Court, it means a person authorised by 
or under any law for the time being in force, to practise in such Court and includes 
any other person appointed with the premission of the Court to act in such 
proceeding. [Section 2(q)] 
It is an inclusive definition and a non-legal person appointed with the permission 
of the Court will also be included. 
Public Prosecutor 
A "public prosecutor" means any person appointed under Section 24, and 
includes any person acting under the directions of a Public Prosecutor. [Section 2(u)] 
Public prosecutor, though an executive officer is, in a larger sense, also an officer 
of the Court and he is bound to assist the Court with his fair views and fair exercise of 
his functions. 
Summons and Warrant Cases 
"Summons case" means a case relating to an offence and not being a warrant 
case. [Section 2(w)] A "Warrant case" means a case relating to an offence 
punishable with death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term exceeding 
two years. [Section 2(x)] 
Those cases which are punishable with imprisonment for two years or less are 
summons cases, the rest are all warrant cases. Thus, the division is based on 
punishment which can be awarded. The procedure for the trial of summons cases is 
provided by Chapter XX and for warrant cases by Chapter XIX.

3.  CLASSES OF CRIMINAL COURTS 
Following are the different classes of criminal courts: 
 (1) High Courts; 
 (2) Courts of Session; 
 (3) Judicial Magistrates of the first class, and, in any metropolitan area; 
Metropolitan Magistrates; 
 (4) Judicial Magistrates of the second class; and 
 (5) Executive Magistrates; 
EP-GCL-9 
376 
Besides this, the Courts may also be constituted under any other law. The 
Supreme Court is also vested with some criminal powers. Article 134 confers 
appellate jurisdiction on the Supreme Court in regard to criminal matters from a High 
Court in certain cases. 
4.  POWER OF COURTS 
Chapter III of Cr.P.C. deals with power of Courts. One of such power is to try 
offences. Offences are divided into two categories: 
 (a) those under the Indian Penal Code; and 
 (b) those under any other law. 
According to Section 26, any offence under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 may be 
tried by the High Court or the Court of Session or any other Court by which such 
offence is shown in the First Schedule to be triable, whereas any offence under any 
other law shall be tried by the Court mentioned in that law and if not mentioned, it 
may be tried by the High Court or any other Court by which such offence is shown in 
the First Schedule to be triable. 
This Section is a general Section and is subject to the other provisions of the 
Code. 
Power of the Court to pass sentences: 
(a)  Sentences which High Courts and Sessions Judges may pass 
According to Section 28, a High Court may pass any sentence authorised by law. 
A Sessions Judge or Additional Sessions Judge may pass any sentence authorised 
by law, but any sentence of death passed by any such judge shall be subject to 
confirmation by the High Court. 
An Assistant Sessions Judge may pass any sentence authorised by law except a 
sentence of death or of imprisonment for life or of imprisonment for a term exceeding 
ten years. 
Thus, Section 26 of the Code enumerates the types of Courts in which different 
offences can be tried and then under Section 28, it spells out the limits of sentences 
which such Courts are authorised to pass. 
(b)  Sentences which Magistrates may pass 
Section 29 lays down the quantum of sentence which different categories of 
Magistrates are empowered to impose. The powers of individual categories of 
Magistrates to pass the sentence are as under: 
 
(i) The Court of a Chief Judicial Magistrate may pass any sentence authorised 
by law except a sentence of death or of imprisonment for life or of 
imprisonment for a term exceeding seven years. 
 (ii) A Magistrate of the first class may pass a sentence of imprisonment for a 
term not exceeding three years or of a fine not exceeding five thousand 
rupees, or of both. 
 
EP-GCL-9 
377 
? 
 (iii) A Magistrate of the second class may pass a sentence of imprisonment for a 
term not exceeding one year, or of fine not exceeding one thousand rupees, 
or of both. 
 (iv) A Chief Metropolitan Magistrate shall have the powers of the Court of a Chief 
Judicial Magistrate and that of a Metropolitan Magistrate, and the powers of 
the Court of a Magistrate of the First class. 
(c)  Sentence of imprisonment in default of fine 
Where a fine is imposed on an accused and it is not paid, the law provides that 
he can be imprisoned for a term in addition to a substantive imprisonment awarded to 
him, if any. Section 30 defines the limits of Magistrate‘s powers to award 
imprisonment in default of payment of fine. 
It provides that the Court of a Magistrate may award such term of imprisonment 
in default of payment of fine as is authorised by law provided the that the term: 
 
(i) is not in excess of the powers of the Magistrate under Section 29; and 
 (ii) where imprisonment has been awarded as part of the substantive sentence, 
it should not exceed 1/4th of the term of imprisonment which the Magistrate 
is competent to inflict as punishment for the offence otherwise than as 
imprisonment in default of payment of the fine. 
(d) Sentences in cases of conviction of several offences at one trial 
Section 31 relates to the quantum of punishment which the Court is authorised to 
impose where the accused is convicted of two or more offences at one trial.

5.  ARREST OF PERSONS 
Section 41 enumerates different categories of cases in which a 
police officer may arrest a person without an order from a Magistrate 
and without a warrant. These include: 
 
(a) who has been concerned in any cognizable offence or against 
whom a reasonable complaint has been made, or credible information has 
been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists, of his having been so 
concerned; or 
 (b) who has in his possession without lawful excuse, the burden of proving which 
excuse shall lie on such person, any implement of housebreaking; or 
EP-GCL-9 
378 
 (c) who has been proclaimed as an offender either under this Code or by order 
of the State Government; or 
 (d) in whose possession anything is found which may reasonably be suspected 
to be stolen property and who may reasonably be suspected of having 
committed an offence with reference to such thing; or 
 (e) who obstructs a police officer while in the execution of his duty, or who has 
escaped, or attempts to escape, from lawful custody; or 
 
(f) who is reasonably suspected of being a deserter from any of the Armed 
Forces of the Union; or 
 (g) who has been concerned in, or against whom a reasobale complaint has 
been made, or credible information has been received, or a reasonable 
suspicion exists, of his having been concerned in, any act committed at any 
place out of India which, if committed in India, would have been punishable 
as an offence, and for which he is, under any law relating to extradition, or 
otherwise, liable to be apprehended or detained in custody in India; or 
 (h) who being a released convict, commits a breach of any rule, relating to 
notification of residence or change of or absence from residence; or 
 
(i) for whose arrest any requistion, whether written or oral, has been received 
from another police officer, provided that the requisition specifies the person 
to be arrested and the offence or other causes for which the arrest is to be 
made and it appears therefrom that the person might lawfully be arrested 
without a warrant by the officer who issued the requisition. (Section 41) 
Arrest on refusal to give name and residence 
If any person who is accused of committing a non-cognizable offence does not 
give his name, residence or gives a name and residence which the police officer feels 
to be false, he may be taken into custody. However, such person cannot be detained 
beyond 24 hours if his true name and address cannot be ascertained or fails to 
execute a bond or furnish sufficient sureties. In that event he shall be forwarded to 
the nearest Magistrate having jurisdiction. (Section 42) 
Arrest by a private person 
A private person may arrest or cause to be arrested any person who in his 
presence commits a non-bailable and cognizable offence or who is a proclaimed 
offender (Section 43). This right of arrest arises under the Common Law which 
applies to India Ramaswamy Aiyar (1921) 44 Mad. 913. 
Arrest by Magistrate 
Under Section 44 clause (1), the Magistrate has been given power to arrest a 
person who has committed an offence in his presence and also commit him to 
custody. Under in clause 2, the Magistrate has power to arrest a person for which he 
is competent and has also been authorised to issue a warrant. However, Section 45 
protects members of Armed Forces from arrest where they do something in 
discharge of their official duties. They could be arrested only after obtaining the 
consent of the Central Government. 
 
EP-GCL-9 
379 
Arrest how made 
Section 46 sets out the manner in which an arrest is to be made. The Section 
authorises a police officer or other person making an arrest to actually touch or 
confine the body of the person to be arrested and such police officer or other person 
may use all necessary means to effect the arrest if there is forcible resistance. The 
Section does not give a right to cause the death of a person who is not accused of an 
offence punishable with death sentence or life imprisonment. The word "arrest" when 
used in its ordinary and natural sense means the apprehension or restrain or the 
deprivation of one‘s personal liberty to go where he pleases. The word "arrest" 
consists of taking into custody of another person under authority empowered by law, 
for the purpose of holding or detaining him to answer a criminal charge and 
preventing the commission of a criminal offence. 
Section 47 is an enabling provision and is to be used by the police officer with 
regard to exigencies of a situation. Section 48 authorises a police officer to pursue 
the offender in to any place in India for the purpose of effecting his arrest without 
warrant. Ordinarily, a police officer is not at liberty to go outside India and to arrest an 
offender without a warrant, but if he can arrest an offender without warrant who 
escapes into any place in India, he can be pursued and arrested by him without 
warrant. (See also Section 60) 
Persons arrested are to be taken before the Magistrate or officer-in-charge of a 
police station without unnecessary delay and subject to the provisions relating to bail, 
Article 22(2) of the Constitution of India also provides for producing the arrested 
person before the Magistrate within 24 hours. 
When a person is arrested under a warrant, Section 76 becomes applicable, and 
when he is arrested without a warrant, he can be kept into custody for a period not 
exceeding 24 hours, and before the expiry of that period he is to be produced before 
the nearest Magistrate, who can under Section 167 order his detention for a term not 
exceeding 15 days, or he can be taken to a Magistrate, under whose jurisdiction he is 
to be tried, and such Magistrate can remand him to custody for a term which may 
exceed 15 days but not more than 60 days. 
Officers in-charge of the concerned police stations shall report to the Magistrate 
the cases of all persons arrested without warrant, within the limits of their respective 
police stations whether such persons have been admitted to bail or otherwise. 
(Section 58) 
A person arrested by a police officer shall be discharged only on his own bond or 
on bail or under the special order of a Magistrate, (Section 59). If a person in lawful 
custody escapes or is rescued, the person, from whose custody he escaped or was 
rescued, is empowered to pursue and arrest him in any place in India and although 
the person making such arrest is not acting under a warrant and is not a police officer 
having authority to arrest, nevertheless, the provisions of Section 47 are applicable 
which stipulates provisions relating to search of a place entered by the person sought 
to be arrested.

6.  SUMMONS AND WARRANTS 
The general processes to compel appearance are: 
 
(1) Summons (Section 61) 
 
(2) Warrants (Section 70) 
7.  SUMMONS 
A summon is issued either for appearance or for producing a document or thing 
which may be issued to an accused person or witness. Every summons issued by the 
Court shall be in writing, in duplicate, signed by the Presiding Officer of such Court or 
by such officer as is authorised by the High Court and shall bear the seal of the Court 
(Section 61). The summons should be clear and specific in its terms as to the title of 
the Court, the place at which, the day and time of the day when, the attendance of 
the person summoned is required. 
Service of summons 
The summons shall be served by a police officer or by an officer of the Court or 
other public servant (Section 62). In case the service cannot be effected by the 
exercise of due diligence, the serving officer can perform substituted service by 
affixing one of the duplicates of the summons to some conspicuous part of the house 
or homestead in which person summoned ordinarily resides, and thereupon the 
Court, after making such enquiries as it thinks fit may either declare that the 
summons has been duly served or order fresh service, as it considers proper 
(Section 65). 
The service of summons on corporate bodies, and societies 
The service of summons on a corporation may be effected by serving it on the 
secretary, local manager or other principal officer of the corporation, or by letter sent 
by registered post, addressed to the Chief Officer of the corporation in India, in which 
case the service shall be deemed to have been effected when the letter would arrive 
in ordinary course of post. 
The word "corporation" in this Section means an incorporated company or other 
body corporate and includes a society registered under the Societies Registration 
Act, 1860. Thus, the societies may not be formally incorporated, yet they fall within 
the purview of this section. (Section 63) 
When personal service of summons cannot be affected under Section 62, the 
extended service under Section 64 can be secured by leaving one of the duplicates 
with some adult male member of his family residing with him who may also be asked 
to sign the receipt for that. A servant is not a member of the family within the meaning 
of Section 64. 
In the case of a Government Servant, the duplicate copy of the summons shall 
be sent to the head of the office by the Court and such head shall thereupon cause 
the summons to be served in the manner provided by Section 62 and shall return it to 
the Court under his signature with the endorsement required by Section 62. Such 
signature shall be evidence of due service. (Section 66)

8.  WARRANT OF ARREST 
Every warrant of arrest issued by a Court under this Code shall be in writing, 
signed by the presiding officer of such Court, and shall bear the seal of the Court. 
Such warrant shall remain in force until it is cancelled by the Court which issued it, or 
until it is executed. (Section 70) The form of warrant of arrest is Form No. 2 of the 
Second Schedule. The requisites of a warrant are as follows: 
 
1. It must be in writing. 
 
2. It must bear the name and designation of the person who is to execute it; 
 
3. It must give full name and description of the person to be arrested; 
 
4. It must state the offence charged; 
 
5. It must be signed by the presiding officer; and 
 
6. It must be sealed. 
Such warrant is only for protection of a person before the concerned Court and 
not before the police officer. 
Under Section 76 the police officer or other person executing the warrant of 
arrest shall (subject to the provisions of Section 71 as to security) bring the person 
arrested before the Court without unnecessary delay provided that such delay shall 
not in any case exceed 24 hours exclusive of the time necessary for the journey from 
the place of arrest to the Magistrate‘s Court. 
9.  PROCLAMATION AND ATTACHMENT 
Where a warrant remains unexecuted, the Code provides for two remedies: 
 (1) issuing a proclamation (Section 82); and 
 (2) attachment and sale of property (Section 83). 
If a Court has reason to believe that any person against whom a warrant has 
been issued by it has absconded or is concealing himself so that such warrant cannot 
be executed, the Court may publish a written proclamation requiring him to appear at 
EP-GCL-9 
382 
?
a specified place and at a specified time not less than 30 days from the date of 
publishing such proclamation. (Section 82) 
While issuing proclamation, the Magistrate must record to his satisfaction that the 
accused has absconded or is concealing himself. The object of attaching property is 
not to punish him but to compel his appearance. 
10.  SUMMONS TO PRODUCE 
Sometimes it is necessary that a person should produce a document or other 
thing which may be in his possession or power for the purposes of any investigation 
or inquiry under this Code. This can be compelled to be produced by issuing 
summons (Sections 91 and 92) or a warrant (Sections 93 to 98). 
11.  SEARCH WARRANT 
According to Section 93, a search warrant can be issued only in the 
following cases: 
 
(1) where the Court has reason to believe that a person 
summoned to produce any document or other thing will not produce it; 
 (2) where such document or thing is not known to the Court to be in the 
possession of any person; or 
 (3) where a general inspection or search is necesary. However, a search warrant 
may be general or restricted in its scope as to any place or part thereof. 
But such warrant shall not be issued for searching a document, parcel or other 
thing in the custody of the postal or telegraph authority, by a magistrate other than a 
District Magistrate or Chief Judicial Magistrate, nor would such warrant be issued so 
as to affect Sections 123 and 124 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 or the Bankers‘ 
Book Evidence Act, 1891. 
In terms of Section 97 any District Magistrate, Sub-Divisional Magistrate or 
Magistrate of the first class who has reasons to believe that any person is confined 
under such circumstances that the confinement amounts to an offence, he may issue 
a search warrant for the search of the person so confined. The person if found shall 
be immediately produced before the Magistrate for making such orders as in the 
circumstances of the case he thinks proper.

12. SECURITY FOR KEEPING THE PEACE AND GOOD BEHAVIOUR AND 
PROCEEDINGS FOR MAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC ORDER 
(i)  Security for keeping the peace and for good behaviour 
The provisions of Chapter VIII are aimed at persons who are a danger to the 
public by reason of the commission of certain offences by them. The object of this 
chapter is prevention of crimes and disturbances of public tranquillity and breach of 
the peace. 
Security for keeping the peace on conviction 
When a Court of Session or Court of a Magistrate of first class convicts a person 
of any of the offences specified in sub-section (2) or of abetting any such offence and 
is of opinion that it is necessary to take security from such person for keeping the 
peace, the Court may, at the time of passing sentence on such person, order him to 
execute a bond, with or without sureties, for keeping the peace for such period, not 
exceeding three years, as it thinks fit. 
The offences specified under sub-section (2) are as follows: 
 (a) any offence punishable under Chapter VIII of the India Penal Code 1860. 
 (b) any offence which consists of or includes, assault or using criminal force or 
committing mischief; 
 (c) any offence of criminal intimidation; 
 (d) any other offence which caused, or was intended or known to be likely to 
cause a breach of the peace. 
However, if the conviction is set-aside on appeal or otherwise, the bond so 
executed shall become void. (Section 106) 
Security for keeping the peace in other cases 
When an Executive Magistrate receives information that any person is likely to: 
 
(i) commit a breach of peace; or 
 (ii) disturb the public tranquillity; or 
 (iii) do any wrongful act that may probably occasion a breach of the peace; or 
disturb the public tranquillity; 
he may require such person to show cause why he should not be ordered to 
execute a bond for keeping the peace for a period not exceeding one year as the 
Magistrate deem fit. (Section 107) 
(ii)  Maintenance of public order and tranquillity  
A—Unlawful assemblies  
Dispersal of assembly by use of civil force 
Any Executive Magistrate or office in-charge of a police station or, in the absence 
of such officer in-charge, any other officer not below the rank of sub-inspector may 
EP-GCL-9 
384 
command any unlawful assembly or any assembly of five or more persons likely to 
cause a disturbance of the public peace, to disperse and it shall be thereupon the 
duty of the members of such assembly to disperse accordingly. 
If any such assembly does not disperse or conducts itself in a manner as to show 
a determination not to disperse, any Executive Magistrate or police officer referred to 
above may proceed to disperse such assembly by force and may require the 
assistance of any male person not being an officer or member of the armed forces 
and acting as such, for the purpose of dispersing such assembly and if necessary 
arresting and confining the persons who form part of it, in order to disperse such 
assembly. (Section 129) 
Use of armed forces to disperse assembly 
If any such assembly cannot be otherwise dispersed, and if it is necessary for the 
public security that it should be dispersed, the Executive Magistrate of the highest 
rank who is present may cause it to be dispersed by the armed forces and to arrest 
and confine such persons in order to disperse the assembly or to have them 
punished. 
Section 132 protects persons for any act purporting to be done under  
Sections 129 to 131. No prosecution shall be instituted against such persons in any 
criminal Court except with the sanction of Central Government if the person is an 
officer or member of the armed forces or with the sanction of State Government in 
any other case. (Section 130) 
B—Public nuisances 
Conditional order for removal of nuisance 
Section 133 lays down the following public nuisances which can be proceeded 
against: 
 (1) the unlawful obstruction or nuisance should be removed from any public 
place or from any way, river or channel which is or may be lawfully used by 
the public; or 
 (2) carrying on any trade or occupation, or keeping of any goods or 
merchandise, injurious to the health of the community; or 
 (3) the construction of any building or the disposal of any substance, as is likely 
to cause conflagration or explosion; etc. 
 (4) the building, tent or structure near a public place. 
 (5) the dangerous animal requiring destroying, confining or disposal. 
For initiating prevention under this Section the Magistrate should keep in mind 
that he is acting purely in the public interest. For the applicability of clause A, the 
public must have the right of way which is being obstructed. 
Power to issue order in urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger 
As per Section 144 of the Code where in the opinion of a District Magistrate, a 
Sub-divisional Magistrate or any other Executive Magistrate specially empowered by 
 
EP-GCL-9 
385 
the State Government in this behalf, there is sufficient ground for proceeding under 
this Section and immediate prevention or speedy remedy is desirable, in such cases 
the Magistrate may by a written order stating the material facts of the case and 
served in the manner provided by Section 134, direct any person to abstain from a 
certain act or to take certain order with respect to certain property in his possession 
or under his management, if such Magistrate considers that such direction is likely to 
prevent or tends to prevent, obstruction, annoyance of injury to any person lawfully 
employed, or danger to human life, health or safety or a disturbance of the public 
tranquillity, or a riot, or an affray. 
An order under this Section may be passed ex-parte in cases of emergency or in 
cases where the circumstances do not admit of the serving of notice in due time upon 
the person against whom the order is directed. An order under this Section can 
remain in force for two months, and may be extended further for a period not 
exceeding six months by the State Government if it considers necessary. 
13. PREVENTIVE ACTION OF THE POLICE AND THEIR POWERS TO 
INVESTIGATE 
Section 149 authorises a police officer to prevent the commission of any 
cognizable offence. If the police officer receives the information of a design to commit 
such an offence, he can communicate such information to his superior police officer 
and to any other officer whose duty it is to prevent or take cognizance of the 
commission of any such offence. The police officer may arrest the person without 
orders from Magistrate and without a warrant if the commission of such offence 
cannot be otherwise prevented 
The arrested person can be detained in custody only for 24 hours unless his 
further detention is required under any other provsions of this Code or of any other 
law. (Sections 150 and 151) Section 152 authorises a police officer to prevent injury 
to public property. 
Inspection of weights and measures 
Any officer incharge of the police station may without a warrant enter any place 
within the limits of such station for the purpose of inspecting or searching for any 
weights  or  measures  or  instruments  for weighing, used or kept therein, whenever 
he has reason to believe that there are in such place any weights, measures or 
instruments for weighing which are false, and if he finds in such place any false 
weights, measures or instruments he may seize the same  and shall give information 
of such seizure to a Magistrate having jurisdiction. (Section 153) 
14. INFORMATION TO THE POLICE AND THEIR POWERS TO INVESTIGATE 
Information in cognizable cases 
Every information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence, if given 
orally to an officer in charge of a police station, shall be reduced to writing by him or 
under his direction and be read over to the informant. Every such information shall be 
signed by the person giving it and the substance thereof shall be entered in a book 
kept by such officer in such form as may be prescribed by the State Government in 
this behalf. (Section 154) 
The above information given to a police officer and reduced to writing is known 
as First Information Report (FIR). Although such words are not mentioned in the 
EP-GCL-9 
386 
Criminal Procedure Code. The investigation of the case proceeds on this information 
only. Thus, the principal object of this Section is to set the criminal law in motion and 
to obtain information about the alleged criminal activities so as to punish the guilty. 
For the purpose of enabling the police to start investigation, it is open to the 
Magistrate to direct the police to register an FIR. There is nothing illegal in doing so. 
After all registration of an FIR involves only the process of entering the substance of 
the information relating to the commission of the cognizable offence in a book kept by 
the officer-in-charge of the police station as indicated in Section 154 of the Code. 
(Mohd. Yousuf v. Afaq Jahan,  AIR 2006 SC 708.) 
Any person aggrieved by a refusal on the part of an officer incharge of a police 
station to record the information may send the substance of such information in 
writing and by post to the Superintendent of Police concerned who if satisfied that 
such information discloses the commission of a cognizable offence shall either 
investigate the case himself or direct an investigation to be made by any police officer 
subordinate to him. 
A copy of the information as recorded under sub-section (1) shall be given to the 
informant free of cost. 
Information as to non-cognizable cases and investigation of such cases 
When information is given to an officer incharge of a police station of the 
commission within the limits of such station of a non-cognizable offence, he shall 
enter or cause to be entered the substance of the information in a book to be kept by 
such officer in such form as the State Government may prescribe in this behalf and 
refer the informant to the Magistrate. (Section 155) 
The police officer is not authorised to investigate a non-cognizable case without 
the order of Magistrate having power to try such cases, and on receiving the order, 
the police officer may exercise the same powers in respect of investigation as he may 
exercise in a cognizable case. 
Where a case relates to two or more offences of which at least one is cognizable, 
the case shall be deemed to be a cognizable case, notwithstanding that the other 
offences are non-cognizable. [Section 155(4)] 
Police officer’s powers to investigate cognizable case 
In case of a cognizable offence the police officer may conduct investigations 
without the order of a Magistrate. Investigation includes all proceedings under the 
Code for the collection of evidence by the police officer or by any person who is 
authorised by the Magistrate in this behalf. Any Magistrate empowered under Section 
190 may order such investigation as above mentioned. Sections 160 and 161 
authorise a police officer making an investigation to require the attendance of and 
may examine orally any person who appears to be acquainted with the facts and 
circumstances of the case. (Section 156) 
Search by police officer 
This Section authorises general search if the police officer has reason to believe 
that anything necessary for the purpose of an investigations may be found. The 
 
EP-GCL-9 
387 
? 
officer acting under this sub-section must record in writing his reasons for making of a 
search. But, the illegality of search will not affect the validity of the articles or in any 
way vitiate the recovery of the articles and the subsequent trial. (Section 165) 
Whenever any person is arrested or detained in custody and it appears that the 
investigation cannot be completed within the period of twenty four hours as laid down 
in Section 57 and that there are grounds for believing that the accusation or 
information is well founded, the officer in charge of the police station or other 
competent investigation officer shall promptly transmit to the nearest judicial 
Magistrate a copy of the entries in the diary relating to the case, and shall forward the 
accused to such Magistrate at the same time (required to be mentioned day by day 
under Section 172). The Magistrate may then authorise the detention of the accused 
in custody for a term not exceeding of fifteen days. (Section 167) Every investigation 
must be completed without undue delay. On completion of investigation, the 
competent police officer under the Code shall forward a police report with the 
prescribed details to a Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of the offence and 
send along with the report all documents or relevant extracts on which the 
prosecution intends to rely. (Section 173) 
 
Test your knowledge 
State whether the following statement is “True” or “False” 
If a case relates to two or more offences and one of the offences is a cognizable 
offence, the case will be treated as a non- cognizable case. 
Correct Answer: False 
 
15.  POWERS OF MAGISTRATE 
Cognizance of an offence by Magistrate 
Section 190 relates to cognizance of offences by Magistrates. The Court can take 
cognizance of an offence only when conditions requisite for initiation of proceedings 
before it are fulfilled otherwise the Court does not obtain jurisdiction to try the offence 
(Mohd. Safi, AIR 1966 SC 69). 
Any Magistrate of first class and of the second class specially 
empowered may take cognizance of an offence upon: 
 
(1) receiving a complaint of facts constituting such offence; 
 
(2) a police report of such facts; 
 (3) information received from any person other than a police officer; 
 (4) his own knowledge that such offence has been committed. 
When a Magistrate takes cognizance of an offence upon information received 
from any person other than a police officer or upon his own knowledge then the 
accused is informed that he is entitled to to have the case inquired into or tried by 
another Magistrate and if the accused objects to further proceedings before the 
EP-GCL-9 
388 
Magistrate taking cognizance, the case is transferred to other Magistrate as is 
specified by the Chief Judicial Magistrate. (Section 191) 
The Chief Judicial Magistrate may after taking cognizance of an offence transfer 
the case for inquiry or trial to any competent Magistrate subordinate to him. Similarly 
a first class Magistrate may transfer a case to such other competent Magistrate to try 
as the Chief Judicial Magistrate specifies. (Section 192) 
Cognizance of an offence by Courts of Session 
The Court of Session does not take cognizance of any offence, as a Court of 
original jurisdiction unless the case has been committed to it by a competent 
Magistrate. The Additional Sessions Judge and Asstt. Sessions Judge try such cases 
as the High Court may direct or the Sessions Judges may make over to them. 
(Sections 193 and 194) 
Complaints to Magistrates 
A Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence on complaint examines the 
complainant and the witnesses if any upon oath and then the substance of such 
examination is reduced to writing and signed by the complainant and witnesses and 
also by the Magistrate. 
However, when the complaint is made in writing, the Magistrate need not 
examine the complainant and the witnesses. If a public servant in the discharge of his 
official duties or a Court has made the complaint or if the Magistrate makes over the 
case for inquiry or trial to another Magistrate under Section 192. Further, if the 
Magistrate makes over the case to another Magistrate, under Section 192 after 
examining the complainant and the witnesses, they need not to be re-examined by 
the latter Magistrate. (Section 200) 
If a complaint is made to a Magistrate who is not competent to take cognizance 
of the offence, he shall return it for presentation to the proper Court if the complaint is 
in writing, and if the complaint is oral, he should direct the complainant to the proper 
Court. (Section 201) 
The Magistrate enquiring into a case may take evidence of witnesses on oath but 
where the offence is triable by the Court of Session, he shall call upon the 
complainant to produce all his witnesses and examines them on oath. He may 
dismiss the complaint if after considering the statement on oath and the result of the 
investigation or enquiry, there is no sufficient ground for proceeding and may record 
his reasons for doing so. (Sections 201 to 203) 
On the other hand if the Magistrate is of opinion that there is sufficient ground for 
taking cognizance of an offence he may either issue summons for attendance of the 
accused if the case appears to be a summons-case or he may in a warrant case 
issue a warrant or summons for the accused to be produced at a certain time before 
such Magistrate. It is important that no summon or warrant shall be issued against 
the accused unless a list of prosecution witnesses has been filed. In a proceeding 
instituted on the complaint in writing a copy of the complaint is to be sent with every 
summons or warrant. (Section 204)  
Every charge under this Code shall state the offence with which the accused is 
charged specifying the law and the name of the offence, particulars of time and place 
 
EP-GCL-9 
389 
? 
of the alleged offence (Sections 211 and 212). For every distinct offence of which any 
person is accused there shall be a separate charge and every such charge shall be 
tried separately (Section 218). If more than one offence is committed by the same 
person in one series of acts so connected together as to form the same transaction, 
he may be charged with and tried at one trial for every such offence (Section 220). 
Persons accused of the same offence, committed in the course of the same 
transaction, or abetment of such offence may be charged jointly and tried together. 
A person who has once been tried by a Court of competent jurisdiction for an 
offence and is convicted or acquitted of such offence shall while such conviction or 
acquittal remains in force not be liable to be tried again for the same offence, nor on 
the same facts for any other offence A person discharged under Section 258 (i.e. a 
summons-case where there is judgement of acquittal by a Judicial Magistrate) shall 
not be tried again for the same offence except with the consent of the Court by which 
he was discharged or of any other Court to which such Court is subordinate. 
The judgement in every trial in any Criminal Court of original jurisdiction shall be 
pronounced by the presiding officer by delivering or reading out the whole of the 
judgement or the operative part of the judgement in open Court. (Section 353) Every 
judgement should be written in the language of the Court and should contain the 
point or points for determination, the decision thereon and the reasons for the 
decision. It should specify the offence and the Section of Indian Penal Code or other 
law under which the accused is convicted and the punishment to which he is 
sentenced (Section 354). Except as otherwise specified in the Code, no court when it 
has signed its judgement or final order disposing of a case, shall alter or review the 
same except to correct a clerical or arithmetical error (Section 362). A copy of the 
judgement and also if so desired a certified copy are to be given to the accused free 
of cost. (Section 363) 
 
Test your knowledge 
State whether the following statement is “True” or “False” 
Summons or warrant can not be issued against the accused unless and until the list 
of prosecution witnesses has been filed. 
Correct Answer: True 
 
No appeal shall lie from any judgement or order of Criminal Court except as 
provided for by this Code (Section 372). In the case of an acquittal, the State. 
Government may direct the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal to the High Court 
from an original or appellate order of acquittal passed by any Court other than a High 
Court. Every appeal in the case of appealable orders shall be made in the form of a 
petition in writing presented by the appellant or his pleader and shall be accompanied 
by a copy of the judgement or order appealed against. No appeal shall be dismissed 
summarily unless the appellant or his pleader has had a reasonable opportunity of 
being heard in support of the same (Section 384). After perusing such record and 
hearing the parties, the apellant Court may dismiss the appeal if there are no 
sufficient grounds for interfering or alter the findings and acquit or discharge the 
accused or order re-trial by a competent court subordinate to the Appellate Court 
EP-GCL-9 
390 
(Section 386). An Appellate Court may if it thinks additional evidence to be necessary 
shall record its reasons and may either take such evidence itself or direct it to be 
taken by a Magistrate. (Section 391) 
A Court may refer a case to High Court if it is of the opinion that is involves a 
question as to validity of any Act, Ordinance or Regulation and the Court is of opinion 
that such Act, Ordinance, or Regulation is in-operative or invalid but has not been 
declared so by the High Court or the Supreme Court. The Court has to state setting 
out its opinion and the reasons therefor, and refer the same for the decision of the 
High Court. The High Court passes such order as it deems fit and causes a copy of 
such order to be sent to the Court making the reference which shall dispose of the 
case conformably to the said order. The High Court may in its discretion exercise any 
of the powers conferred on a Court of Appeal by Sections 386, 389, 390 and 391 or 
on a Court of Session by Section 307 in the case of any proceeding the record of 
which has been called for by itself or which otherwise comes to its knowledge. If an 
appeal lies, but an applications for revision has been made to the High Court by any 
person and the High Court is satisfied that such application was made under the 
erroneous belief that no appeal lies thereto, the High Court may treat the application 
for revision as a petition of appeal and deal with the same accordingly. 
Under Section 438, provisions have been made for a person who has reason to 
believe that he may be arrested on an accusation of having committed a non-bailable 
offence, he may apply to the High Court  or the Court of Session for a direction and 
that Court may if it thinks fit direct that in the event of such arrest, the person shall be 
released on bail on such conditions which the Court may include in such directions.  
Bail may be taken when any person other than a person accused of a non-
bailable offence, is arrested or detained without warrant by an officer-in-charge of a 
police station or is brought before a Court, and is prepared at anytime while in 
custody or at any stage of the proceedings before such Court to give bail, such 
person shall be released on bail. Such police officer or the Court if it thinks fit may 
instead of taking bail from such person discharge him on executing a bond without 
sureties for his appearance as may be required (Section 436). In case any surety 
becomes insolvent or dies, the Court by whose order such bond was taken, or a 
Magistrate (First class) may order the person from whom such security was 
demanded to furnish, fresh security in accordance with the directions of the original 
order. (Section 447) 
16.  LIMITATION FOR TAKING COGNIZANCE OF CERTAIN OFFENCES 
In general, there is no limitation of time in filling complaints under the Code. But 
delay may hurdle the investigation. Further, the Indian Limitation Act provides the 
period of limitation for appeal and revision applications. Therefore, chapter XXXVI 
has been introduced in the Code prescribing limitation period for taking cognizance of 
certain offences. (Sections 467 to 473) 
Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Code, no Court shall 
take cognizance of an offence after the expiry of the period of 
limitation mentioned below: 
 
(a) six months, if the offence is punishable with fine only. 
 (b) one year, if the offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term not 
exceeding one year; and 
 
EP-GCL-9 
391 
 (c) three years, if the offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term 
exceeding one year but not exceeding three years. 
The period of limitation in relation to offences which may be tried together shall 
be determined with reference to the gravity of the offence where the punishment 
inflicted for such offence is more severe or the most severe. 
Commencement of the period of limitation 
The period in relation to an offender commences (a) on the date of the offence; 
(b) if the commission of the offence was not known to the person aggrieved or to the 
police officer, the first day on which either such offence comes to the knowledge of 
such person or to any police officer, whichever is earlier; (c) where the identity of the 
offender is not known, the first day on which such identity becomes known either to 
the person aggrieved or the police officer whichever is earlier. (Section 469) 
The object of Section 468 is to prescribe the period of limitation and the Court is 
enjoined not to take cognizance of an offence specified in sub-section (2) after the 
expiry of such period of limitaiton. The object is to prevent the parties from filing the 
case after a long time so that the material evidence may not vanish. Section 469 fixes 
the day from which the period of limitation should begin to run. However, Section 470 
provides provisions for exclusion of time in certain cases. These are as under: 
 (a) the period during which another prosecution was deligently prosecuted (the 
prosecution should relate to the same facts and is prosecuted in good faith); 
 (b) the period of the continuance of the stay order or injunction (from the date of 
grant to the date of withdrawal) granted against the institution of prosecution; 
 (c) where notice of prosecution has been given, the period of notice; 
 (d) where previous sanction or consent for the institution of any prosecution is 
necessary, the period required for obtaining such consent or sanction 
including the date of application for obtaining the sanction and the date of the 
receipt of the order; 
 (e) the period during which the offender is absent from India or from territory 
outside India under Central Govt. Administration; and 
 
(f) period when the offender is absconding or concealing himself. (Section 470) 
If limitation expires on a day when the Court is closed, cognizance can be taken 
on the day the Court re-opens. (Section 471) 
Continuing offence — In the case of a continuing offence, a fresh period of 
limitation begins to run at every moment during which the offence continues. (Section 
472) 
Extension of period of limitation — The Court may take cognizance of an offence 
after the expiry of the period of limitation if it is satisfied that (i) the delay is properly 
explained or (ii) it is necessary to do so in the interests of justice. (Section 473) 
17.  SUMMARY TRIALS 
Summary trial means the "speedy disposal" of cases. By summary cases is 
meant a case which can be tried and disposed of at once. Generally, it will apply to 
such offences not punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding two years. 
EP-GCL-9 
392 
? 
Section 260(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code sets out the 
provisions for summary trials. It says: 
 
(a) any Chief Judicial Magistrate; 
 (b) any Metropolitan Magistrate; 
 (c) any Magistrate of the First class who is specially empowered in this behalf by 
the High Court, may, if he thinks fit, try in a summary way all or any of the 
following offences: 
 
(i) offences not punishable with death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment 
for a term exceeding two years; 
 
(ii) theft under Section 379, Section 380 or Section 381 of the Indian Penal 
Code, where the value of the property stolen does not exceed Rs. 200; 
 
(iii) receiving or retaining stolen property, under Section 411 of the Indian 
Penal Code, where the value of such property, does not exceed Rs. 200; 
 
(iv) assisting in the concealment or disposal of stolen property, under Section 
414 of the Indian Penal Code, where the value of such property does not 
exceed Rs. 200; 
 
(v) offences under Sections 454 and 456 of the Indian Penal Code; 
 
(vi) insult with intent to provoke a breach of the peace, under Section 504 of

an offence; 
 
(ix) any offence constituted by an act in respect of which a complaint may be 
made under Section 20 of the Cattle Trespass Act, 1871. 
Sub-section (2) states that when in the course of a summary trial it appears to the 
Magistrate that the nature of the case is such that it is undesirable to try it summarily, 
the Magistrate shall recall any witnesses who may have been examined and proceed 
to re-hear the case in the manner provided in this Code. Summary trial is a speedy 
trial by dispensing with formalities or delay in proceedings. 
Section 262 envisages procedure for summary trials. Sub-section (1) lays down 
that in all summary trials the summons-case procedure should be followed 
irrespective of the nature of the case i.e. whether it is a summons-case or a warrant 
case. Sub-section (2) laying down the limit of the sentence of imprisonment states 
that no sentence of imprisonment for a term exceeding 3 months shall be passed in 
any conviction in summary trials.

LESSON ROUND-UP 
 
 
The law of criminal procedure is meant to be complimentary to criminal law. It is 
intended to provide a mechanism for the enforcement of criminal law. The Code 
of Criminal Procedure creates the necessary machinery for apprehending the 
criminals, investigating the criminal cases, their trials before the criminal courts 
and imposition of proper punishment on the guilty person. 
 
For the purpose of the Code all offences have been classified into different 
categories. Firstly, all offences are divided into two categories – cognizable 
offences and non-cognizable offences; secondly, offences are classified into 
bailable and non-bailable offences; and thirdly, the Code classifies all criminal 
cases into summons cases and warrant cases. 
 
The Code enumerates the hierarchy of criminal courts in which different offences 
can be tried and then it spells out the limits of sentences which such Courts are 
authorized to pass. 
 
The Code contemplates two types of arrests – (a) arrest with a warrant; and (b) 
arrest without a warrant. Where a person has been concerned in a non-
cognizable offence, he cannot, except in a few cases be arrested without a 
warrant. Powers to arrest without a warrant are mainly conferred on the police. 
The Code envisages the various circumstances under which a police officer may 
arrest a person without a warrant. 
 
Further, a private person may arrest or cause to be arrested any person who in 
his presence commits a non-bailable and cognizable offence or who is a 
proclaimed offender. Furthermore, the Magistrate has been given power to arrest 
a person who has committed an offence in his presence and also commit him to 
custody. 
 
Whether the arrest to be made is with a warrant or without a warrant, it is 
necessary that in making such an arrest, the police officer or other person making 
such an arrest actually touches or confines the body of the person to be arrested 
and such police officer or other person may use all necessary means to effect the 
arrest if there is forcible resistance.  
 
Persons arrested are to be taken before the Magistrate or officer-in-charge of a 
police station without unnecessary delay. When a person is arrested under a 
warrant, Section 76 becomes applicable, and when he is arrested without a 
warrant, he can be kept into custody for  period not exceeding 24 hours, and 
before the expiry of that period he is to be produced before the nearest 
Magistrate, who can order his detention for a term not exceeding 15 days, or he 
can be taken to a Magistrate, under whose jurisdiction he is to be tried, and such 
Magistrate can remand him to custody for a term which may exceed 15 days but 
not more than 60 days. 
 
EP-GCL-9 
395 
 
Every warrant of arrest issued by a Court under this Code shall be in writing, 
signed by the presiding officer of such Court, and shall bear the seal of the Court. 
Such warrant shall remain in force until it is cancelled by the Court which issued 
it, or until it is executed. Where a warrant remains unexecuted, the Code provides 
for two remedies (i) issuing a proclamation; and (ii) attachment and sale of 
property. 
 
The main processes for compelling production of things and documents are (a) 
summons issued by a court; (b) warrant order issued by a police officer in charge 
of a police station; (c) search and seizure with or without a warrant. These 
processes may be used – (i) for the investigation, inquiry or trial in respect of an 
offence; or (ii) for any other proceeding generally taken as a preventive or 
precautionary measure. 
 
Every information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence, if given 
orally to an officer in charge of a police station, shall be reduced to writing by him 
or under his direction and be read over to the informant. Every such information 
shall be signed by the person giving it and the substance thereof shall be entered 
in a book kept by such officer in such form as may be prescribed by the State 
Government in this behalf. The above information given to a police officer and 
reduced to writing is known as First Information Report (FIR). The investigation of 
the case proceeds on this information only. 
 
In case of a cognizable offence the police officer may conduct investigations 
without the order of a Magistrate. Investigation includes all proceedings under the 
Code for the collection of evidence by the police officer or by any person who is 
authorized by the Magistrate in this behalf. 
 
Any Magistrate of first class and of the second class specially empowered may 
take cognizance of an offence upon: (i) receiving a complaint of facts constituting 
such offence; (ii) a police report of such facts; (iii) information received from any 
person other than police officer; (iv) his own knowledge that such offence has 
been committed. 
 
The Court of Session does not take cognizance of any offence, as a Court of 
original jurisdiction unless the case has been committed to it by a competent 
Magistrate. No Court shall take cognizance of an offence after the expiry of the 
period of limitation. The object is to prevent the parties from filing the case after a 
long time so that the material evidence may not vanish.  
 
Summary trial means the ―speedy disposal‖ of cases. By summary cases is 
meant a case which can be tried and disposed of at once. Generally, it will apply 
to such offences not punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding two 
years. The kinds of offences that can be tried summarily have been stipulated 
under the Code. In every case tried summarily in which the accused does not 
plead guilty, the Magistrate shall record the substance of the evidence and a 
judgement containing a brief statement of the reason for the finding. The 
concerned Magistrate must sign such record and judgement.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Throughout the world, the right to information is seen by many as the key to 
strengthening 
participatory 
democracy 
and 
ensuring 
more 
people-centred 
development. Nearly 70 countries around the world have now adopted 
comprehensive Freedom of Information Acts to facilitate access to records held by 
government bodies and another fifty have pending efforts. In India also, the 
397 
EP-GCL-10 
398 
? 
Government enacted Right to Information (RTI) Act in 2005 which came into force 
w.e.f. October 12, 2005.  
RIGHT TO KNOW 
Before dwelling on the RTI Act, 2005, mention should be made that in 
R.P.Limited v Indian Express Newspapers, the Supreme Court read into Article 21 
the right to know. The Supreme Court held that right to know is a necessary 
ingredient of participatory democracy. In view of transnational developments when 
distances are shrinking, international communities are coming together for 
cooperation in various spheres and they are moving towards global perspective in 
various fields including Human Rights, the expression ―liberty‖ must receive an 
expanded meaning. The expression cannot be limited to mere absence of bodily 
restraint. It is wide enough to expand to full range of rights including right to hold a 
particular opinion and right to sustain and nurture that opinion. For sustaining and 
nurturing that opinion it becomes necessary to receive information. Article 21 confers 
on all persons a right to know which include a right to receive information.  
It may be pointed out that the right to impart and receive information is a species 
of the right to freedom of speech and expression. Article 19(1) (a) of our Constitution 
guarantees to all citizens freedom of speech and expression. At the same time, 
Article 19(2) permits the State to make any law in so far as such law imposes 
reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the rights conferred by Article 19(1) (a) of 
the constitution in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the 
State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency, morality, contempt 
of court, defamation and incitement of offence.  
Thus, a citizen has a right to receive information and that right is derived from the 
concept of freedom of speech and expression comprised in Article 19(1) (a). The 
State is not only under an obligation to respect the Fundamental Rights of the 
citizens, but it is equally under an obligation to ensure conditions under which these 
rights can meaningfully and effectively be enjoyed by one and all.  
Right to freedom of speech and expression in Art.19 (1)(a) carries with it the right 
to propagate and circulate one‘s views and opinions subject to reasonable restrictions 
as mentioned above. The prerequisite for enjoying this right is knowledge and 
information. Information adds something ―new to our awareness and removes 
vagueness of our ideas‖.

answering the response sheets have also been brought to the Institute‘s 
notice. The Training and Educational Facilities Committee has viewed 
seriously such instances of using unfair means to complete postal coaching. 
The students are, therefore, strongly advised to write response sheets 
personally in their own hand-writing without copying from any original source. It 
is also brought to the notice of all students that use of any malpractice in 
undergoing postal or oral coaching is a misconduct as provided in the 
explanation to Regulation 27 and accordingly the studentship registration of 
such students is liable to be cancelled or terminated. The text of regulation 27 
is reproduced below for information:

necessary and after giving such student or candidate an opportunity to state 
his case, suspend or debar the person from appearing in any one or more 
examinations, cancel his examination result, or studentship registration, or
