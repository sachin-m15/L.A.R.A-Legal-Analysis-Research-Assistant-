EXECUTIVE PROGRAMME 
ECONOMIC, BUSINESS AND COMMERCIAL LAWS  
 
India redrafted its economic policy to usher in a new era of deregulation, liberalisation and global 
integration. Since then significant policy initiatives have been introduced, to provide stimulus for 
accelerated growth, industrial efficiency and international competitiveness. As part of reform process, the 
Government has also initiated legislative reforms in the area of Economic, Business and Commercial 
laws. The Government enacted Foreign Exchange Management Act, The Competition Act, 2002, Real 
Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 and amended Benami Transaction Prohibitions Act. 
Further, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act to deal with new categories of economic offences, has 
also been enacted. Similarly, in the area of consumer protection and business laws, the process of 
reforms is going on. 
In the light of above developments, this study material has been prepared to provide an 
understanding of certain Economic, Business and Commercial legislations which have direct bearing on 
the functioning of companies. The study material has been divided into three parts consisting of twenty 
four study lessons.  Part I dealing with Foreign Exchange Management & NBFCs consists of Study 
Lessons I to XI, whereas Part II dealing with Competition Laws consists of Study Lesson XIIand Part III 
dealing with Business & Commercial Laws consists of Study Lessons XIII to XXIV. 
This study material has been published to aid the students in preparing for the Economic, Business 
and Commercial Laws paper of the CS Executive Programme. It has been prepared to provide basic 
understanding of some of the Economic, Business and Commercial laws thereunder, which have a 
bearing on the conduct of corporate affairs. It is part of the educational kit and takes the students step by 
step through each phase of preparation stressing key concepts, principle, pointers and procedures. 
Company Secretaryship being a professional course, the examination standards are set very high, with 
emphasis on knowledge of concepts, applications, procedures and case laws, for which sole reliance on 
the contents of this study material may not be enough. Besides, as per the Company Secretaries 
Regulations, 1982, students are expected to be conversant with the amendments to the laws made upto 
six months preceding the date of examination. The material may, therefore, be regarded as the basic 
material and must be read alongwith the original Bare Acts, Rules, Regulations, Case Law, Chartered  
Secretary Journal published by the Institute every month . 
The subject of Economic, Business and Commercial Laws is inherently complicated and is subjected 
to constant refinement through new primary legislations, rules and regulations made thereunder and court 
decisions on specific legal issues. It, therefore becomes necessary for every student to constantly update 
himself with the various legislative changes made as well as judicial pronouncements rendered from time 
to time by referring to the Institute’s journal ‘Chartered Secretary’ and e-bulletin  as well as other 
law/professional journals. 
In the event of any doubt, students may write to the Directorate of Professional Development, 
Perspective Planning & Studies of the Institute for clarification at academics@icsi.edu. 
Although care has been taken in publishing this study material yet the possibility of errors, omissions 
and/or discrepancies cannot be ruled out. This publication is released with an understanding that the 
Institute shall not be responsible for any errors, omissions and/or discrepancies or any action taken in that 
behalf. 
Should there be any discrepancy, error or omission noted in the study material, the Institute shall be 
obliged if the same is brought to its notice for issue of corrigendum in the e-bulletin.

Lesson 17 -  Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 
Parliament enacted the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 which aims at protecting the 
rights  and interests of consumers  and  promotion  of  uniformity  and standardization  of  business  
practices  and transactions in the real estate sector. It attempts to balance the interests of consumers and 
promoters by imposing certain responsibilities on both.  It seeks to establish symmetry of information 
between the promoter and purchaser, transparency of contractual conditions, set minimum standards of 
accountability and a fast-track dispute resolution mechanism. 
As per Section 56 of the Act, the applicant or appellant may either appear in person or authorise one or 
more chartered accountants  or company  secretaries or  cost  accountants  or  legal  practitioners  or  
any  of  its  officers  to  present  his  or  its case before the Appellate Tribunal or the Regulatory Authority 
or the adjudicating officer, as the case may be. 
The objective of the lesson is to introduce the students regarding: 
• Registration of Real Estate Project; 
• Real Estate Agents; 
• Real Estate Regulatory Authority; 
• The Real Estate Appellate Tribunal; and  
• Specimen Agreement for Sale between the Promoter and the Allottee; Due Diligence Reporting. 
ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS 
Lesson 18 - Benami Transaction Prohibitions (Act) 
Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 defines benami transaction and benami property and also 
provides for exclusions and transactions which shall not be construed benami. The  legislation  is  also  
intended  to  effectively  prohibit  benami  transactions  and  consequently  prevent circumvention of law 
through unfair practices. It empowers the Government to confiscate benami property by following due 
procedure. It therefore promotes equity across all citizens. 
The purpose of this lesson is to provide the students with: 
• Benami Property; 
• Benami Transaction; 
• Prohibition of Benami Transaction; and 
• Adjudication of Benami property. 
Lesson 19 - Prevention of Money Laundering 
The possible social and political costs of money laundering, if left unchecked or dealt with ineffectively, 
are serious.  Organised crime can infiltrate financial institutions, acquire control of large sectors of the 
economy through investment, or offer bribes to public officials and indeed governments.  The economic 
 
(xviii) 
and political influence of criminal organisations can weaken the social  fabric,  collective  ethical  
standards,  and  ultimately  the  democratic  institutions  of  society. In countries transitioning to 
democratic systems, this criminal influence can undermine the transition.  Most  fundamentally,  money 
laundering  is  inextricably  linked  to  the  underlying  criminal  activity  that  generated  it.  Laundering 
enables criminal activity to continue. 
The Prevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002 enacted to prevent money laundering and to provide for 
confiscation of property derived from, or involved in, money laundering and for matters connected 
therewith or incidental thereto. 
The objective of the lesson is to introduce the students regarding: 
• Problem and adverse effect of money laundering; 
• Methods of money laundering; 
• Offence of money laundering; and  
• Attachment, adjudication and confiscation. 
BUSINESS LAWS 
Lesson 20 - Indian Contracts Act, 1872 
The Law of Contract constitutes the most important branch of Mercantile or Commercial Law. It affects 
everybody, more so, trade, commerce and industry. It may be said that the contract is the foundation of 
the modern world. The Indian Contract Act, 1872 regulates all the transactions of a company. 
• It lays down the general principles relating to  the  formation  and enforceability  of  contracts; rules  
governing  the provisions  of  an  agreement  and  offer; 
• Various types of contracts including those of indemnity and guarantee, bailment and pledge and 
agency; and 
• It also contains provisions pertaining to breach of a contract. 
Lesson 21 - Specific Relief Act, 1963 
The Specific Relief Act, 1963 was enacted to define and amend the law relating to certain kinds of 
specific relief. It contains provisions, inter alia, specific performance of contracts, contracts not specifically 
enforceable, parties who may obtain and against whom specific performance may be obtained, etc. It also 
confers wide discretionary powers upon the courts to decree specific performance and to refuse 
injunction, etc. 
It is expected that, at the end of this lesson, students will, inter alia, be in a position to:  
• Understand specific reliefs and defense; 
• Specific performance and defense; 
• Unenforceable contracts; and 
• Know Decrees and Preventive Reliefs. 
Lesson 22-Sale of Goods Act, 1930 
The law relating to sale of goods is contained in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. In  a  sale,  the  property  in  
(xix) 
the  goods  sold  passes  to  the  buyer  at  the  time  of  contract  so  that  he becomes the owner of the 
goods. In an agreement to sell, the ownership does not pass to the buyer at the time of the contract, but it 
passes only when it becomes sale on the expiry of certain time or the fulfillment of some conditions 
subject to which the property in the goods is to be transferred. 
The purpose of this lesson is to provide the students with:  
• Essentials of a Contract of Sale; 
• Sale Distinguished from Agreement to Sell; 
• Bailment; 
• Conditions and Warranties; and 
• Doctrine of Caveat Emptor. 
Lesson 23 - Partnership Act, 1932 
"Partnership" is the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried 
on by all or any of them acting for all. Persons who have entered into partnership with one another are 
called individually, "partners" and collectively "a firm", and the name under which their business is carried 
on is called the "firm-name”. In determining whether a group of persons is or is not a firm, or whether a 
person is or is not a partner in a firm, regard shall be had to the real relation between the parties, as 
shown by all relevant facts taken together. 
It is expected that, at the end of this lesson, students will, inter alia, be in a position to:  
• Understand Rights and Liabilities of Partners; 
• Registration of Firms; 
• Admission of new partners; and 
• Dissolution of Firms and Partnership. 
Lesson 24 - Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 
A negotiable instrument may be defined as an instrument, the property in which is acquired by anyone 
who takes it bona fide, and for value, notwithstanding any defect of title in the person from whom he took 
it, from which it follows that an instrument cannot be negotiable unless it is such and in such a state that 
the true owner could transfer the contract or engagement contained therein by simple delivery of 
instrument. 
The objective of the lesson is to introduce the students regarding: 
• Negotiable Instruments and Parties; 
• Effect of Negotiability; 
• Crossing and bouncing of Cheques; 
• Dishonour of Cheques & its Remedies; and 
• Presumption of Law as to Negotiable Instruments.

INTRODUCTION 
The origin of the Reserve Bank of India can be traced back to 1926, when the Royal Commission on Indian 
Currency and Finance – also known as the Hilton-Young Commission – recommended the creation of a 
central bank for India to separate the control of currency and credit from the Government and to augment 
banking facilities throughout the country. The Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 established the Reserve Bank 
and set in motion a series of actions culminating in the start of operations in 1935. Since then, the Reserve 
Bank’s role and functions have undergone numerous changes, as the nature of Indian economy and financial 
sector changed. 
Starting as a private shareholders’ bank, the Reserve Bank was nationalized in 1949. It then assumed the 
responsibility to meet the aspirations of a newly independent country and its people. The Reserve Bank’s 
nationalisation aimed at achieving coordination between the policies of the government and those of central 
bank. 
The Preamble to the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (the Act), under which it was constituted, specifies its 
objective as “to regulate the issue of Bank notes and the keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary 
stability in India and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its advantage”. 
The objectives outlined in the Preamble hold good. As evident from the multifaceted functions that the 
Reserve Bank performs today, its role and priorities have, changed in tandem with national priorities and 
global developments. Essentially, the Reserve Bank has demonstrated dynamism and flexibility to meet the 
requirements of an evolving economy. 
A core function of the Reserve Bank in the past years has been the formulation and implementation of 
monetary policy with the objective of maintaining price stability and ensuring adequate flow of credit to 
productive sectors of the economy. To these was added, in more recent times, the goal of maintaining 
financial stability. The objective of maintaining financial stability has spanned its role from external account 
management to oversight of banks and non-banking financial institutions as also of money, government 
securities and foreign exchange markets. 
The Reserve Bank designs and implements the regulatory policy framework for banking and non-banking 
financial institutions with the aim of providing people access to the banking system, protecting depositors’ 
interest, and maintaining overall health of the financial system. Its function of regulating the commercial 
banking sector, which emerged with the enactment of Banking Regulation Act, 1949, has over the time, 
expanded to cover other entities. Thus, amendments to Banking Regulation Act, 1949 brought cooperative 
banks and regional rural banks under the Reserve Bank’s jurisdiction, while amendments to the Reserve 
Bank of India Act saw development finance institutions, non-banking financial companies and primary 
dealers coming under its regulation, as these entities became important players in the financial system and 
markets. 
Similarly, the global economic uncertainties during and after the Second World War warranted conservation 
of scarce foreign exchange reserves by sovereign intervention and allocation. Initially, the Reserve Bank 
carried out regulation of foreign exchange transactions under the Defence of India Rules, 1939 and later, 
under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act of 1947. Over the years, as the economy matured, the role 
shifted from foreign exchange regulation to foreign exchange management. 
Post-independence, as the emerging nation tried to meet the aspirations of a large and diversified populace, 
the Reserve Bank, with its experience and expertise, was entrusted with a variety of developmental roles, 
particularly in the field of credit delivery. With the onset of economic planning in 1950-51, the Reserve Bank 
undertook a variety of developmental functions to encourage savings and capital formation and widen and 
deepen the agricultural and industrial credit set-up. Institution building was a significant aspect of its role in 
the sixties and the seventies. The strategy for nearly four decades placed emphasis on the state-induced or 
state-supported developmental efforts. Subsequently, the role of financial sector and financial markets was 
                                                                         Lesson 1          Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934

also given an explicit recognition in the development strategy. 
The aftermath of 1991 balance of payments and foreign exchange crisis saw a paradigm shift in India’s 
economic and financial policies. The approach under the reform era included a thrust towards liberalisation, 
privatisation, globalisation and concerted efforts at strengthening the existing and emerging institutions and 
market participants. The Reserve Bank adopted international best practices in areas, such as, prudential 
regulation, banking technology, variety of monetary policy instruments, external sector management and 
currency management to make the new policy framework effective. 
The rapid pace of growth achieved by the financial system in deregulated regime necessitated a deepening 
and widening of access to banking services. The new millennium has seen the Reserve Bank play an active 
role in balancing the relationship between banks and customers; focusing on financial inclusion; setting up 
administrative machinery to handle customer grievances; pursuing clean note policy and ensuring 
development and oversight of secure and robust payment and settlement systems. 
The last two-and-a-half decades have also seen growing integration of national economy and financial 
system with the globalising world. While rising global integration has its advantages in terms of expanding 
the scope and scale of growth of the Indian economy, it also exposes India to global shocks. Hence, 
maintaining financial stability became an important mandate for the Reserve Bank. This, in turn, has brought 
forth the need for effective coordination and consultation with other regulators within the country and abroad.

ESTABLISHMENT AND INCORPORATION OF RESERVE BANK 
Section 3 of the RBI Act states that a bank to be called the Reserve Bank of India shall be constituted for the 
purposes of taking over the management of the currency from the Central Government and of carrying on 
the business of banking in accordance with the provisions of the Act. 
Sub section (2) of this section provides that the Bank shall be a body corporate by the name of Reserve 
Bank of India, having perpetual succession and a common seal, and shall by the said name sue and be 
sued. 
ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE & MANAGEMENT 
 
The organizational structure of RBI can be classified under the following designations: 
  
 
 
         Central Board of Directors 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CENTRAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
The Central Board of Directors is at the top of the Reserve Bank’s organisational structure. Appointed by the 
Government under the provisions of Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Central Board has the primary 
authority and responsibility for the oversight of Reserve Bank. It delegates specific functions to the Local 
Boards and various committees. The Governor is the Reserve Bank’s chief executive.  
                                                                         Lesson 1          Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934                                   
5 
The Governor supervises and directs the affairs and business of RBI. The management team also includes 
Deputy Governors and Executive Directors.  
The Central Government nominates fourteen Directors on the Central Board, including one Director each 
from the four Local Boards. The other ten Directors represent different sectors of the economy, such as, 
agriculture, industry, trade, and professions. All these appointments are made for a period of four years. The 
Government also nominates one Government official as a Director representing the Government, who is 
usually the Finance Secretary to the Government of India and remains on the Board ‘during the pleasure of 
the Central Government’.  
The Governor and Deputy Governors devote their whole time to the affairs of the Bank, and receive such 
salaries and allowances as may be determined by the Central Board, with the approval of the Central 
Government [Section 8(2)] 
The Deputy Governor and the Director nominated may attend any meeting of the Central Board and take 
part in its deliberations but shall not be entitled to vote. However when the Governor is, for any reason, 
unable to attend any such meeting, a Deputy Governor authorized by him in this behalf in writing may vote 
for him at that meeting. [Section 8(3)] 
The Governor and a Deputy Governor hold the office for such term not exceeding five years as the Central 
Government may fix when appointing them, and they are eligible for re-appointment. A Director nominated 
holds the office for a period of four years and thereafter until his successor is nominated. [Section 8(4)] 
No act or proceeding of the Board can be questioned on the ground merely of the existence of any vacancy 
in, or any defect in the constitution, of the board. [Section 8(5)] 
A retiring director shall be eligible for re-nomination. [Section 8(7)] 
Local Boards 
The Reserve Bank Governor and a maximum of four Deputy Governors are also ex officio Directors on the 
Central Board. The Reserve Bank also has four Local Boards, constituted by the Central Government under 
the RBI Act, one each for the Western, Eastern, Northern and Southern areas of the country, which are 
located in Mumbai, Kolkata, New Delhi and Chennai. Each of these Boards has five members appointed by 
the Central Government for a term of four years and thereafter until his successor is appointed. They are 
eligible for re-appointment [Section 9(3)]. The members of the Local Board shall elect from amongst 
themselves one person to be the Chairman of the Board. [Section 9(2)]. These Boards represent territorial 
and economic interests of their respective areas, and advise the Central Board on matters, such as, issues 
relating to local cooperative and indigenous banks. They also perform other functions that the Central Board 
may delegate to them. [Section 9(1)] 
Offices and Branches 
The Reserve Bank has a network of offices and branches through which it discharges its responsibilities. The 
units operating in the four metros — Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi and Chennai — are known as offices, while the 
units located at other cities and towns are called branches. Currently, the Reserve Bank has its offices, 
including branches, at 27 locations in India. The offices and larger branches are headed by a senior officer of 
the rank of Chief General Manager, designated as Regional Director while smaller branches are headed by a 
senior officer of the rank of General Manager.

FUNCTIONS OF THE RESERVE BANK 
The statutes governing the establishment and mandates of central banks play a crucial role in  determining  
their functions across the world.  The RBI has been constituted under the Reserve Bank of India (RBI Act, 
1934).  The legal backing for the functions  of  the RBI is not only confined  to the provisions of the RBI  Act, 
but also spread over a number of statutes, such as the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, Foreign Exchange 
Management Act, 1999, Government Securities  Act,  2006,  Payment  and  Settlement  Systems  Act,  2007,  
etc. 
The purposes for which the Reserve Bank of India established as India's central bank have been spelt out in 
the preamble to the RBI Act, which states as follows: 
 
(i) to regulate the issue of banknotes and the keeping of reserves with a view to  securing monetary  
stability in India and generally  to  operate the currency  and  credit system of  the country to its 
advantage; and 
 
(ii)  that it  is essential to have a modern monetary policy framework  to  meet the challenge  of  an  
increasingly complex  economy: the  primary  objective of the monetary policy is  to maintain price 
stability while keeping in mind the objective of  growth and the monetary policy framework in India 
shall be operated by the Reserve Bank of India . 
The functions of the Reserve Bank of India can be summarized as under: 
 Banking Functions 
 Issue bank notes 
 Monetary Policy Functions 
 Public Debt Functions 
 Foreign Exchange Management 
 Banking Regulation & Supervision 
 Regulation and Supervision of NBFCs 
 Regulation & Supervision of Co-operative banks 
 Regulation of Derivatives and Money Market Instruments 
 Payment and Settlement Functions 
 Consumer Protection Functions 
 Financial Inclusion and Development Functions 
Banking Functions 
The general superintendence and direction of the affairs and business of RBI is entrusted to Central Board 
having nominees from the Central Government and Directors appointed under Section 8 of the RBI Act. The 
Board of RBI is headed by the Governor and assisted by not more than four Deputy Governors.  
The  Board exercises all powers and does  all  acts  and  things  which  may  be exercised  by  the  RBI.  
Section 17 of the RBI Act  enables RBI to do banking business, such as accepting deposits, without  interest, 
from any person. The other businesses, which the RBI may transact, are also mentioned in the said 
                                                                         Lesson 1          Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934

provision. It states that RBI may transact various businesses such as acceptance of deposits without interest 
from Central Government and State Governments, purchase, sale and rediscount of Bills of Exchange, short 
term Loans and Advances to banks, annual Contributions to National Rural Credit Funds, dealing in 
Derivatives, purchase and sale of Government Securities, purchase and sale of shares of  State Bank of  
India, National Housing Bank, Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation, etc., keeping of 
deposits with  SBI  for  specific purposes, making  and issue of Banknotes, etc. 
Similarly, Section 18 facilitates the RBI to  act as a 'Lender of  Last Resort'; whereas Section 19 states the 
list of  businesses which the RBI may not transact.  This apart, the provisions of RBI Act enables the RBI to 
act as banker to Central Government and State Governments. Under Sections 20 and 21 the RBI shall  have 
an obligation and right respectively to accept monies for account of Central Government and to make 
payments up  to  the amount standing to the credit of its account, and to carry out its exchange, remittance 
and other banking operations, including the management of public debt of the Union. In the case of State 
Governments, the said banking functions may be undertaken by way of an agreement between RBI and the 
State Government concerned as provided in Section 21-A of RBI Act. These agreements made between the 
RBI and the  State  Governments are statutory  as  they are required to be laid before the Parliament as  
soon as they are made. 
Issue Functions 
Right to issue bank notes is one of the key central banking functions of the RBI. Section 22 of RBI Act 
confers RBI with sole right to issue bank notes in India.  The issue function of bank notes is performed by the 
Issue Department, which is separated and kept wholly distinct from Banking Department. The RBI Act 
enables the RBI to recommend to Central Government the denomination of bank notes, i.e. two rupees, five 
rupees, ten rupees, twenty rupees, fifty rupees, one hundred rupees, five hundred rupees, one thousand 
rupees, two thousand rupees, five thousand rupees and ten thousand rupees or other denominations not 
exceeding ten thousand rupees. 
The design, form and material of bank notes is approved by Central Government on the recommendations of 
Central Board of the RBI. Every bank note is a legal tender at any place in India, however, on 
recommendation of the Central  Board, the  Central Government may declare  any  series  of  bank notes of  
any  denomination as not to be  a  legal  tender.  Another important function is exchange of mutilated or torn 
notes, which under the RBI Act is not a matter of right, but a matter of grace. The bank notes  that are being 
issued by RBI are exempt from  payment of stamp  duty . 
Monetary Policy Function 
Chapter III-F of the RBI Act provides a statutory basis for Monetary Policy Framework and the Monetary 
Policy Committee (MPC).  The Central Government, in consultation with the RBI shall determine the inflation 
target in terms of the Consumer Price Index, once in every five years, which needs to be notified in the 
Official Gazette. Similarly, it is the Central Government that should constitute a Monetary Policy Committee 
by notification in the Official Gazette. 
The Monetary Policy Committee consists of 
 
(a) the Governor  of the RBI; 
 
(b) Deputy Governor of the RBI in charge of Monetary Policy; 
 
(c) one officer of the RBI to be  nominated by the Central Board; and 
 
(d) three  persons  to  be  appointed  by  the  Central  Government . 
EP-EBCL 
8 
The Monetary Policy Committee has been entrusted with the statutory duty to determine the Policy Rate 
required to achieve the inflation target.  The decision of the Monetary Policy Committee is binding on RBI 
and the RBI is required publish a document explaining the steps to be taken to implement the decisions of 
the Monetary Policy Committee.  The meetings of the MPC are required to be held at least 4 times a  year 
and its decisions to be published after each meeting. 
Public Debt Functions 
The Parliament of India enacted the Government Securities Act, 2006 ('GS Act') with  an  objective to 
consolidate and amend the law relating to Government securities and its management by the  Reserve Bank 
of  India.  The GS Act applies to Government securities created and issued by the Central Government or a 
State Government. The GS Act prescribes the procedure and modalities to be followed by RBI in the 
management of public debt and also confers various powers on RBI including the power to determine the 
title to a Government security if there exists any doubt in the opinion of RBI.  Further, Section 18 of the GS 
Act provides that no order made by RBI under this Act shall be called in question by any Court for the 
reasons stated therein. Prior to the enactment of GS Act, the said public debt functions of the RBI have been 
governed under the provisions of Public Debt Act, 1944. However, the enactment of the GS Act has not fully 
repealed the Public Debt Act, 1944.  This is evident from  Section 31 of  the GS Act which states that the 
Public Debt Act, 1944, shall cease to apply to the Government securities to which this Act (GS Act) applies. 
Foreign Exchange Management 
The powers and responsibilities with respect to external trades and payments, development  and  
maintenance of foreign exchange market in India have been conferred on RBI under the provisions of 
Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 ('FEMA').  Section 10 of the FEMA empowers the RBI to authorize 
any person to be known as authorized person to deal in foreign exchange or in foreign securities, as an 
authorized dealer, money changer or off-shore banking unit or in any other manner as it deems fit. Similarly, 
FEMA empowers the RBI to revoke an authorization issued to an authorized dealer in  public interest, or if 
the authorized person has failed to comply with the conditions subject to which the authorization was granted 
or has contravened any of the  provisions of the FEMA or any rule, regulation, notification, direction or order 
issued by the RBI. However, the revocation of an authorization may be done by the RBI after following the 
prescribed procedure in FEMA or the Regulations made thereunder.  Section 13 of the FEMA details out the 
contraventions and penalties, and the  RBI has been  empowered with the power to compound  such 
contraventions under Section 15 of the FEMA. 
Banking Regulation & Supervision 
The  power to regulate and supervise banks has been  provided to RBI under the provisions of Banking  
Regulation Act, 1949 (BR Act, 1949). Although, the preamble to the BR Act, 1949, states that it is  an Act to 
consolidate and amend the law relating to banking, the powers of RBI to formulate banking policy, regulate 
banking business, protect the interests  of banking companies, supervision of banking companies, etc., are 
spread across the provisions of BR Act, 1949. 
Firstly, Section 5(ca) of the BR  Act, 1949, states that banking policy means any policy, which is specified 
from time to time by the RBI, in the interest of banking system or in the interest of monetary stability or sound 
economic growth, having due regard to the interests of the depositors, the volume of deposits and other 
resources of the bank and the need for equitable allocation and  the  efficient use of these deposits and 
resources.  
Secondly, as a  part of RBI's regulatory power, Section 10BB of the BR Act, 1949 empowers RBI to appoint a 
                                                                         Lesson 1          Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934                                   
9 
Chairman or Managing Director of  a banking company for the reasons stated therein.  Similarly, as a part of 
control over management, Section 36-AB of BR Act, 1949, provides for power to appoint additional directors 
on the boards of banking companies. Not only the powers to  appoint managerial persons but also the power 
to remove them are vested with the RBI under Section 36-AA of the BR  Act, 1949.  Moreover, the  RBI has 
been empowered, to supersede the board of  banking companies.  
Though the business of banking is within the domain of a banking company, the power to control advances 
by banking companies is also provided to RBI under Section 21 of the BR Act, 1949. Similarly, Section 22 of 
the BR Act, 1949 confers on RBI the power to issue license and also to cancel licenses of banking 
companies. Another important regulatory power that has been vested with the RBI is to issue directions to 
banking companies. Under Section 35-A of BR Act, 1949, RBI has the power to issue directions to banking 
companies in the public interest or in the interest of banking policy or to prevent the affairs of any banking 
company being conducted in a manner detrimental to the interests of the depositors or in a manner 
prejudicial to the interests of banking company or to secure the proper management of any banking 
company.  
In this regard, it may be worthwhile to note the observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the 
case of Joseph Kuruvilla v.  Reserve Bank of India {AIR 1962 SC 1373} that in view of history of 
establishment of the Reserve Bank, as a Central Bank for India, its position as a banker's bank, its control 
over the banking companies and banking in India, its position as an issuing bank, its power to license the 
banking companies and cancel their licence and the numerous other powers, it is unanswerable that 
between the Court and the Reserve Bank, the momentous decision to wind up a tottering or unsafe banking 
company in  the interest of the depositors, may reasonably be left to the Reserve  Bank. 
The provisions of the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2017, provides for dealing with cases relating to 
stressed assets. Stressed assets are loans where the borrower has defaulted in repayment or where the 
loan has been restructured, etc.  In terms of Sections 35-AA and 35-AB of the BR Act, 1949, the RBI has 
been specifically authorized to issue directions to banking companies for resolution of stressed assets.  As  a 
part of the supervisory power, the RBI has  been empowered to inspect banking companies on its own or at 
the instance of Central Government under the provisions of the  BR Act, 1949 .In so far as the regulatory and 
supervisory powers of  the RBI over the  public sector banks including the State Bank of India and the 
Regional Rural Banks are concerned, in addition to the provisions available in  the respective Special Acts, 
the provisions as stated in Section 51 of the BR Act shall also be  applicable. Thus an overall responsibility to 
find out the well-being of a banking company, in improving monetary stability and economic growth as well 
as keeping in view the interests of depositors, has been  left  with the Reserve Bank of India. 
Regulation and Supervision of NBFCs 
The regulation and supervision of non-banking financial companies is one of the critical functions that the 
RBI has been entrusted with. Section 45-IA of RBI Act mandates every non-banking  financial  company  to  
obtain  a  certificate  of  registration  from  the  RBI and to maintain net owned fund  as may be specified by 
the RBI in  the Official Gazette, before commencing such non-banking financial  business .  Further, as part 
of regulation and supervision of non-banking financial companies, the RBI has been conferred with  the  
statutory  powers  to  regulate  or  prohibit  issue  of  prospectus  or advertisements  soliciting  deposits  of  
money by non-banking financial companies, power to  determine policy  and  issue directions to  non-
banking financial  companies,  etc.  Further, the RBI has been empowered under Section 45-L of the RBI Act 
to call for information and issue directions to non-banking financial companies for the reasons stated therein. 
As a part of the supervisory control over the non-banking financial companies, the RBI has powers to inspect 
them under Section 45-N of RBI Act, 1934. The RBI shall  exercise  all these  powers  in  the  public interest 
EP-EBCL 
10 
or to  regulate the financial system of the country to its  advantage or to prevent the affairs of any non-
banking financial company being conducted in a manner detrimental to the interest of the depositors or in a 
manner prejudicial to he interest of the non-banking financial company. This makes it clear that the power of 
RBI to regulate and supervise banking companies emanates from the provisions of BR Act whereas the 
powers to regulate and supervise non-banking financial companies has the source from RBI Act. 
Regulation & Supervision of Co-operative banks  
Regulation and supervision of urban co-operative banks is another area the RBI has been entrusted with. In 
terms of Article 246 of the Constitution of India, the exercise of legislative powers of the Union and the State 
are given in the Union List and the State List, i.e. List I and II respectively of the VII Schedule to the 
Constitution. The entry relating to Cooperative Societies fall in State List whereas the entry relating to 
banking falls in the Union List.  These results in the duality of jurisdiction over cooperative banks both by the 
Reserve Ban of India, in terms of Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and the Registrar of Cooperative Societies, 
in terms of the respective State Cooperative Societies Act, of the State concerned. Section 56 of the BR Act, 
1949, makes it applicable to co-operative societies involved in the business of banking. As a part of the 
regulatory and supervisory regime over co-operative banks, the RBI has been entrusted with the powers to 
issue licenses and cancel licenses of co-operative banks, supersede their boards, inspect them and also 
issue directions to them in the public interest, interest of banking policy, control over loans  and advances, 
etc. 
In Janata Sahakari Bank Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra (AIR 1993 Bombay 252) Hon'ble Bombay High Court 
has held that though the control over management of Co-operative Society where  it  is  Cooperative Banking 
Society or otherwise is vested in the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, but insofar as banking is  
concerned, by virtue of S.56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, read with S.35A of the Banking Regulation 
Act, 1949, it  will be a subject with which the Reserve Bank  of India  has full power. 
Regulation of Derivatives and Money Market Instruments 
Chapter III-D was inserted in the RBI Act with effect from 9th January 2007 by way of an amendment to the 
RBI Act, 1934. In the said chapter, the Parliament of India thought it appropriate to introduce provisions 
relating to regulation of transactions relating to derivatives, money market instruments, securities, etc. by the 
RBI. Sub-section (a)  of Section 45U of RBI Act defines derivative as an instrument to be settled at a future 
date, whose value is derived from change in interest  rate, foreign exchange rate, credit rating or  credit 
index, price of securities (also called 'underlying'), or a combination of more than one of them and includes 
interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements, foreign currency swaps, foreign currency-rupee swaps, foreign 
currency options, foreign currency rupee  options or such other instruments as may be specified by the RBI 
from time to time. Similarly, money market instruments have been defined to include call or notice money, 
term money, repo, reverse repo, certificate of deposit, commercial paper and such other debt instrument of 
original or initial maturity up to one year as the RBI may specify from time to time. The powers of RBI to 
regulate money market instruments have been provided under Section 45W of the RBI Act, which  states 
that the RBI may specify from time to time, in public interest or  to regulate the financial system of the country 
to its advantage, determine the policy relating to interest rates or interest rate products and give directions in 
that behalf to all agencies or any of them, dealing in securities, money market instruments, foreign exchange, 
derivatives, or other instruments of like nature. 
Payment and Settlement Functions 
The Parliament of India enacted the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 ('PSS  Act,  2007') with an 
objective to  provide for the regulation and supervision of payment systems in India and to designate 
                                                                         Lesson 1          Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934                                   
11 
Reserve Bank of India as the authority for that purpose and for matters connected therewith or incidental 
thereto.  Under Section 4 of the PSS Act, 2007, no person shall commence or operate a payment system 
except with an authorization issued by the RBI. 
Similarly, under Section 8 of the PSS Act, 2007, RBI has the powers to revoke the authorization granted to 
any person if it contravenes any of the provisions of PSS Act or does not comply with the regulations or fails 
to comply with the orders or directions issued by the RBI or operates the payment system contrary to the 
conditions subject to which the authorization was issued. The regulation and supervision of payment systems 
has been conferred on the RBI by virtue of provisions of Chapter IV f PSS Act, 2007.  The regulatory and 
supervisory controls include the power to  determine standards for the functioning of payment systems, 
power to call for returns, documents or other information, power to enter and inspect payment systems, 
power  to  carry  out  audit  and  inspections , power  to  issue  directions, etc. 
Consumer Protection Functions 
In India, although the provisions of the BR Act, 1949, requires the RBI to bear in mind the vital issue of 
protection of depositors' interests while granting a banking license or cancellation thereof, giving directions 
on advances o  on any banking matter, applying for suspension, winding up, or amalgamation of banks, 
approving appointment of CEOs or additional directors, removal of CEOs, etc., there is no specific provision 
under the BR Act, 1949, or any of the other statutes for forming a formal mechanism for redressal of 
grievances of depositors. In the absence of a specific provision for the purpose, RBI has resorted to its 
powers under Section 35-A of the BR  Act, 1949, to formulate the Banking Ombudsman Scheme for the 
redressal of grievances of depositors. 
Financial Inclusion and Development Functions 
The mushrooming of unauthorized and unregulated money lenders in the financial system of the country 
necessitated the RBI to do something more than what has been provided in the Rule books. Financial 
literacy or financial inclusion, though, not explicitly expressed in the RBI Act, 1934, or the BR Act, 1949, sub-
section (16) of Section 17 of the RBI Act, 1934, enables RBI to do all such matters and things as may be 
incidental to or consequential to the exercise of its powers or the discharge of its duties under the Act. 
Further, India being a country with significant illiteracy, there remains an obligation on the part of the 'State' 
to educate the people and also to include them into the organised financial system of the country to get the 
benefits of professional banking system of the country.  The  amendment to the BR Act, 1949, inserting 
Section  26-A is a step towards achieving this objective, which makes it amply clear that the statute casts  a 
responsibility on the RBI to focus towards  achieving financial  literacy in the country. Not only the  BR Act, 
1949, even the  RBI Act, 1934 , mandates the RBI to maintain expert staff to study various  aspects  of rural 
credit  and  development,  which emphasizes  the  premier  role  to  be  played  by RBI in  promoting financial 
literacy and financial inclusion among the citizens living  even  in the remote areas of the country. 
Right to Issue Bank Notes 
Management of currency is one of the core central banking functions of the Reserve Bank for which it derives 
the necessary statutory powers from Section 22 of the RBI Act, 1934. Along with the Government of India, the 
Reserve Bank is responsible for the design, production and overall management of the nation’s currency, with 
the goal of ensuring an adequate supply of clean and genuine notes. In consultation with the Government, the 
Reserve Bank routinely addresses security issues and targets ways to enhance security features to reduce the 
risk of counterfeiting or forgery of currency notes. 
EP-EBCL 
12 
The Paper Currency Act of 1861 conferred upon the Government of India the monopoly of issuing note, 
thus ending the practice of private and presidency banks issuing currency. Between 1861 and 1935, the 
Government of India managed the issue of paper currency. In 1935, when the Reserve Bank began 
operations, it took over the function of note issue from the Office of the Controller of Currency, 
Government of India. 
Denominations of Notes 
The Indian Currency is called the Indian Rupee (abbreviated as Re. in singular and Rs. in plural), and its 
sub-denomination the Paisa (plural Paise). At present, notes in India are issued in the denomination of `5, 
`10, `20, `50, `100, `200, `500 and `2,000. The printing of `1 and `2 denominations has been 
discontinued. However, notes in these denominations issued earlier are still valid and in circulation. The 
Reserve Bank is also authorised to issue notes in the denominations of five thousand rupees and ten 
thousand rupees or any other denomination, but not exceeding ten thousand rupees that the Central 
Government may specify. Thus, in terms of Section 24 of RBI Act 1934, notes in denominations higher than 
ten thousand rupees cannot be issued. The Central Government may, on the recommendation of the Central 
Board, direct the non-issue or the discontinuance of issue of bank notes of such denominational values as it 
may specify in this behalf. The Government of India announced the demonetisation of `500 and `1000 bank 
notes with effect from midnight of November 8, 2016, making these notes invalid.  A newly redesigned series 
of `500 banknote, in addition to a new denomination of`2000 banknote is in circulation since 10 November 
2016. 
Form of Bank Notes 
The Department of Currency Management makes recommendations on design of bank notes to the Central 
Government, forecasts the demand for notes, and ensures smooth distribution of notes and coins throughout 
the country [Section 25]. It arranges to withdraw unfit notes, administers the provisions of the RBI (Note 
Refund) Rules, 2009 (these rules deal with the payment of value of the soiled or mutilated notes) and 
reviews/rationalises the work systems and procedures at the issue offices on an ongoing basis. 
Legal tender character of notes 
Section 24 sub-section (1) of the Act states that subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), every bank note 
shall be legal tender at any place in India in payment or on account for the amount expressed therein, and 
shall be guaranteed by the Central Government. 
Sub-section 2 empowers the Central Government, on recommendation of the Central Board, by notification 
in the Gazette of India to declare that, with effect from such date as may be specified in the notification, any 
series of bank notes of any denomination to cease to be legal tender save at such office or agency of the 
Bank and to such extent as may be specified in the notification. 
Currency Distribution 
The Government of India on the advice of the Reserve Bank decides on the various denominations of the 
notes to be printed. The Reserve Bank coordinates with the Government in designing the banknotes, 
including their security features.  
The printed notes received from Printing Press set up by Government and RBI are issued for circulation both 
through remittances to banks as also the Reserve Bank counters. 
                                                                         Lesson 1          Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934                                   
13 
Coin Distribution 
The Indian Coinage Act, 1906 governs the minting of rupee coins, including small coins of the value of less 
than one rupee. Coins are legal tender in India for unlimited amounts. Fifty paisa coins are legal tender for 
any sum not exceeding ten rupees and smaller coins for any sum not exceeding one rupee. The Reserve 
Bank acts as an agent of the Central Government for distribution, issue and handling of the coins and for 
withdrawing and remitting them back to Government as may be necessary. 
Combating Counterfeiting 
The Reserve Bank, in consultation with the Government of India, periodically reviews and upgrades the 
security features of the bank notes to deter counterfeiting. It also shares information with various law 
enforcement agencies to address the issue of counterfeiting. It has also issued detailed guidelines to banks 
and government treasury offices on how to detect and impound counterfeit notes. 
Bank exempt from stamp duty on bank notes 
The Bank is not liable to the payment of any stamp duty under the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, in respect of 
bank notes issued by it {section 29]. 
Powers of Central Government to supersede Central Board 
Section 30 Sub section (1) of the states that if in the opinion of Central Government the Bank fails to carry 
out any of the obligations imposed on it by or under the Act, by notification in the Gazette of India, declare 
the Central Board to be superseded, and thereafter the general superintendence and direction of the affairs 
of the Bank shall be entrusted to such agency at the Central Government may determine, and such agency 
may exercise the powers and do all acts and things which may be exercised or done by the Central Board 
under the Act. 
As per sub section 2 of this section when action is taken under this section the Central Government shall 
cause a full report of the circumstances leading to such action and of the action taken to be laid before 
Parliament at the earliest possible opportunity and in any case within three months from the issue of the 
notification superseding the Board. 
Issue of demand bills and notes 
Section 31 Sub section (1) of the states that no person in India other than the Bank, or, as expressly 
authorized by the Act the Central Government shall draw, accept, make or issue any bill of exchange, hundi, 
promissory note or engagement for the payment of money payable to bearer on demand, or borrow, owe or 
take up any sum or sums of money on the bills, hundis or notes payable to bearer on demand of any such 
person: However cheques or drafts, including hundis, payable to bearer on demand or otherwise may be 
drawn on a person's account with a banker, shroff or agent. 
As per sub section 2 of this section notwithstanding anything contained in the Negotiable Instrument Act, 
1881, no person in India other than the Bank or, as expressly authorized by the Act, the Central Government 
shall make or issue any promissory note expressed to be payable to the bearer of the instrument. 
Banker to the Central Government & State Governments 
Reserve Bank acts as banker to all the State Governments in India, except Jammu & Kashmir and Sikkim. It 
has limited agreements for the management of the public debt of these two State Governments. As a banker 
EP-EBCL 
14 
to the Government, the Reserve Bank receives and pays money on behalf of the various Government 
departments.  
The Reserve Bank also undertakes to float loans and manage them on behalf of the Governments. It also 
provides Ways and Means Advances – a short-term interest bearing advance – to the Governments, to meet 
the temporary mismatches in their receipts and payments. Besides, it arranges for investments of surplus 
cash balances of the Governments as a portfolio manager. The Reserve Bank also acts as adviser to 
Government, whenever called upon to do so, on monetary and banking related matters.  
The banking functions for the governments are carried out by the Public Accounts Departments at the offices 
/branches of the Reserve Bank, while management of public debt including floatation of new loans is done at 
Public Debt Office at offices/branches of the Reserve Bank and by the Internal Debt Management 
Department at the Central Office.  
Management of Public Debt 
The Reserve Bank manages the public debt and issues new loans on behalf of the Central and State 
Governments. It involves issue and retirement of rupee loans, interest payment on the loan and operational 
matters about debt certificates and their registration.  
The union budget decides the annual borrowing needs of the Central Government. Parameters, such as, 
interest rate, timing and manner of raising of loans are influenced by the state of liquidity and the 
expectations of the market. The Reserve Bank’s debt management policy aims at minimising the cost of 
borrowing, reducing the roll-over risk, smoothening the maturity structure of debt, and improving depth and 
liquidity of Government securities markets by developing an active secondary market.  
Reserve Bank as Banker to Banks 
The Reserve Bank to fulfill this function, opens current accounts of banks with itself, enabling these banks to 
maintain cash reserves as well as to carry out inter-bank transactions through these accounts. Inter-bank 
accounts can also be settled by transfer of money through electronic fund transfer system, such as, the Real 
Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS).  
In addition, the Reserve Bank has also introduced the Centralised Funds Management System (CFMS) to 
facilitate centralised funds enquiry and transfer of funds across Deposit Accounts Department (DADs). This 
helps banks in their fund management as they can access information on their balances maintained across 
different DADs from a single location.  
As Banker to Banks, the Reserve Bank provides short-term loans and advances to select banks, when 
necessary, to facilitate lending to specific sectors and for specific purposes. These loans are provided 
against promissory notes and other collateral given by the banks. 
The Reserve Bank also acts as the ‘lender of last resort’. It can come to the rescue of a bank that is solvent 
but faces temporary liquidity problems by supplying it with much needed liquidity when no one else is willing 
to extend credit to that bank. The Reserve Bank extends this facility to protect the interest of the depositors 
of the bank and to prevent possible failure of a bank, which in turn may also affect other banks and 
institutions and can have an adverse impact on financial stability and thus on the economy. 
Financial Regulation and Supervision 
The Reserve Bank’s regulatory and supervisory domain extends not only to the Indian banking system but 
                                                                         Lesson 1          Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934                                   
15 
also to the development financial institutions (DFIs), non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), primary 
dealers, credit information companies and select segments of the financial markets.  
As the regulator and the supervisor of the banking system, the Reserve Bank has a critical role to play in 
ensuring the system’s safety and soundness on an ongoing basis. The objective of this function is to protect 
the interest of depositors through an effective prudential regulatory framework for orderly development and 
conduct of banking operations, and to maintain overall financial stability through various policy measures. 
Prudential Norms for Banks 
In order to strengthen the balance sheets of banks, the Reserve Bank has been prescribing appropriate 
prudential norms for them in regard to income recognition, asset classification and provisioning, capital 
adequacy, investments portfolio and capital market exposures, to name a few. A brief description of these 
norms is furnished below: 
Capital Adequacy: The Reserve Bank has instructed banks to maintain adequate capital on a continuous 
basis. The adequacy of capital is measured in terms of Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR). 
Under the recently revised framework, banks are required to maintain adequate capital for credit risk, market 
risk, operational risk and other risks. Basel II standardised approach is applicable with road map drawn up 
for advanced approaches. 
Loans and Advances: In order to maintain the quality of their loans and advances, the Reserve Bank 
requires banks to classify their loan assets as performing and non-performing assets (NPA), primarily based 
on the record of recovery from the borrowers. NPAs are further categorised into Sub-standard, Doubtful and 
Loss Assets depending upon age of the NPAs and value of available securities. Banks are also required to 
make appropriate provisions against each category of NPAs. Banks are also required to have exposure limits 
in place to prevent credit concentration risk and limit exposures to sensitive sectors, such as, capital markets 
and real estate. 
Investments: The Reserve Bank requires banks to classify their investment portfolios into three categories for 
the purpose of valuation: Held to Maturity (HTM), Available for Sale (AFS) and Held for Trading (HFT). The 
securities held under HFT and AFS categories have to be marked-to-market periodically and depreciation, if 
any, needs appropriate provisions by banks. Securities under HTM category must be carried at acquisition / 
amortised cost, subject to certain conditions. 
Foreign Exchange Reserves Management 
The Reserve Bank, as the custodian of the country’s foreign exchange reserves, is vested with the 
responsibility of managing their investment. The legal provisions governing management of foreign exchange 
reserves are laid down in the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. 
The Reserve Bank’s reserves management function has in recent years grown both in terms of importance 
and sophistication for two main reasons. First, the share of foreign currency assets in the balance sheet of 
the Reserve Bank has substantially increased. Second, with the increased volatility in exchange and interest 
rates in the global market, the task of preserving the value of reserves and obtaining a reasonable return on 
them has become challenging. The basic parameters of the Reserve Bank’s policies for foreign exchange 
reserves management are safety, liquidity and returns. 
Within this framework, the Reserve Bank focuses on: 
 
(a) Maintaining market’s confidence in monetary and exchange rate policies. 
EP-EBCL 
16 
 
(b) Enhancing the Reserve Bank’s intervention capacity to stabilise foreign exchange markets. 
 
(c) Limiting external vulnerability by maintaining foreign currency liquidity to absorb shocks during times 
of crisis, including national disasters or emergencies. 
 
(d) Providing confidence to the markets that external obligations can always be met, thus reducing the 
costs at which foreign exchange resources are available to market participants. 
 
(e) Adding to the comfort of market participants by demonstrating the backing of domestic currency by 
external assets. 
While safety and liquidity continue to be the twin-pillars of reserves management, return optimisation has 
become an embedded strategy within this framework. The Reserve Bank has framed policy guidelines 
stipulating stringent eligibility criteria for issuers, counterparties, and investments to be made with them to 
enhance the safety and liquidity of reserves. The Reserve Bank, in consultation with the Government, 
continuously reviews the reserves management strategies. 
Transactions in foreign exchange 
Section 40 of the Act says that the Bank shall sell to or buy from any authorized person who makes a 
demand in that behalf at its office in Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi or Madras or at such of its branches as the 
Central Government may, by order, determine, foreign exchange at such rates of exchange and on such 
conditions as the Central Government may from time to time by general or special order determine, having 
regard so far as rates of exchange are concerned to its obligations to the International Monetary Fund: 
In this section "authorized person" means a person who is entitled by or under the Foreign Exchange 
Regulation Act,to buy, or as the case may be, sell, the foreign exchange to which his demand relates. 
Market Operations 
The Reserve Bank operationalises its monetary policy through its operations in government securities, 
foreign exchange and money markets. 
Open Market Operations: Open Market Operations in the form of outright purchase/sale of Government 
securities are an important tool of the Reserve Bank’s monetary management. The Bank carries out such 
operations in the secondary market on the electronic Negotiated Dealing System – Order Matching (NDS-
OM) platform by placing bids and/or taking the offers for securities.  
Liquidity Adjustment Facility Auctions: The liquidity management operations are aimed at modulating liquidity 
conditions such that the overnight rates in the money market remains within the informal corridor set by the 
repo and reverse repo rates for the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) operations. In a repo transaction, the 
Reserve Bank infuses liquidity into the system by taking securities as collateral, while in a reverse repo 
transaction it absorbs liquidity from the system with the Reserve Bank providing securities to the counter 
parties.  
Market Stabilisation Scheme: The Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) was introduced in April 2004 under 
which Government of India dated securities/treasury bills could be issued to absorb surplus structural/ 
durable liquidity created by the Reserve Bank’s foreign exchange operations. MSS operations are a 
sterilisation tool used for offsetting the liquidity impact created by intervention in the foreign exchange 
markets.  
                                                                         Lesson 1          Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934

Payment and Settlement Systems 
The regulation and supervision of payment systems is being increasingly recognised as a core responsibility 
of central banks. Safe and efficient functioning of these systems is an important pre-requisite for proper 
functioning of financial system and the efficient transmission of monetary policy. 
The Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 provides for regulation and supervision of payment systems 
in India and designates the Reserve Bank as the authority for the purpose. As per the Act, only payment 
systems authorised by the Reserve Bank can be operated in the country. The Act also provides for the 
settlement effected under the rules and procedures of the system provider to be treated as final and 
irrevocable 
The Reserve Bank has put in place an institutional framework and structure for oversight of the payment 
systems. In 2005, it created a Board for Regulation and Supervision of Payment and Settlement Systems 
(BPSS) as a Committee of the Central Board. A new department called the Department of Payment and 
Settlement Systems (DPSS) was constituted to assist the BPSS in performing its functions. 
The Reserve Bank has adopted a three-pronged strategy of consolidation, development and integration to 
establish a modern and robust payment and settlement system which is also efficient and secure. The 
consolidation revolves around expanding the reach of the existing products by introducing clearing process 
in new locations.  
The Reserve Bank has also taken steps towards integrating the payment system with the settlement systems 
for government securities and foreign exchange. To facilitate settlement of Government securities 
transactions, it created the Negotiated Dealing System, a screen-based trading platform. 
For settlement of trade in foreign exchange, Government securities and other debt instrument, it has set up 
the Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL). This plays the role of a central counter party to transactions 
and guarantees settlement of trade, thus managing the counter party risk. 
Monetary Policy Management 
One of the most important functions of central banks is formulation and execution of monetary policy. In the 
Indian context, the basic functions of the Reserve Bank of India as enunciated in the Preamble to the RBI 
Act, 1934 are: “to regulate the issue of Bank notes and the keeping of reserves with a view to securing 
monetary stability in India and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its 
advantage.” Thus, the Reserve Bank’s mandate for monetary policy flows from its monetary stability 
objective. Essentially, monetary policy deals with the use of various policy instruments for influencing the 
cost and availability of money in the economy. As macroeconomic conditions change, a central bank may 
change the choice of instruments in its monetary policy. The overall goal is to promote economic growth and 
ensure price stability. 
Monetary Policy 
Monetary policy refers to the policy of the central bank with regard to the use of monetary instruments under 
its control to achieve the goals specified in the Act. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is vested with the 
responsibility of adopting and implementing monetary policy. This responsibility is explicitly mandated under 
the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. The primary objective of monetary policy is to maintain price stability 
while keeping in mind the objective of growth. Price stability is a necessary precondition to sustainable 
growth. 
EP-EBCL

Monetary Policy Framework 
The RBI Act explicitly provides empowers the Reserve Bank to operate the monetary policy framework of the 
country. 
• The framework aims at setting the policy (repo) rate based on an assessment of the current and 
evolving macroeconomic situation; and modulation of liquidity conditions to anchor money market 
rates at or around the repo rate. Repo rate changes transmit through the money market to the entire 
the financial system, which, in turn, influences aggregate demand – a key determinant of inflation and 
growth. 
• Once the repo rate is announced, the operating framework designed by the Reserve Bank envisages 
liquidity management on a day-to-day basis through appropriate actions, which aim at anchoring the 
operating target– the Weighted Average Call Rate (WACR) – around the repo rate. 
• The operating framework is fine-tuned and revised depending on the evolving financial market and 
monetary conditions, while ensuring consistency with the monetary policy stance.  
Instruments of Monetary Policy 
There are several direct and indirect instruments that are used for implementing monetary policy. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Repo Rate: The (fixed) interest rate at which the Reserve Bank provides overnight liquidity to banks 
against the collateral of government and other approved securities under the Liquidity Adjustment 
Facility (LAF). 
• Reverse Repo Rate: The (fixed) interest rate at which the Reserve Bank absorbs liquidity, on an 
overnight basis, from banks against the collateral of eligible government securities under the LAF. 
• Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF): The LAF consists of overnight as well as term repo auctions. 
Progressively, the Reserve Bank has increased the proportion of liquidity injected under fine-tuning 
variable rate repo auctions of range of tenors. The aim of term repo is to help develop the inter-bank 
term money market, which in turn can set market based benchmarks for pricing of loans and 
deposits, and hence improve transmission of monetary policy. The Reserve Bank also conducts 
variable interest rate reverse repo auctions, as necessitated under the market conditions. 
                                                                         Lesson 1          Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934                                   
19 
• Marginal Standing Facility (MSF): A facility under which scheduled commercial banks can borrow 
additional amount of overnight money from the Reserve Bank by dipping into their Statutory Liquidity 
Ratio (SLR) portfolio up to a limit at a penal rate of interest. This provides a safety valve against 
unanticipated liquidity shocks to the banking system. 
• Corridor: The MSF rate and reverse repo rate determine the corridor for the daily movement in the 
weighted average call money rate. 
• Bank Rate: It is the rate at which the Reserve Bank is ready to buy or rediscount bills of exchange or 
other commercial papers. The Bank Rate is published under Section 49 of the Reserve Bank of India 
Act, 1934. This rate has been aligned to the MSF rate and, therefore, changes automatically as and 
when the MSF rate changes alongside policy repo rate changes. 
• Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR): The average daily balance that a bank is required to maintain with the 
Reserve Bank as a share of such per cent of its Net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) that the 
Reserve Bank may notify from time to time in the Gazette of India. 
• Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR): The share of NDTL that a bank is required to maintain in safe and 
liquid assets, such as, unencumbered government securities, cash and gold. Changes in SLR often 
influence the availability of resources in the banking system for lending to the private sector. 
• Open Market Operations (OMOs): These include both, outright purchase and sale of government 
securities, for injection and absorption of durable liquidity, respectively. 
• Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS): This instrument for monetary management was introduced in 
2004. Surplus liquidity of a more enduring nature arising from large capital inflows is absorbed 
through sale of short-dated government securities and treasury bills. The cash so mobilised is held in 
a separate government account with the Reserve Bank. 
Constitution of Monetary Policy Committee 
Section 45ZB of the Act states that:- 
 
(1) The Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, constitute a Committee to be 
called the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank.  
 
(2) The Monetary Policy Committee shall consist of the following Members, namely:—

(c) one officer of the Bank to be nominated by the Central Board—Member, ex officio; and  
 
(d) three persons to be appointed by the Central Government—Members.  
 
(3) The Monetary Policy Committee shall determine the Policy Rate required to achieve the inflation 
target.  
 
(4) The decision of the Monetary Policy Committee shall be binding on the Bank. 
Meetings of Monetary Policy Committee  
Section 45ZI of the Act states that:- 
 
(1) The Bank shall organise at least four meetings of the Monetary Policy Committee in a year.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
As  per  Article  246  of  Constitution  of  India,  the 
Parliament  has  exclusive  power  to  make  laws  
with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the 
Union List in the Seventh Schedule. The Foreign 
Exchange Management  Act,  1999  can  be  traced  
to  various entries  in  the  Union  List.  Entry 16 of 
the Union List deals with Foreign jurisdiction. Entry 
36 of the Union List deals with Currency, coinage 
and legal tender; foreign exchange.   Entry  37  of

commerce  with  foreign countries; import and export 
across customs frontiers; definition of customs 
frontiers. 
The legal framework for administration of foreign 
exchange transactions in India is provided by the 
Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999. Under 
the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 
(FEMA), which came into force with effect from June 
1, 2000, all transactions involving foreign exchange 
have been classified either as capital account 
transactions or current account transactions. 
The object of the study is to familiarize the students 
with the overview of regulatory structure under 
Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999. 
 
 
 
  
“Foreign  Exchange  Management  Act,  1999  is  an  Act  to  facilitate  external  trade  and  payments  and  for  
promoting  the orderly development and maintenance of foreign exchange market in India.” 
Preamble  
LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 
A system of exchange control was first time introduced through a series of rules under the Defence of India 
Act, 1939 on temporary basis. As the foreign exchange crisis persisted for a long time Foreign Exchange 
Regulation Act, 1947 was enacted initially for a period of ten years.  However, 10 years of economic 
development did not ease the foreign exchange constraint, FERA permanently entered the statue book in 
1957. 
Subsequently, this Act was replaced by the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 (FERA, 1973), which 
came into force with effect from January 1, 1974. In 1974, FERA was completely overhauled with all offences 
being considered as criminal offences with mens rea. The Enforcement Directorate was empowered to arrest 
any person without even arrest warrant. 
In the 1990s, consistent with the general philosophy of economic reforms a sea change relating to the broad 
approach to reform in the external sector took place. In 1991 government of India initiated the policy of 
economic liberalization. Foreign investments in many sectors were permitted. This resulted in increased flow 
of foreign exchange in India and foreign exchange reserves increased substantially. 
In 1997, the Tarapore Committee on Capital Account Convertibility (CAC), constituted by the Reserve Bank, 
had indicated the preconditions for Capital Account Convertibility. The three crucial preconditions were fiscal 
consolidation, a mandated inflation target and, strengthening of the financial system. The Tarapore 
Committee had also recommended change in the legislative framework governing foreign exchange 
transactions. 
A Bill introduced in the Lok Sabha on 4 August, 1998 was referred to the Standing Committee on Finance 
which submitted it’s report to the House on 23 December ’98 with suggestion and modifications. As the 12th 
Lok Sabha was dissolved before any decision could be taken on the Bill, the Bill lapsed consequently. The 
Bill was again introduced in the 13th Lok Sabha on 25th October 1999 and was passed in the winter session 
of Parliament in 1999. The President Assent was received on 29th December, 1999.  
Finally FEMA came into force w.e.f. 1st June 2000.  Accordingly, the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act 
(FERA) was repealed and replaced by the new Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) with effect from 
June 2000. The philosophical approach was shifted from that of conservation of foreign exchange to one of 
facilitating trade and payments as well as developing orderly foreign exchange market. 
Overview of FEMA 
The Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 was enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to 
foreign exchange with the objective of facilitating external trade and payments and for promoting the orderly 
development and maintenance of foreign exchange market in India. In fact it is the central legislation that 
deals with inbound investments into India and outbound investments from India and trade and business 
between India and the other countries.

Applicability 
Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 extends to the whole of India. The Act also applies to all 
branches, offices and agencies outside India owned or controlled by a person resident in India and also to 
any contravention thereunder committed outside India by any person to whom this Act applies. 
FEMA has considerably liberalised provisions in respect of foreign exchange. However, in extraordinary 
situations may arise. The Central Government has been empowered to suspend operation of any or all 
provisions of FEMA in public interest, by issuing a notification. The Central Government has also been 
empowered to relax suspension by issuing a notification. 
Overall Scheme of FEMA 
FEMA makes provisions for dealings in foreign exchange. Broadly, all Current Account Transactions are 
free. However, Central Government can impose reasonable restrictions by issuing rules (Section 3 
FEMA).Capital Account Transactions are permitted to the extent specified by RBI by issuing Regulations. 
(Section 6 of FEMA) 
FEMA envisages that RBI shall have a controlling role in management of foreign exchange. Since RBI 
cannot directly handle foreign exchange transactions, it authorizes “Authorised Persons” to deal in foreign 
exchange.  RBI has been empowered to issue directions to such “Authorised Persons” under Section 11.  
FEMA also makes provisions for enforcement, penalties, adjudication and appeal. The FEMA 1999 contains

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
When a business enterprise imports goods from 
other countries,  exports  its  products  to  them  or  
makes investments  abroad,  it  deals  in  foreign  
exchange.  
Foreign  exchange  means  'foreign  currency'  and 
includes  deposits,  credits  and  balances  payable  
in any  foreign  currency;  drafts,  travellers'  
cheques, letters  of  credit  or  bills  of  exchange,  
expressed  or drawn  in  Indian  currency  but  
payable  in  any  foreigncurrency;  and  drafts,  
travellers'  cheques,  letters  of credit or bills of 
exchange drawn by banks, institutions or  persons  
outside  India,  but  payable  in  Indian currency. 
The  management  of  foreign  exchange  is  very 
important  in  the  present  day  business.  This 
lesson deals with how FEMA facilitates external 
trade and payments and promotes the orderly 
development and maintenance of foreign exchange 
market. The Act has assigned an important role to 
the 
Reserve 
Bank 
of 
India 
(RBI) 
in 
the 
administration of FEMA. The rules, regulations and 
norms pertaining to several sections of the Act are 
laid down by the Reserve Bank of India, in 
consultation with the Central Government. 
The object of the study is to familiarize the students 
with the Foreign Exchange Transactions and 
compliances thereto. 
 
  
The  Foreign  Exchange Management  Act, 1999 was enacted by the Parliament, taking  into  consideration  the  
developments  such  as  substantial  increase  in  foreign  exchanges  reserves, growth  in  foreign  trade,  
rationalization  of  tariffs,  current  account  convertibility  etc.,

INTRODUCTION 
The Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973, which was enacted to consolidate and amend the law in 
several respects encompassing the experience gained over few decades of implementation of the earlier 
enactment of 1947, had outlived its purpose in the light of the liberalization policies introduced in 1991. 
The Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, since then had been reviewed and amendments were made as part 
of ongoing process of economic liberalization relating to foreign investment and foreign trade for closer 
interaction with the world economy. During the subsequent period, the Central Government decided further 
review of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act in the light of developments and experience in relation to 
foreign trade and investment. It was at that time felt, that a better course would be to repeal the Foreign 
Exchange Regulation Act and enact a new legislation. 
Accordingly, taking into consideration the developments such as substantial increase in foreign exchanges 
reserves, growth in foreign trade, rationalization of tariffs, current account convertibility etc., the Foreign 
Exchange Management Bill, to repeal and replace the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act was introduced in 
the Lok Sabha. But before the Bill came up for discussion and approval, the Lok Sabha was dissolved. 
Subsequently, certain modifications were made to the original Bill and a modified Bill was presented and 
passed by both the Houses of Parliament. The Foreign Exchange Management Act received the assent of 
the President on 9th December, 1999 and brought into force with effect from 1st June, 2000. Foreign 
Exchange Management Act, 1999 is an Act to facilitate external trade and payments and for promoting the 
orderly development and maintenance of foreign exchange market in India. 
IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS 
Section 2 of the Foreign Exchange Management Act defines various terms used in the Act, and certain 
important definitions are given below: 
Adjudicating Authority [Section 2(a)] 
According to clause (a) of Section 2 ‘Adjudicating Authority’ means an officer authorised under Sub-section 
(1) of Section 16 for the purposes of adjudication in respect of penalties under Section 13. Section 16 
empowers the Central Government, to appoint, by an order published in the Official Gazette, as many

manager or secretary or other officer of the company, they will also be deemed to be guilty of contravention

COMPOUNDING OF CONTRAVENTIONS  
Contravention is a breach of the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999 and 
rules/regulations/notification/orders/directions/circulars issued there under. Compounding refers to the 
process of voluntarily admitting the contravention, pleading guilty and seeking redressal. The Reserve Bank 
is empowered to compound any contraventions as defined under section 13 of FEMA, 1999 except the 
contravention under section 3(a), for a specified sum after offering an opportunity of personal hearing to the 
contravener. It is a voluntary process in which an individual or a corporate seeks compounding of an 
admitted contravention. It provides comfort to any person who contravenes any provisions of FEMA, 1999 
[except section 3(a) of the Act] by minimizing transaction costs. Willful, malafide and fraudulent transactions 
are, however, viewed seriously, which will not be compounded by the Reserve Bank. 
Any person who contravenes any provision of the FEMA, 1999 [except section 3(a)] or contravenes any rule, 
regulation, notification, direction or order issued in exercise of the powers under this Act or contravenes any 
condition subject to which an authorization is issued by the Reserve Bank, can apply for compounding to the 
Reserve Bank. Applications seeking compounding of contraventions under section 3(a) of FEMA, 1999 may 
be submitted to the Directorate of Enforcement.

Pre-requisite for Compounding Process 
 In respect of a contravention committed by any person within a period of three years from the date on 
which a similar contravention committed by him was compounded under the Compounding Rules, such 
contraventions would not be compounded and relevant provisions of the FEMA, 1999 shall apply. Any 
second or subsequent contravention committed after the expiry of a period of three years from the date 
on which the contravention was previously compounded shall be deemed to be a first contravention. 
 Contraventions relating to any transaction where proper approvals or permission from the Government or 
any statutory authority concerned, as the case may be, have not been obtained such contraventions 
would not be compounded unless the required approvals are obtained from the concerned authorities. 
 Cases of contravention such as those having a money laundering angle, national security concerns 
and/or involving serious infringements of the regulatory framework or where the contravener fails to pay 
the sum for which contravention was compounded within the specified period in terms of the 
compounding order, shall be referred to the Directorate of Enforcement for further investigation and 
EP-EBCL 
54 
necessary action under FEMA, 1999 or to the authority instituted for implementation of the Prevention of 
Money Laundering Act 2002, or to any other agencies, for necessary action as deemed fit. 
 In this connection, it is clarified that whenever a contravention is identified by the Reserve Bank or 
brought to its notice by the entity involved in contravention by way of a reference other than through the 
prescribed application for compounding, the Bank will continue to decide 
• whether a contravention is technical and/or minor in nature and, as such, can be dealt with by way of 
an administrative/ cautionary advice; 
• whether it is material and, hence, is required to be compounded for which the necessary compounding 
procedure has to be followed or 
• whether the issues involved are sensitive / serious in nature and, therefore, need to be referred to the 
Directorate of Enforcement (DOE). However, once a compounding application is filed by the 
concerned entity suo moto, admitting the contravention, the same will not be considered as ‘technical’ 
or ‘minor’ in nature and the compounding process shall be initiated in terms of section 15 (1) of 
Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 read with Rule 9 of Foreign Exchange (Compounding 
Proceedings) Rules, 2000. 
Scope and Procedure for Compounding 
 On receipt of the application for compounding, the Reserve Bank shall examine the application based on 
the documents and submissions made in the application and assess whether contravention is 
quantifiable and, if so, the amount of contravention. 
 The Compounding Authority may call for any information, record or any other documents relevant to the 
compounding proceedings. In case the contravener fails to submit the additional information/documents 
called for within the specified period, the application for compounding will be liable for rejection. 
 The following factors, which are only indicative, may be taken into consideration for the purpose of 
passing compounding order and adjudging the quantum of sum on payment of which contravention shall 
be compounded: 
• the amount of gain of unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the contravention; 
• the amount of loss caused to any authority/ agency/ exchequer as a result of the contravention; 
• economic benefits accruing to the contravener from delayed compliance or compliance avoided; 
• the repetitive nature of the contravention, the track record and/or history of non-compliance of the 
contravener; 
• contravener’s conduct in undertaking the transaction and in disclosure of full facts in the application 
and submissions made during the personal hearing; and any other factor as considered relevant and

 The time limit for this purpose would be reckoned from the date of receipt of the completed application 
for compounding by the Reserve Bank. 
 If the applicant opts for appearing for the personal hearing, the Reserve Bank would encourage the 
applicant to appear directly for it rather than being represented / accompanied by legal experts / 
consultants, as compounding is only for admitted contraventions. Appearing for or opting out of personal 
hearing does not have any bearing whatsoever on the amount imposed in the compounding order. If the 
authorized representative of the applicant is unavailable for the personal hearing, the Compounding 
Authority may pass the order based on available information/ documents. 
 The Compounding Order shall specify the provisions of the FEMA, 1999 or any rule, regulation, 
notification, direction or order issued in exercise of the powers under FEMA, 1999 in respect of which

 One copy of the compounding order issued under sub rule (2) of Rule 8 of Foreign Exchange 
(Compounding Proceedings) Rules, 2000 shall be supplied to the applicant (the contravener) and also to 
the Adjudicating Authority, where the compounding of any contravention is made after making of a 
complaint under sub-section (3) of section 16 of the FEMA, as the case may be. 
 To ensure more transparency and greater disclosure, it has been decided to host the compounding 
orders passed on the Reserve Bank’s website (www.rbi.org.in).

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 is 
internal security legislation and regulated by Ministry 
of Home Affaires which prohibits certain classes of 
persons from receiving ‘foreign contribution’.  It  also  
restricts certain classes  of  persons  from  accepting  
foreign  hospitality while  visiting  any  country  or  
territory  outside  India, without the prior permission 
of the Central Government.  
The Act provides that persons having definite 
cultural, economic,  educational,  religious  and  
social programmes should get themselves registered 
with the Government  of  India  before  accepting  
any  ‘foreign contribution’.  “Foreign  contribution”  
means  the donation,  delivery  or  transfer  made  by  
any  foreign source  of  any  article,  not  being  an  
article  given  to  a person  as  a  gift  for  his  
personal  use,  if  the  market value, in India, of such 
article, on the date of such gift, is not more than such 
sum as may be specified from time  to  time,  by  the  
Central  Government  by  the  rules made  by  it  in  
this  behalf;  of  any  currency,  whether Indian  or  
foreign;  any  security  as  defined  under Securities 
Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and the Foreign 
Exchange Management Act, 1999.  
The  Act  mandates  that  every  bank  or  authorized 
person  in  foreign  exchange  shall  report  to  
specified authority, the prescribed amount of foreign 
remittance, source  and  manner  in  which  foreign  
remittance  was received  and  other  particulars  in  
such  form  and manner  as  may  be  prescribed.   
The  object  of  the study  is  to  familiarize  the  
students  with  the  legal requirements stipulated 
under the FCRA, 2010. 
  
The  object  of  the  Foreign  Contribution  (Regulation) Act,  2010  is  to  regulate  the  acceptance  and  utilisation  of  
foreign contribution or  foreign  hospitality  by  certain  individuals  or  associations  or  companies  and  to  prohibit  
acceptance  and utilisation of foreign contribution or foreign hospitality for any activities detrimental to the national 
interest and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL 
58 
INTRODUCTION 
The Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 1976 was enacted to regulate the acceptance and utilization of 
foreign contribution or hospitality with a view to ensuring that the  Parliamentary institutions, political 
associations, academic and other voluntary organizations as well as individuals working in important areas of 
national life may function in a manner consistent with the values of sovereign democratic republic. The Act 
was amended in 1984 to extend it provisions to cover second and subsequent recipients of foreign 
contribution and to the members of higher judiciary, besides introducing the system of grant of registration to 
the association receiving foreign contribution. 
Significant development have taken place since 1984 such as change in internal security scenario, an 
increased influence of voluntary organizations, spread of use of communication and information technology, 
quantum jump in the amount of foreign contribution being received, and large scale growth in the number of 
registered organizations. This has necessitated large scale changes in the Act of 1976 and therefore, it was 
thought appropriate to replace the FCRA, 1976 by a new legislation to regulate the acceptance and 
utilization of foreign contribution and foreign hospitality by a person or association. 
The Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 has come into effect from May 1, 2011. The Ministry of 
Home Affairs has issued the necessary Gazette Notification vide S.O. 999 (E) dated the 29th April, 2011 in 
this regard. The Ministry of Home Affairs has also issued a Gazette Notification vide G.S.R. 349 (E) dated 
the 29th April, 2011 notifying the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Rules, 2011 made under section 48 of 
FCRA, 2010. The FCR Rules, 2011 have come into force simultaneously with FCRA, 2010.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) provides a situation 
where in both the host and the home nations derive 
some benefit. The home countries want to take the 
advantage of the vast markets opened by industrial 
growth. Whereas the host countries get to acquire 
resources 
ranging 
from 
financial, 
capital, 
entrepreneurship, 
technological 
know-how 
and 
managerial skills which assist it in supplementing its 
domestic savings and foreign exchange. 
India’s Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is an 
endorsement of its status as a preferred investment 
destination amongst global investors. India’s steady 
economic liberalization and its embrace of the 
global economy have been key factors in attracting 
FDI. To promote Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), 
the Government has put in place an investor-
friendly policy, wherein  except for a small negative 
list, most sectors are open for 100% FDI under the 
Automatic route. 
The  object  of  the study  is  to  familiarize  the  
students  with  the  legal requirements stipulated 
under the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Policy. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
The Government has put in place a policy framework on Foreign Direct Investment, which is transparent, predictable 
and easily comprehensible.  This framework is embodied in the Circular on Consolidated FDI Policy.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Joint Ventures/Wholly Owned Subsidiaries abroad 
promote economic co-operation between India and 
the host countries.  They  result  in  transfer  of  
technology  and skills, sharing the results of 
Research & Development, access to global market, 
promotion of brand image,  generation  of  
employment  and  utilization of raw materials  
available  in  India  and  the  host  country,  
increased  exports  of  plant  and machinery and 
goods and services from India, foreign exchange 
earnings through dividend, royalty, technical know-
how fee, etc. Since globalization of trade is a two-
way process, integration  of Indian  economy  with   
rest  of  the  world  with  all  its  attendant  benefits  
is  achieved through  overseas  investment. 
The  object  of  the study  is  to  familiarize  the  
students  with  the  regulatory and procedural 
aspect of investment in Joint Ventures (JV) and 
Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (WOS), abroad. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Direct investment outside India means investment by way of contribution to the capital or subscription to the 
Memorandum of Association of a foreign entity, signifying a long term interest  (setting  up  a  Joint  Venture  (JV)  or  
a  Wholly  Owned  Subsidiary  (WOS)) overseas and thus does not include portfolio investment. 
LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL 
 
130 
INTRODUCTION 
Overseas investments (or financial commitment) in Joint Ventures (JV) and Wholly Owned Subsidiaries 
(WOS) have been recognised as important avenues for promoting global reach of Indian entrepreneurs. Joint 
Ventures are perceived as a medium of economic and business co-operation between India and other 
countries. 
"Financial Commitment" means the amount of direct investment by way of contribution to equity, loan and 
100 per cent of the amount of guarantees and 50 per cent of the performance guarantees issued by an 
Indian Party to or on behalf of its overseas Joint Venture Company or Wholly Owned Subsidiary. 
Direct investment outside India means investments, either under the Automatic Route or the Approval Route, 
by way of contribution to the capital or subscription to the Memorandum of a foreign entity or by way of 
purchase of existing shares of a foreign entity either by market purchase or private placement or through 
stock exchange, signifying a long-term interest in the foreign entity (JV or WOS). 
A foreign entity is termed as JV of the Indian Party when there are other foreign promoters holding the stake 
along with the Indian Party. In case of WOS entire capital is held by the one or more Indian Company. 
It may be noted that the Indian party/ Resident Individual is required to route all transactions in respect of a 
particular overseas JV/WOS only through one branch of an Authorized Dealer. This branch would be the 
‘designated Authorised Dealer’ in respect of that JV/WOS and all transactions and communications relating 
to the investment in that particular JV/WOS are to be reported only through this ‘designated’ branch of an 
Authorized Dealer.  
"Joint Venture (JV)"/ "Wholly Owned Subsidiary (WOS)" means a foreign entity formed, registered or 
incorporated in accordance with the laws and regulations of the host country in which the Indian party makes 
a direct investment. 
Approval Route 
The Government has adopted two way approach to the approval of direct investment, i.e. Automatic Route 
and Approval Route. 
Under the Automatic Route, an Indian Party does not require any prior approval from the Reserve Bank for 
making direct investments in a JV/WOS abroad. The Indian Party should approach an Authorized Dealer 
Category – I bank with an application in Form ODI and the prescribed enclosures / documents for effecting 
the remittances towards such investments. However, in case of investment in the financial services sector, 
prior approval is required from the regulatory authority concerned, both in India and abroad. 
Proposals not covered by the conditions under the automatic route require prior approval of the Reserve 
Bank for which a specific application in Form ODI with the documents prescribed therein is required to be 
made through Authorized Dealer Category – I banks. 
Proposal for making Overseas Direct Investment (ODI) under approval route 
The applicant should approach their designated Authorized Dealer (AD) with the proposal which is submitted 
to Reserve Bank after due scrutiny and with the specific recommendations of the designated AD bank along 
with supporting documents. 
The designated Authorised Dealer, before forwarding the proposal is reuired to submit the Form ODI in the 
on-line OID application under approval route and the transaction number generated by the application should 
be mentioned in the letter.  In case the proposal is approved, the AD bank should effect the remittance under 
advice to Reserve Bank so that the Unique Identification Number (UIN) is allotted. 
                                                                         Lesson 6         Overseas Direct Investments (ODI) 
 
131 
For approval by Reserve Bank, following documents need to be submitted along with Section D and Section 
E of From ODI - Part I by the designated Authorized Dealer: 
 
(a) A letter from the designated Authorised Dealer’ of the Indian party in a sealed cover mentioning the 
following details: 
 
• Transaction number generated by the OID application. 
 
• Brief details of the Indian entity. 
 
• Brief details of the overseas entity. 
 
• Background of the proposal, if any. 
 
• Brief details of the transaction. 
 
• Reason/s for seeking approval mentioning the extant FEMA provisions. 
 
• Observations of the designated AD bank with respect to the following: 
 
• Prima facie viability of the JV/ WOS outside India; 
 
• Contribution to external trade and other benefits which will accrue to India through such 
investment; 
 
• Financial position and business track record of the Indian Party (IP) and the foreign entity; 
 
• Expertise and experience of the IP in the same or related line of activity of the JV/ WOS outside 
India. 
 
• Recommendations of the designated AD bank. 
 
(b) A letter from the IP addressed to the designated AD bank. 
 
(c) Board resolution for the proposed transaction/s. 
 
(d) Diagrammatic representation of the organisational structure indicating all the subsidiaries of the IP 
horizontally and vertically with their stake (direct & indirect) and status (whether operating company 
or SPV). 
 
(e) Incorporation certificate and the valuation certificate for the overseas entity (if applicable). 
 
(f) Other relevant documents properly numbered, indexed and flagged. 
It may be noted that the Indian party/ Resident Individual is required to route all transactions in respect of a 
particular overseas JV/WOS only through one branch of an Authorized Dealer. This branch would be the 
‘designated Authorised Dealer’ in respect of that JV/WOS and all transactions and communications relating 
to the investment in that particular JV/WOS are to be reported only through this ‘designated’ branch of an 
Authorized Dealer.  
ODI transactions that require RBI approval 
Some of the proposals which require prior approval are: 
 
(i) Overseas Investments in the energy and natural resources sector exceeding the prescribed limit of 
net worth of Indian companies as on the date of the last audited balance sheet; 
 
(ii) Investments in Overseas Unincorporated entities in the oil sector by resident corporates exceeding 
the prescribed limit of their net worth as on the date of last audited balance sheet, provided the 
proposal has been approved by the competent authority and is duly supported by a certified copy of 
Board Resolution approving such investment. However, Navaratna Public Sector Undertakings, 
ONGC Videsh Ltd and Oil India Ltd are allowed to invest in overseas unincorporated / incorporated 
entities in oil sector (i.e. for exploration and drilling for oil and natural gas, etc.), which are duly 
approved by the Government of India, without any limits, under the automatic route; 
EP-EBCL 
 
132 
 
(iii) Overseas Investments by proprietorship concerns and unregistered partnership firms satisfying 
certain eligibility criteria; 
 
(iv) Investments by Registered Trusts / Societies (satisfying certain eligibility criteria) engaged in the 
manufacturing / educational / hospital sector in the same sector in a JV / WOS outside India; 
 
(v) Corporate guarantee by the Indian Party to second and subsequent level of Step Down Subsidiary 
(SDS); 
 
(vi) All other forms of guarantees which are offered by the Indian Party to its first and subsequent level 
of SDS; 
 (vii) Restructuring of the balance sheet of JV/WOS involving write-off of capital and receivables in the 
books of listed/ unlisted Indian Company satisfying certain eligibility; 
 (viii) Capitalization of export proceeds remaining unrealized beyond the prescribed period of realization 
to require prior approval of the Reserve Bank; and 
 
(ix) Proposals from the Indian party for undertaking financial commitment without equity contribution in 
JV / WOS may be considered by the Reserve Bank under the approval route based on the business 
requirement of Indian Party and legal requirement of host country in which JV/WOS is located.

Focus of the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 
The Foreign Trade Policy is primarily focused on accelerating exports. This is sought to be implemented 
through various schemes intended to exempt and remit indirect taxes on inputs physically incorporated in the 
export product, import capital goods at concessional duty, stimulate services exports and focus on specific 
markets and products. The Policy attempts to dovetail these schemes with the specific market access 
openings that India has achieved through negotiations with its trading partners for various bilateral and 
regional trading arrangements.

The Foreign Trade Policy  2015-20, is notified by Central Government, in exercise of powers conferred under 
Section 5 of the Foreign Trade (Development & Regulation) Act, 1992, as amended. The Foreign Trade 
Policy, 2015-20 came into force with effect from 01.04.2015

LESSON ROUND-UP 
• India’s Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) has, conventionally, been formulated for five years at a time and 
reviewed annually.  The  focus  of  the  FTP  has  been  to  provide  a  framework  of  rules  and  
procedures  for  exports  and imports and a set of incentives for promoting exports.  
• The Foreign  Trade  Policy  is  primarily  focused  on  accelerating  exports.  This  is  sought  to  be  
implemented through various schemes intended to exempt and remit indirect taxes on inputs physically 
incorporated  in the export  product,  import  capital  goods  at  concessional  duty,  stimulate  services  
exports  and  focus  on  specific markets and products.  
• The Foreign Trade Policy, 2015-20, is notified by Central Government, in exercise of powers conferred  
EP-EBCL 
 
198 
under Section 5 of the Foreign Trade (Development & Regulation) Act, 1992 (No. 22 of 1992) [FT (D&R) 
Act], as amended. The Foreign Trade Policy, 2015-20 came into force with effect from 01.04.2015.  
• Capital Goods means any plant, machinery, equipment or accessories required for manufacture or 
production, either  directly  or  indirectly,  of  goods  or  for  rendering  services,  including  those  required  
for  replacement, modernisation,  technological  up-gradation  or  expansion.  It  includes  packaging  
machinery  and  equipment, refrigeration equipment, power generating sets, machine tools, equipment and 
instruments for testing, research and development, quality and pollution control. 
• An  Importer-Exporter  Code  (IEC)  Number  is  a  10-digit  number  allotted  to  a  person  that  is  
mandatory  for undertaking  any  export/import  activities.  Now  the  facility  for  IEC  in  electronic  form  or  
e-IEC  has  also  been  operationalised.  
• The  objective  of  the  Export  from  India  Schemes  is  to  provide  rewards  to  exporters  to  offset  
infrastructural inefficiencies and associated costs involved and to provide exporters a level playing field.  
• Status Holders are business leaders who have excelled in international trade and have successfully 
contributed to country’s foreign trade. Status Holders are expected to not only contribute towards India’s 
exports but also provide guidance and handholding to new entrepreneurs. 
• The objective of the Export Promotion Capital Goods(EPCG) Scheme is to facilitate import of capital goods 
for producing quality goods and services to enhance India’s export competitiveness.  
• Units undertaking to export their entire production of goods and services (except permissible sales in DTA), 
may be set up under the Export Oriented Unit (EOU) Scheme, Electronics Hardware Technology Park 
(EHTP) Scheme, Software Technology Park (STP) Scheme or Bio-Technology Park (BTP) Scheme for 
manufacture of goods,  including  repair,  re-making,  reconditioning, re-engineering,  rendering  of

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
The NBFC (Non-Banking Finance Company) sector 
has grown in size and complexity over the years. The 
Reserve Bank of India is entrusted with the 
responsibility of regulating and supervising the Non-
Banking Financial Companies by virtue of powers 
vested in Chapter III B of the Reserve Bank of India 
Act, 1934. 
The  object  of  the study  is  to  familiarize  the  
students  with  the Non-Banking Financial Company 
(NBFC) engaged in the business of loans and 
advances, acquisition of shares/stocks/ bonds/ 
debentures/securities issued by Government or local 
authority or other marketable securities of a like

LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL

INTRODUCTION 
The Reserve Bank of India is entrusted with the responsibility of regulating and supervising the Non-Banking 
Financial Companies by virtue of powers vested in Chapter III B of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. The 
regulatory and supervisory objective, is to: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) is a company registered under the Companies Act, engaged in 
the business of loans and advances, acquisition of shares/stocks/bonds/debentures/securities issued by 
Government or local authority or other marketable securities of a like nature, leasing, hire-purchase, 
insurance business, chit business but does not include any institution whose principal business is that of 
agriculture activity, industrial activity, purchase or sale of any goods (other than securities) or providing any 
services and sale/purchase/construction of immovable property 
A non-banking institution which is a company and has principal business of receiving deposits under any 
scheme or arrangement in one lump sum or in installments by way of contributions or in any other manner, is 
also a non-banking financial company (Residuary non-banking company). 
NBFCs lend and make investments and hence their activities are akin to that of banks; however there are 
few differences such as: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Registration with RBI 
A company incorporated under the Companies Act and desirous of commencing business of non-banking 
financial companies 
NBFC cannot accept demand deposits 
Deposit insurance facility of Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation 
is not available to depositors of NBFC’s, unlike in the case of banks 
Ensure healthy growth of financial companies 
Ensure that these companies function as a part of the financial system within the 
policy framework, in such a manner that their existence and functioning do not lead 
to systemic aberrations 
The quality of surveillance and supervision exercised by the Bank over the NBFC’s is 
sustained by keeping pace with the developments that take place in this sector of the 
financial system. 
NBFC’s do not form part of the payment and settlement system and 
cannot issue cheques drawn on itself 
                                                                         Lesson 10         Non-Banking Financial Companies 201 
financial institution as defined under Section 45 I(a) of the RBI Act, 1934 should comply with the following: 
 
i. it should be a company registered under the Companies Act, and 
 
ii. It should have a minimum net owned fund. 
It may be noted that ‘Owned Fund’ means aggregate of the paid-up equity capital, preference shares which 
are compulsorily convertible into equity, free reserves, balance in share premium account and capital 
reserves representing surplus arising out of sale proceeds of asset, excluding reserves created by 
revaluation of asset, after deducting therefrom accumulated balance of loss, deferred revenue expenditure 
and other intangible assets.  
'Net Owned Fund' is the amount as arrived at above, minus the amount of investments of such company in 
shares of its subsidiaries, companies in the same group and all other NBFCs and the book value of 
debentures, bonds, outstanding loans and advances including hire purchase and lease finance made to and 
deposits with subsidiaries and companies in the same group, to the extent it exceeds 10% of the owned 
fund. 
In terms of Section 45-IA of the RBI Act, 1934, no Non-banking Financial company can commence or carry 
on business of a non-banking financial institution without obtaining a certificate of registration from the 
Reserve Bank. 
However, in terms of the powers given to the Bank, to obviate dual regulation, certain categories of NBFCs 
which are regulated by other regulators are exempted from the requirement of registration with RBI viz. 
Venture Capital Fund/Merchant Banking companies/Stock broking companies registered with SEBI, 
Insurance Company holding a valid Certificate of Registration issued by IRDA, Nidhi companies as notified 
under the Companies Act,  Chit companies as defined in clause (b) of Section 2 of the Chit Funds Act, 
1982,Housing Finance Companies regulated by National Housing Bank, Stock Exchange or a Mutual Benefit 
company.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Special  Economic  Zones  (SEZ)  are  growth  
engines that  can  boost  manufacturing,  augment  
exports  and generate employment. The SEZs 
require special fiscal and regulatory regime in order 
to 
impart 
a 
hassle 
free 
operational 
regime 
encompassing the state of the art infrastructure and 
support services.  
Special  Economic  Zone  (SEZ)  is  a  specifically 
delineated duty free enclave and shall be deemed to 
be  foreign  territory  for  the  purposes  of  trade 
operations and duties and tariffs. Goods and services 
going  into  the  SEZ  area  from  Domestic  Tariff  
Area treated  as  exports  and  goods  coming  from  
the  SEZ area into DTA treated as if these are being 
imported.  
SEZ units may  be  set  up  for  manufacture  of  
goods and rendering of services. The Government  
of  India  had  announced  a  Special Economic Zone 
scheme in April, 2000 with a view to provide an 
internationally competitive environment  for exports.  
To  instil  confidence  in  investors  and  signal the 
Government's commitment to a stable SEZ policy 
regime and with a view to impart stability to the SEZ 
regime  thereby  generating  greater  economic  
activity and employment through the establishment of 
SEZs, the  Special  Economic  Zones Act,  2005,  
was  passed by Parliament in 2005.  
The  object  of  the study  is  to  familiarize  the  
students, how Special Economic Zones Act  provides  
single  window  approval  mechanism, establishment  
of  Authority,  Off-Shore  Banking  Units and Special 
Court for Special Economic Zones. 
 
  
SEZ  Act,  2005  to  provide  for  the  establishment,  development  and  management  of  the  Special  Economic 
Zones for the promotion of exports and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.  
LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL 
220 
INTRODUCTION 
While the policy relating to the Special Economic Zones is contained in the Foreign Trade Policy, incentives 
and other facilities offered to the Special Economic Zone developer and units are implemented through 
various notifications and circulars issued by the concerned Ministries/Departments. The system, therefore, 
did not lend enough confidence for investors to commit substantial funds for development of infrastructure 
and for setting up of the units in the Zones for export of goods and services. In order to give a long term and 
stable policy framework with minimum regulatory regime and to provide expeditious and single window 
clearance mechanism, the Government enacted Special Economic Zones Act, 2005.  
The salient features of the Act are as under:— 
 
(i) matters relating to establishment of Special Economic Zone and for setting up of units therein, 
including requirements, obligations and entitlements; 
 
(ii) matters relating to requirements for setting up of off-shore banking units and units in International 
Financial Service Center in Special Economic Zone, including fiscal regime governing the operation 
of such units; 
 (iii) the fiscal regime for developers of Special Economic Zones and units set up therein; 
 (iv) single window clearance mechanism at the Zone level; 
 
(v) establishment of an Authority for each Special Economic Zone set up by the Central Government to 
impart greater administrative autonomy; and 
 (vi) designation of special courts and single enforcement agency to ensure speedy trial and 
investigation of notified offences committed in Special Economic Zones.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Competition refers to a situation in a market place in 
which firms/ entities or sellers independently strive 
for the patronage of buyers in order to achieve a 
particular business objective, such as profits, sales, 
market share etc. Competition is not an end unto 
itself, rather a means to achieve economic efficiency 
and welfare objectives. Free and fair competition is 
one of the pillars of an efficient market economy. 
Therefore, competition has become a driving force in 
the global economy.  
Indian economy is on a high growth path. In the 
recent years the Indian economy has been one of the 
strongest performers in the world. However, the full 
growth potential of the economy remains yet to be 
realised. Infusion of greater degree of competition 
can play a catalytic role in unlocking the fuller growth 
potential in many critical areas of the economy, 
which hitherto has been held back by restriction on 
competition in various forms. 
The object of the study is to familiarize the students 
regarding anti-competitive agreements, abuse of 
dominance, Combination, competition Advocacy, 
Competition Commission of India. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
The Competition Act, 2002 to provide, keeping in view of the economic development of the country, for the 
establishment of a Commission to prevent practices having adverse effect on competition, to promote and sustain 
competition in the markets, to protect the interest of consumers and to ensure freedom of trade carried on by other 
participant in the markets in India and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
 
LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL 
236 
INTRODUCTION 
There is a growing recognition that a flexible, dynamic and competitive private sector is essential to fostering 
sustained economic development. Promoting effective competition spurs firms to focus on efficiency and 
improves consumer welfare by offering greater choice of higher-quality products and services at lower prices. 
It also promotes greater accountability and transparency in government-business relations and decision 
making, helps reduce corruption, lobbying, and rent seeking. In addition, it provides opportunities for broadly 
based participation in the economy and for sharing in the benefits of economic growth.  
The idea of competition has had, for two centuries or more, a powerful influence on the way we think about 
our society, the way we organise things and the way we conduct our own economic and personal lives. The 
competition being an essential element in the efficient working of markets encourages enterprise and 
efficiency and widens choice. By encouraging efficiency in industry, competition in the domestic market 
whether between domestic companies alone or between those and overseas companies also contribute to 
international competitiveness. The full benefits of competition are, however, felt in markets that are open to 
trade and investment.  
Economic theory suggests that prices and quantities in a competitive market equilibrate to levels that 
generate efficient outcomes at a given point of time. Competition is therefore, beneficial as it provides to 
consumers wider choice and provides sellers with stronger incentives to minimize costs, so eliminating 
waste. Competition increases the likelihood that cost savings resulting from efficiency gains will be passed 
on to a firm's customers, who may be either final consumers or intermediary customers (in which case costs 
of those firms are also lowered). Ample empirical evidence supports these arguments. The importance of 
competition for achieving a higher rate of innovation and adoption of new technologies over time is critical for 
sustaining rapid growth. Yet it is not automatic and is not the same as laissez faire. 
In fact, there are reasons to believe that less mature markets tend to be more, rather than less, vulnerable to 
anti-competitive practices than the markets of developed countries. Reasons include: (a) high "natural" entry 
barriers due to inadequate business infrastructure, including distribution channels, and (sometimes) intrusive 
regulatory regimes; (b) asymmetries of information in both product and credit markets; and (c) a greater 
proportion of local (non-tradable) markets. Competition also serves to diffuse socio-economic power, 
broadening participation in economic, social, and political advances while ensuring opportunities for new 
entrepreneurs. Moreover, it can facilitate realization of the benefits for the domestic economy of integrating 
into international trade and investment patterns. 
Several studies have demonstrated the stimulating effects of competitive markets in terms of growth and 
prosperity. William Lewis in his book, The Power of Productivity underlines this point forcefully with his 
observations on the growth of productivity in the late 1990s in the United States. The author has argued that 
more than technology and other factors, what matters above all is competition. Similarly, economist Paul 
London in his book, The Competition Solution concludes that heightened competition in the US over-
shadowed tax cuts or new technologies in explaining the prosperity of the 1990s. Competitive pressures 
helped suppress inflation and raise living standards through improved productivity. The author noted that 
competition from imports forced the steel and auto industry, among other manufacturers, to streamline, 
thereby pushing manufacturing productivity up by 4% a year. Competition has brought down real air fares, 
telephone rates and several other costs. Where jobs have been lost in one industry, these have been more 
than compensated by jobs created elsewhere; thus employment has not suffered but has shifted from losers 
to winners. This argument underlines across the board, the benefits of competition to a wide sections of 
society, including consumers, workers and many others.

Definition of Competition 
Competition is a complex and technical subject which does not lend itself to easy summary or concise 
clarification. Of late, with globalisation and opening of the markets worldwide, it has become a subject of 
great practical importance. It involves the establishment and development of concepts, legal principles and 
policies for the benefit of consumer interest. The principles and policies are applied to a wide range of private 
agreements and arrangements, which commercial undertakings enter into for themselves or with each other. 
In addition, they also apply to the policies and directions of the Government.  
In the absence of a generally accepted definition of the phenomenon of competition, it has to be regarded as 
the object fostered and protected by competition policy and law. The World Bank and OECD in its Report A 
Framework for the Design and Implementation of Competition Law and Policy, broadly defines the 
competition is “a situation in a market in which firms or sellers independently strive for the buyers’ patronage 
in order to achieve a particular business objective, for example, profits, sales or market share.” 
Competition can also be defined as a process of economic rivalry between market players to attract 
customers. These market players can be multinational or domestic companies, wholesalers, retailers, or 
even the neighborhood shopkeeper. In their pursuit to outdo rival enterprises, market players either adopt fair 
means (producing quality goods, being cost efficient, adopting appropriate technologies, etc.) or indulge in 
unfair measures (carrying out restrictive business practices – such as predatory pricing, exclusive dealing, 
tied selling, collusion, cartelisation, abuse of dominant position, etc.). However, in the interest of consumers, 
and the economy as a whole, it is necessary to promote an environment that facilitates fair competitive 
outcomes in the market, curb anti-competitive behaviour and discourage market players from adopting unfair 
measures. 
 
What is competition in the market? 
In common parlance, competition in the market means sellers striving independently 
for buyers’ patronage to maximize profit (or other business objectives).A buyer 
prefers to buy a product at a price that maximizes his benefits whereas the seller 
prefers to sell the product at a price that maximizes his profit. 
Competition and Economic Efficiency 
A number of empirical studies found a positive relationship between competition and innovation, productivity 
and economic growth. P. Aghion and P. Howitt in Endogenous Growth Theory offered several theoretical 
situations where competition is conducive to innovation – Intensified product market competition could force 
managers to speed up the adoption of new technologies; Intensive product market competition with 
incumbent firms engaged in step by step innovative activities could enhance each firms incentive to acquire 
or increase its technological lead over its rivals and, if labour markets are flexible, competition will induce 
skilled workers to move to opportunities employing best practices and technologies. Competition also 
reduces slack by providing more incentives for managers and workers to increase efforts and improve 
efficiency. Therefore, the product market competition disciplines firms into efficient operation.  
Nickel et. al. in his article Competition and Corporate Performance suggested three different channels of 
incentives – competition creates greater opportunities for comparing performance; a more competitive 
environment where price elasticity of demand tends to be higher, induces greater efforts among workers and 
managers for cost reducing improvements in productivity since improvements could generate larger increase 
in revenue and profits; and a more competitive environment forces managers to improve efficiency, because 
more intense the competition, greater the chances for inefficient to be extinguished.

UK White Paper on World Class Competition Regime clearly brings out the importance of competition in an 
increasingly innovative and globalised economy. Vigorous competition between firms is the lifeblood of 
strong and effective markets. Competition helps consumers get a good deal. It encourages firms to innovate 
by reducing slack, putting downward pressure on costs and providing incentives for the efficient organisation 
of production. 
Empirical evidences show that strong competition is closely linked to dynamic and efficient markets. The 
benefits of competitive forces for economic growth and consumer welfare are widely recognized and 
evidenced by several studies. Recently, an empirical study in the U.K. by the Centre for Competition Policy, 
University of East Anglia showed that prices were more than halved through competition in international 
telephony and airfares, and were significantly reduced in other areas. The survey also brought home the 
point that competition is not just about prices but is typically multi-faceted, bringing new ways of doing 
business and leading to technological and other advances. 
Michel Porter in his recent work Can Japan Compete? shows that in Japan only those sectors characterized 
by strong domestic competition remain internationally competitive following the country's recent economic 
downturn, examples include cameras, automobiles and audio equipment. Many leading competition experts 
believe in the premise that, in the presence of competition, the market will achieve the objective of 
maximising welfare.  
Competition Law and Policy 
The World Bank and OECD in its Report A Framework for the Design and Implementation of Competition 
Law and Policypointed out that a dynamic and competitive environment, underpinned by sound competition 
law and policy, is an essential characteristic of a successful market economy. Effective enforcement of 
competition law and active competition advocacy can also be powerful catalysts for successful economic 
restructuring. This in turn fosters flexibility and mobility of resources, which in the current global business 
environment are critical elements for the competitiveness of firms and industries across nations. Although the 
field of competition law and policy is evolving rapidly and includes many different viewpoints on specific 
issues, recognition is growing that effective competition law is important in shaping business culture and that 
its proper implementation needs to allow for the education of business people, government officials, the 
judiciary, and the interested public.  
 
The basic purpose of Competition Policy and law is to preserve and promote 
competition as a means of ensuring efficient allocation of resources in an economy. 
Competition policy typically has two elements: one is a set of policies that enhance 
competition in local and national markets. The second element is legislation 
designed to prevent anti-competitive business practices with minimal Government intervention, i.e., 
a competition law. Competition law by itself cannot produce or ensure competition in the market 
unless this is facilitated by appropriate Government policies. On the other hand, Government 
policies without a law to enforce such policies and prevent competition malpractices would also be 
incomplete. 
Competition policies cover a much broader set of instruments than competition law and typically include all 
policies aimed at increasing the intensity of competition or rivalry in local and national markets by lowering 
entry barriers and opportunities for harmful coordination, to ensure that markets work effectively and serve 
the interests of all citizens. Competition law is only a subset of a nation's competition policies. Competition 
policies typically include pro-competition approaches to trade, investment, sectoral regulation, and consumer 
protection. The barriers to international or interregional trade, restrictions on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
239 
and technology transfers, restrictions on entry in regulated network utility industries, regulations affecting the 
registration of new enterprises and the taxation and corporate governance of existing enterprises and rules 
on marketing practices all influence the extent of competitive pressures in markets and so are appropriate 
concerns of competition policies. In many countries, competition authorities have become the focal point for 
consultations and putting forward pro-competition viewpoints across a broad range of policy areas. 
Asian Development Bank in “During economic transition or reforms”, observed that “the benefits of an open 
market economy cannot be fully realized unless restrictions on competition are removed. Opening markets is 
not enough by itself for countries to begin reaping the benefits of competition; firms will still find incentives to 
engage in anti-competitive practices. Thus, the intended benefits of trade reforms may not be realized 
without active enforcement of competition law. This highlights the importance of having faith in the benefits of 
competition from an early stage of economic growth and of incorporating competition policy into the broader 
economic policy framework.” 
Prof. Paul Geroski, former Chairman, Competition Commission of the United Kingdom observed that 
“Competition policy is about ensuring that markets are, and remain, competitive. This brings benefits to 
consumers eventually in all the ways. However, eliminating anti-competitive practices and dismantling 
monopoly positions that lead to abuses also benefit firms whose business suffers from these practices and 
abuses. It is worth emphasizing that many of the benefits that emanate from proper application of 
competition policy are felt in the first instance by firms. This is important for those who seem to think of 
competition policy as an added and unnecessary burden on business. Competition policy is sometimes a 
burden on business, but only on those businesses that try to unfairly disadvantage their rivals in ways that 
reduce their competitive abilities or incentives to compete vigorously”. 
Hence, competition policy and competition law need to be distinguished. The former can be regarded as a 
genus, of which, the latter is specie.  
COMPETITION REGIME IN INDIA 
 
Historical Perspective 
The Indian economy remained subject to controls and regulations for several decades, such as industrial 
licensing, foreign exchange restrictions, small scale industry protection, control on foreign investment and 
technologies, quantitative restrictions on imports, administered prices, and control on capital issues. The 
domestic industry was thus insulated from competition. 
The economic consequences of this policy regime, though initially beneficial, were reflected in a poor rate of 
economic growth, low levels of productivity and efficiency, absence of international competitiveness, sub-
optimal size of businesses, and outdated and inefficient technologies in various sectors.  
India has therefore witnessed two phases of development process with different policy regimes and 
institutional frameworks. In the first phase, since independence, the transformation and development of the 
Indian economy took place within a planned, rigidly regulated and relatively closed economic framework. In 
the second phase, since 1991, when the country embarked upon reform process and embraced market 
oriented policies.  
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, need for liberalization policies was recognized and a range of policy and 
regulatory reforms were initiated, such as delicensing of industry, shrinking the monopoly of the public sector 
industries (other than those where strategic and security concerns dominated), removal of quantitative 
restrictions on imports, market determined exchange rate, liberalization of foreign direct investment, capital 
market reforms, liberalizing the financial markets, reduction in small scale industry reservations, and a much 
EP-EBCL 
240 
greater role for the private sector in infrastructure industries such as power, port, transport and 
communications.  
Economic Reforms and Competition 
The world economy has been experiencing a progressive international economic integration for the last half 
a century. There has been a marked acceleration in this process of globalisation and also liberalisation 
during the last three decades.  
Since 1991, the Government of India has introduced a series of economic reforms, including policies of 
liberalisation, deregulation, disinvestment and privatisation. The seriousness of macroeconomic imbalances 
and unanimity towards reform rendered this possible. The broad thrust of the new policies was a move away 
from the centralised allocation of resources in some key sectors by the government to allocation by market 
forces. Private participation in economic development has emerged as an alternative to the state-oriented 
development strategy in the reform period.  
After a decade of reforms, restraints to competition such as state monopolies and protective measures and 
controls have been replaced by relatively more competitive and de-regulated open market policies. In the 
post reform period, the private sector participation in production and supply of utility services has increased 
substantially. Independent regulators have been established for many sectors such as road, power, 
telecommunications and insurance. These sectoral regulators have been empowered to determine sector 
specific entry conditions and eventually the level of competition. In nutshell, post reforms period witnessed 
an open market orientation in industrial policy, foreign trade policy, foreign investment policy and financial 
sector policy, infrastructure policy, etc.  
Competition Law-Evolution and Development 
The first Indian competition law was enacted in 1969 and was christened as the Monopolies and Restrictive 
Trade Practices Act, 1969 (MRTP Act). The genesis of the MRTP Act, 1969 is traceable to Articles 38 and 39 
of the Constitution of India. The Directive Principle of State Policy in those Articles lays down, inter-alia that 
the State shall strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing and protecting as effectively, as it may, 
a social order in which justice - social, economic and political- shall inform all the institutions of the national 
life, and the State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing: 
 
1. that the ownership and control of material resources of the community are so distributed as best to 
subserve the common good; and  
 
2. that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and means 
of production to the common detriment. 
Legal framework dealing with competition in India spread over other legislations, besides the Monopolies and 
Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969, other legislations dealing with competition include Consumer 
Protection Act, 1986, the Patents Act 1970 etc.  
Background to the MRTP Act, 1969 
India, when it became free from the colonial power was industrially very backward. In fact, it inherited an 
economy in a ravaged condition. Under development of the economy in many respects led the successor 
Government to adopt a system of planning. In the interest of transformation of the backward industrial 
economy into an advanced industrial economy, the planners thought it fit to allow the then established 
industries to develop and grow further. Alongside, mixed economy was also developed as a concept of 
economic planning. No doubt, there was perceptible growth in industrialisation. However, this also brought 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
241 
on its trails, concentration of wealth and economic power. This led to widening of the difference between the 
haves and have nots in the society. The Government of India therefore set up the Monopolies Inquiry 
Commission in 1964 with a view to finding out the causes, the nature and the extent of concentration of 
economic power in the country and to suggest remedial measures therefor. 
The Monopolies Inquiry Commission submitted a detailed report in October 1965 which was well 
documented and revelatory of many facets of concentration of economic power. Many of the trade practices 
which were designed to stifle competition in the market and to promote monopolistic tendency were also 
noticed by the Commission in the course of its inquiry. The Commission observed that there was no need to 
strike at the concentration of economic power as such but to do so only when it became a menace to the 
best production in quality and quantity or to fair distribution. Monopolistic conditions in any industrial sphere 
should be discouraged without injury to the interests of the general public and monopolistic and restrictive 
trade practices should be curbed except when they were conducive to the common good. The Commission 
pointed out that on the one hand over the years certain business houses had built vast industrial empires 
and on the other hand they were trying to accentuate and enlarge the empires by adopting certain trade 
practices which were intended to distort competition in the market and promote a set of near monopoly 
conditions. The Commission felt that such tendencies seemed to destroy the basic concept of socio-
economic justice enshrined in the Constitution. The Commission also framed a draft Bill as a part of its 
recommendations.  
The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Bill was introduced in Parliament in 1967 which after being 
referred to the Joint Select Committee became an Act and finally came into force w.e.f. 1st June, 1970. 
The enactment was based on the socio-economic philosophy enshrined in the Directive Principles of State 
Policy contained in the Constitution which provides that the State shall direct its policy towards securing that 
the ownership and control of material resources of the community are distributed as best to subserve the 
common good and that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth 
and means of production to the common detriment. 
The principal objectives of the Act, as spelt out in the preamble were: 
 
(i) prevention of concentration of economic power to the common detriment; 
 
(ii) control of monopolies; 
 
(iii) prohibition of monopolistic trade practice; 
 
(iv) prohibition of restrictive trade practices. 
The MRTP Act, 1969 underwent amendments in 1974, 1980, 1982, 1984, 1986, 1988 and 1991. Major 
changes introduced in the 1982 and 1984 Amendment Acts were based on the recommendations of the 
Sachar Committee. The 1984 amendment introduced the concept of unfair trade practice under the Act. Far-
reaching changes have been brought about by the 1991 amendment and these were made in the wake of 
new industrial policy of July, 1991 which is wedded to liberalisation, globalisation and de-regulation. 
Scheme of the MRTP Act 
Prevention of undesirable concentration of economic power was sought to be achieved essentially through 
the regulation of growth of undertakings of particular size, viz. undertakings having assets of the value of 
`100 crores. These business houses were officially designated as large business houses. Undertakings 
having a sizable share of the market, or licensed production capacity of more than 1/4th of the total 
production or installed capacity in India were described as dominant undertakings. These companies were 
declared large business houses if their assets were of the value of `1 crore or more. 
EP-EBCL 
242 
These undertakings were referred to as MRTP undertakings. Such undertakings had to obtain approval of 
the Central Government to undertake substantial expansion of production, establishment of new 
undertakings, amalgamate with or takeover any other undertaking. Appointment of persons who were 
directors in such undertakings as director in any other undertaking needed the approval of the Central 
Government. The Central Government also had the power to order for division of such undertakings or for 
severance of interconnection under certain circumstances. Restrictions were placed on the acquisition and 
transfer of shares of, or by, bodies corporate owning such undertakings. 
However, the MRTP (Amendment) Act, 1991 sought to liberalise these restrictions by removing the concept 
of MRTP undertakings and provisions relating to their substantial expansion, amalgamation etc., and 
acquisition of shares of, or by, such undertakings etc. The provisions relating to Central Governments power 
to direct division of undertakings or severance of interconnection have been modified such that they apply to 
all undertakings (hitherto, they applied only to MRTP undertakings). 
Chapter IV deals with monopolistic trade practices indulged in by any undertaking. The Act defines the 
concept of monopolistic trade practices in terms of unreasonableness of the prices charged, 
unreasonableness in preventing or lessening competition in the market, unreasonably increasing prices, 
profits and limiting technical development to the common detriment etc. The remedy for dealing with 
monopolistic trade practice is an inquiry at the instance of the Central Government by the M.R.T.P. 
Commission or suo motu by the Commission and suitable orders being passed by the Central Government 
thereafter to prevent the mischief resulting from such practices. 
The Act also deals with matters relating to restrictive trade practices. Briefly stated, a restrictive trade 
practice is one which prevents, distorts or restricts competition for goods and services in any manner. While 
unreasonableness is the test for monopolistic trade practices, even a small distortion in competition is 
sufficient to bring a case under restrictive trade practices. The provisions relating to restrictive trade practices 
are therefore intended to promote fair and free competition in the market. The Act provides for a scheme of 
registration of certain agreements relating to restrictive trade practices. The MRTP (Amendment) Act, 1984 
introduced new provisions relating to unfair trade practices with a view to promoting the interest of 
consumers. It is essential to note that the M.R.T.P. Commission has been given full powers to regulate 
restrictive and unfair trade practices by means of an inquiry and pass final orders thereon. The MRTP 
Commission may inquire into restrictive and unfair trade practices at the instance of the Central Government, 
State Government, Director General of Investigation and Registration, registered consumer associations, 
individual consumer and on its own. The Commission has also powers to grant temporary injunctions and 
award compensation and punish for contempt under Sections 12A, 12B and 13B of the Act respectively. 
The Commission is an independent quasi-judicial body and has powers similar to a Civil Court under the 
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 on some matters. The Director General of Investigation and Registration and 
the Secretary of the Commission assist in the inquiry in respect of monopolistic, restrictive and unfair trade 
practices. The Commission conducts enquiries and other businesses in accordance with MRTPC 
Regulations, 1991. 
The Central Government has framed the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Rules, 1970, the 
Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (Classification of Goods) Rules, 1971, and the M.R.T.P. 
(Information) Rules, 1971 in exercise of the powers conferred under the Act. However these Rules have lost 
much of their significance in view of deletion of Sections 21 to 26 of the Act w.e.f. 27.9.91. 
MRTP (Amendment) Act, 1991 
The new industrial policy announced by the Government in Parliament on July 24, 1991 sought to amend the 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
243 
MRTP Act, 1969 by removing all pre-entry restrictions and placing more emphasis on controlling and 
regulating monopolistic, restrictive and unfair trade practices. 
The ‘Statement of Objects and Reasons to the MRTP (Amendment) Act, 1991 reiterates that the basic 
philosophy behind the MRTP Act, 1969 was not to inhibit industrial growth but to ensure that industrial 
growth was channelised for public good and growth did not perpetuate concentration of economic power to 
the common detriment. To quote, 
 
1. With the growing complexity of industrial structure and the need for achieving economies of scale 
for ensuring higher productivity and competitive advantage in the international market, the thrust of 
the industrial policy has shifted to controlling and regulating the monopolistic, restrictive and unfair 
trade practices rather than making it necessary for certain undertakings to obtain prior approval of 
the Central Government for expansion, establishment of new undertakings, merger, amalgamation, 
take over and appointment of directors. It has been the experience of the Government that pre-entry 
restrictions under the MRTP Act on the investment decision of the corporate sector has outlived its 
utility and has become a hindrance to the speedy implementation of industrial projects. By 
eliminating the requirement of time-consuming procedures and prior approval of the Government, it 
would be possible for all productive sections of the society to participate in efforts for maximisation 
of production. It is, therefore, proposed to re-structure the MRTP Act by omitting the provisions of 
Sections 20 to 26 and transfer the provisions contained in Chapter III-A regarding restrictions on 
acquisition and transfer of shares to the Companies Act, 1956. The Schedule to the MRTP Act is 
also consequently to be transferred with modification to the Companies Act, 1956. 
 
2. It is also proposed to enlarge the scope of inquiry by the MRTP Commission with a view to taking 
effective steps to curb and regulate monopolistic, restrictive and unfair trade practices which are 
prejudicial to public interest. It is also proposed to provide for deterrent punishment for 
contravention of the orders passed by the MRTP Commission and the Central Government and 
empower the Commission to punish for its contempt. Certain other consequential changes are also 
found necessary in the MRTP Act. 
Scope and Applicability of the MRTP Act 
Section 3 of the MRTP Act, 1969 provides that unless the Central Government, by notification in the Official 
Gazette otherwise directs, the Act shall not apply to: 
 
(a) undertakings owned or controlled by the Government, a government company, a corporation, a 
registered cooperative society and undertakings, the management of which has been taken over by 
the Central Government; 
 
(b) trade unions and other associations of workmen; 
 
(c) financial institutions. 
However, vide notification dated 27.9.1991, the Government has directed that the provisions of the MRTP 
Act shall apply to all undertakings and financial institutions specified in Section 3 which were hitherto outside 
the purview of the Act, except undertakings owned or controlled by a Government company, or the 
Government and engaged in the production of arms and ammunition and allied items of defence equipment, 
defence aircraft and warships, atomic energy, minerals specified in the schedule to the Atomic Energy 
(Control of Production and Use) Order, 1953 and industrial units under the Currency and Coinage Division, 
Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs. Thus, the hitherto anomaly which used to exist prior to 
27.9.91 about applicability of provisions of Act between private sector enterprises and public sector 
undertakings and those stated in sub-clause (a) to (g) of Section 3, has been removed. 
EP-EBCL 
244 
But trade unions and other associations of workmen or employees formed for their own reasonable 
protection as such workmen or employees continue to be exempt from the applicability of the MRTP Act. 
However, Truck owners or operators Unions/Associations being not of workmen have been held to be 
subject to the jurisdiction of MRTP Commission by Supreme Court in the case of Bharatpur Truck Operators 
Union. 
In effect, all public sector companies, except those engaged in the production of arms and ammunition etc. 
and industries under the Currency and Coinage Division, have been brought within the scope of the MRTP 
Act in respect of monopolistic, restrictive and unfair trade practices. 
MONOPOLISTIC TRADE PRACTICES 
Prohibition of monopolistic trade practices is one of the objects of the MRTP Act, 1969. The word ‘monopoly’ 
has not been defined in the MRTP Act. But it is common knowledge that a pure monopoly as well as 
‘monopolistic’ position leads to distortion of competition in the market, besides endangering in the normal 
circumstances concerted action to fix prices, supplies of commodities, etc. The result of such action is no 
doubt detrimental to the consuming public. 
The Monopolies Inquiry Commission made copious analysis of this aspect in its report. It is worth quoting the 
following passages from Chapter V of the report: 
Our study of product-wise concentration brings out prominently the fact that in a large number of industries, a 
single undertaking is the only supplier or at least has to its credit a very large portion of the market as 
compared with its competitors. Such an undertaking has the power to dictate the price of the commodity or 
services it supplies and to regulate its volume of production in such a manner as to maximize its profits. This 
power is what is generally understood by the words “monopoly power" Though in the strict etymological 
sense of the word, and in strict economic theory, monopoly exists when there is only one single supplier, 
there is no reason why an enterprise enjoying the power to dictate the price and thus to control the market 
even though it is not the single supplier should not be considered a monopoly. What happens in such cases 
is that the price decided upon by the dominant producer (or distributor) is followed by others who are in a 
position to compete. This price leadership phenomenon is in essence a manifestation of the price leaders 
power to dictate the price in the market. We think it proper therefore to include within the word monopoly not 
only the single supplier in a market but also the one dominant supplier who has the power to dictate the price 
in the market." 
“The question that next arises is : When such a power is shared by a few enterprises being the dominant 
sellers, should they be considered to be holding a monopolistic position? We see no reason to exclude such 
dominant sellers from our understanding of monopoly. For, the essence of monopoly is the ability to dictate 
the price and control the market without being materially influenced by other competing concerns.” 
One important difference between the situation when a single seller dominates the market and a few 
independent sellers together enjoy a dominating position cannot be overlooked. In the former case, 
monopoly power is inevitably present, in the latter it may or not be present. The effect on the market of a few 
dominant sellers has been widely discussed by economists, specially in recent years; but their opinions are 
by no means the same. We do not propose to try to resolve this controversy. It is sufficient for our purpose to 
notice that it is generally agreed that when a few big sellers dominate the market there will ordinarily be a 
high probability of their coming to some kind of agreement or understanding whether formal or not, about the 
price and output, by which a monopolistic power is shared between themselves. Even in the absence of such 
agreement or understanding it frequently happens that each has a healthy fear of the other big producers or 
distributors and ultimately a policy of live and let live comes into operation. Some economists point out that 
 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
245 
when a few large sellers dominate the market, each of them is able to calculate fairly and accurately the 
probable effect on the market of his action in increasing or decreasing his output. So, it is said that each will 
try to regulate the output in such a way that the marginal costs remain well below the price. Each such seller 
will also be well aware that any attempt of his to reduce the price is likely to be met immediately by similar 
action by his competitors. The matter is succinctly put by Stocking in Monopoly and Free Enterprise at p. 90 
thus: 
“In markets where sellers are few, each in trying to determine his most profitable volume of output must, as 
would a monopolist, consider the probable effects of various possible rates of production not only on costs 
but also on prices. Indeed each seller will ordinarily decide on the price at which he will sell and adjust his 
output accordingly, just as a monopolist does. Each oligopolist however in determining his price must 
consider not merely his own cost-price relationships but also how his rivals will react to his prices. Anyone of 
a few sellers, if fully informed and perfectly rational, when selling a completely standardised product will 
realise that if he reduces his prices his rivals will meet the lower price promptly. 
For all these reasons, we are convinced that when the market is dominated by a few sellers, monopolistic 
conditions will sometimes prevail. At the same time, we are conscious that even in a market of a few sellers, 
there will sometimes be keen competition. This is likely to happen apart from the effect of the mutual 
jealousies which sometimes characterise the relations between big business houses when one or more of 
the few sellers feel confident that due to superior managerial ability and technical skill and financial 
resources they will be able to capture a larger share of the market at the expense of their rivals. Even so, 
there is no gainsaying the fact that in a market of a few dominating sellers, there is real risk of the 
emergence of monopolistic power and consequently of monopolistic practices. To ascertain the extent to 
which monopolistic practices prevail, we must examine not only the cases where a single enterprise is the 
sole or dominant producer of the goods or services but also the cases where a few enterprises between 
themselves share such dominating position.” 
RESTRICTIVE TRADE PRACTICES  
The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969, has as one of its objects the prohibition of 
restrictive trade practices. In order to ensure that the benefits of free and fair competition in a market reach 
the ultimate consumer, it is essential that the process of competition should not be distorted by any trade 
practice, either by a single manufacturer or a group of manufacturers or dealers. For instance, if a 
manufacturer stipulates a condition that the wholesale purchaser shall sell only his products and not of 
others or shall resell the goods only at the prices stipulated by him or forces the wholesale purchaser to 
procure the entire line of manufacture from him, the result may be a distortion of competition in the market. 
The MRTP Act is concerned with promoting fair and free competition in the market, the securing of consumer 
interest being the ultimate goal. 
The Monopolies Inquiry Commission in its report observed that a restrictive trade practice means a practice 
which obstructs the free play of competitive forces or impedes the free flow of capital or resources into the 
stream of production or of the finished goods in the stream of distribution at any point before they reach the 
hands of the ultimate consumer. The Commision list out the following types of restrictive trade practices 
pursued not only in India but also in many other countries. These include(i) horizontal fixation of price (ii) 
vertical fixation of price and re-sale price maintenance; (iii) allocation of markets between purchasers; (iv) 
discrimination between purchasers; (v) boycott; (vi) exclusive dealing contracts; and (vii) tie-up 
arrangements. 
The Monopolies Inquiry Commission made a wee-bit of distinction between a monopolistic trade practice and 
a restrictive trade practice. It observed every monopolistic trade practice is on the face of it a restrictive trade 
EP-EBCL 
246 
practice. Indeed, sometimes the two words are used indiscriminately. Thus the report of Macquarrie 
Committee which was set up to study Canadian Combines Legislation treats all combines or common policy 
among several firms designed to strengthen the market position of a group of firms as monopolistic 
practices. In our opinion, every practice whether it is by action or understanding or agreement, formal or 
informal, to which persons enjoying monopoly power resort in exercise of the same to reap the benefits of 
that power and every action, understanding or agreement tended to or calculated to preserve, increase or 
consolidate such power should properly be designated as monopolistic trade practice. 
UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES  
Unfair trade practices in trade and commerce were prevalent even in older days. Priests in Sumaria and 
Babylon are on record to have lent money to the needy at high rates of interest. During the period of Tudors, 
practices of forestalling (meaning pushing up prices by buying up supplies before they reached market), 
regrating (buying up supplies in the market), and engrossing (buying up supplies wherever available) were 
prevalent. Thus exploitation at market place is not a new phenomena of modern civilisation. At present 
various types of unfair trade practices are prevalent at National as well as at International markets. The 
legislative history of countries the world over bears redeeming testimony to the endeavours of the National 
Governments to enact suitable legislations to curb such unfair trade practices. 
The underlying objective of such legislative endeavours has been to make the behaviour at market place 
conducive to righteous dealings so that the ultimate consumer gets a fair deal. Senator Murphy, the then 
Australian Attorney General, introducing the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill of the Commonwealth of 
Australia in the Senate said: In consumer transactions, unfair practices are widespread. The existing law is 
still founded on the principle known as ‘Caveat Emptor meaning ‘let the buyer beware. That principle may 
have been appropriate for transactions conducted in village markets, it has ceased to be appropriate as a 
general rule. Now the marketing of goods and services is conducted on organised basis and by the trained 
business executives. The untrained consumer is no match for the businessman who attempts to persuade 
the consumer to buy goods or services on terms and conditions suitable to the vendor. The consumer needs 
protection by the law and this Bill will provide such protection. 
It is often said that consumers need no special protection; all can be safely left to the market. But the concept 
of perfect market is an economists dream and consumers sovereignty a myth. In real life products are 
complex and of great variety and consumers and retailers have imperfect knowledge. Suppliers may often 
have a dominant buying position. As a consequence bargaining power in the market is generally weighed 
against the consumer. Thus consumers have felt the need to create organisations to identify their interests 
and to supply information and advice. 
The Federal Trade Commission of US is stated to have labelled under the Federal Trade Commission Act, 
1914 numerous practices not known before. It was because a need was felt to ensure that the public was 
prevented from being made victims of false claims of products blatantly advertised even though it may not 
have an adverse effect on the competition. The effort was to shift the emphasis on detention and eradication 
of fraud against the consumers, particularly those belonging to the weaker sections of the society. 
Consumer Protection Law in India 
The Government enacted various laws to safeguard the interest of the consumers. The Essential 
Commodities Act, The Trade Marks Act, The Specific Relief Act, The Drugs Control Act, The Drugs and 
Cosmetics Act, The Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, The Emblems and 
Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, The Indian Standard Institution (Certification Marks) Act, The 
Agricultural Produce (Grading and Marketing) Act, The Standards of Weights and Measures Act, etc. are a 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
247 
few of the many laws intended to protect the interest of the consumer. Some of these laws alongwith the 
delegated legislation framed thereunder protect both the pecuniary interest as well as other interests of the 
consumer. Even the Indian Contract Act 1872 and the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 contain provisions for breach 
of contracts and remedies therefor. The Indian Penal Code provides for stringent punishment for certain 
offences. 
In the year 1986, the Government enacted the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and framed necessary rules 
thereunder, for facilitating the formation of Consumer Protection Councils in all states and setting up of 
Consumer Forums at district level, State Commission at state level and National Commission at national 
level for redressing the grievances of consumers. The Government also framed the MRTP (Recognition of 
Consumer Association) Rules and amended a number of economic legislations like the Essential 
Commodities Act, 1955; Standards of Weights and Measures Act, 1976; Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 
1954; Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 etc. to provide better protection to consumers. 
However, the passing of the MRTP Act, 1969, could be said to be the beginning of the Governments concern 
for consumer interest. Till the amendment of the Act in the year 1984, even the MRTP Act did not contain 
provisions directly aimed at protecting the interests of consumer, but they were intended to regulate 
competition in the hope that it would generate fair conduct, the effect of which would percolate to the ultimate 
consumer, the terminal point in the distributive line. 
Recommendations of Sachar Committee 
The Government of India appointed a Committee in August, 1977 under the Chairmanship of Justice 
Rajinder Sachar to look into the simplification of the working of the companies and the MRTP Act. The 
Committee submitted its report in the year 1978 and as far as recommendations pertaining to the MRTP Act 
are concerned, far reaching changes were suggested by the Committee. For the first time, the Committee 
highlighted the need for introduction of suitable provisions to curb unfair trade practices. 
In its view, the assumption that curbing monopolistic and restrictive trade practices and thereby preventing 
distortion of competition automatically results in the consumers getting a fair deal was only partly true. It was felt 
necessary to protect the consumers from practices adopted by trade and industry to mislead or dupe them. 
The Committee pointed out that advertisements and sales promotion having become well established modes 
of modern business techniques, representations through such advertisements to the consumer should not 
become deceptive. If a consumer was falsely induced to enter into buying goods which do not possess the 
quality and did not have the cure for the ailment advertised, it was apparent that the consumer was being 
made to pay for quality of things on false representation. Such a situation could not be accepted. 
Therefore, an obligation is to be cast on the seller to speak the truth when he advertises and also to avoid 
half truths, the purpose being preventing false or misleading advertisements. 
The Committee also noted that fictitious bargain was another common form of deception and many devices 
were used to lure buyers into believing that they were getting something for nothing or at a nominal value for 
their money. The Committee observed: Prices may be advertised as greatly reduced and cut when in reality 
the goods may be sold at sellers regular prices. Advertised statements that could have two meanings, one of 
which is false, are also considered misleading. In America, it was held that statement that a tooth paste fights 
decay could be interpreted as a promise of complete protection and was thus deceptive. Mock-ups on 
television put up by companies including Colgate Palmolive had also received the attention of the 
Enforcement Agencies in America and have been held to be deceptive. 
We cannot say that the type of misleading and deceptive practices which are to be found in other countries 
EP-EBCL 
248 
are not being practised in our country. Unfortunately our Act is totally silent on this aspect. The result is that 
the consumer has no protection against false or deceptive advertisements. Any misrepresentation about the 
quality of a commodity or the potency of a drug or medicine can be projected without much risk. This has 
created a situation of a very safe heaven for the suppliers and a position of frustration and uncertainty for the 
consumers. It should be the function of any consumers legislation to meet this challenge specifically. 
Consumer protection must have a positive and active role. 
Accordingly, the Committee specified certain unfair trade practices which were notorious and suggested 
prohibition of such practices. The main category of unfair trade practices recommended for prohibition by the 
Sachar Committee were: (a) misleading advertisements and false representations (b) bargain sale, bait and 
switch selling; (c) offering gifts or prizes with the intention of not providing them and conducting promotional 
contests; (d) supplying goods not conforming to safety standards; and (e) hoarding and destruction of goods. 
In India, by an amendment to the MRTP Act in the year 1984 Part B Unfair Trade Practices was added to 
Chapter V. It may be recalled that Part A of Chapter V deals with registration of agreements relating to 
restrictive trade practices. Section 36A, 36B, 36C, 36D and 36E are relevant for the purposes of 
understanding the main provisions relating to unfair trade practices. 
Scheme of the Act with respect to Unfair Trade Practices 
The term ‘Unfair Trade Practices’ is defined in Section 36A which enlists a number of practices as unfair 
trade practices. This definition has been amended vide the MRTP (Amendment) Act, 1991 making its scope 
wider in application. Section 36B provides for an enquiry into unfair trade practices by the MRTP 
Commission. Section 36C contains provision for preliminary investigation by the Director General in certain 
cases. Section 36D deals with the powers of the Commission to inquire into unfair trade practice and pass 
remedial orders. Section 36E empowers the Commission to exercise same powers in respect of unfair trade 
practices as it exercises in respect of restrictive trade practices. 
 
Why do we need competition in the market? 
Competition is now universally acknowledged as the best means of ensuring that 
consumers have access to the broadest range of services at the most competitive 
prices. Producers will have maximum incentive to innovate, reduce their costs and 
meet consumer demand. Competition thus promotes allocative and productive 
efficiency. But all this requires healthy market conditions and governments across 
the globe are increasingly trying to remove market imperfections through appropriate 
regulations to promote competition.

DEFINITIONS 
The important concepts incorporated in the Competition Act, 2002 have been defined under Section 2 of the 
Act. These have been discussed herein below: 
Acquisition 
This term has been specifically defined. It means – directly or indirectly, acquiring or agreeing to acquire: (i) 
shares, voting rights or assets of any enterprise; (ii) control over management or control over assets of any 
enterprise. [(Section 2(a)] 
The terms ‘acquiring’ or ‘acquisition’ are relevant for “Regulation of Combinations”. 
Agreement  
The term includes any arrangement or understanding or action in concert 
 
(i) whether or not, such arrangement, understanding or concert is in formal or in writing; or 
 
(ii) whether or not such arrangement, understanding or concert is intended to be enforceable by legal 
proceedings.  
It implies that an arrangement need not necessarily be in writing. The term is relevant in the context of 
Section 3, which envisages that anti-competitive agreements shall be void and thereby prohibited by the law. 
[Section 2(b)] 
The term “Competition” is not defined in the Act. However, in the corporate world, the term is generally 
understood as a process whereby the economic enterprises compete with each other to secure customers 
for their product. In the process, the enterprises compete to outsmart their competitors, sometimes to 
eliminate their rivals. Competition in the sense of economic rivalry is unstable and has a natural tendency to 
give way to a monopoly. Thus, competition kills competition. 
Cartel 
“Cartel” includes an association of producers, sellers or distributors, traders or service providers who, by 
agreement amongst themselves, limit control or attempt to control the production, distribution, sale or price of 
or, trade in goods or provision of services. [Section 2(c)] 
The nature of a cartel is to raise price above competitive levels, resulting in injury to consumers and to the 
economy. For the consumers, cartelisation results in higher prices, poor quality and less or no choice for 
goods or/and services. 
An international cartel is said to exist, when not all of the enterprises in a cartel are based in the same 
country or when the cartel affects markets of more than one country. 
EP-EBCL 
250 
An import cartel comprises enterprises (including an association of enterprises) that get together for the 
purpose of imports into the country. 
An export cartel is made up of enterprises based in one country with an agreement to cartelize markets in 
other countries. In the Competition Act, cartels meant exclusively for exports have been excluded from the 
provisions relating to anti-competitive agreements. This is because such cartels do not adversely affect 
markets in India and are hence outside the purview of the Competition Act. 
If there is effective competition in the market, cartels would find it difficult to be formed and sustained. 
 
Some of the conditions that are conducive to cartelization are: 
 
 
 high concentration - few competitors 
 high entry and exit barriers 
 homogeneity of the products (similar products) 
 similar production costs 
 excess capacity 
 high dependence of the consumers on the product 
 history of collusion 
Chairperson 
Chairperson means the Chairperson of Competition Commission of India appointed under Sub-section (1) of 
Section 8. [Section 2(d)] 
Commission 
Commission means Competition Commission of India established under Section 7(1). [Section 2(e)] 
Consumer 
Under that Act, the Consumer includes only such purchasers or buyers who make purchases for their own 
consumption or to earn their livelihood. This deficiency has now been made good – by defining “Consumer” 
under the Act. Consumer means any person who 
 
(i) buys any goods for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly 
promised, or under any system of deferred payment and includes any user of such goods other than 
the person who buys such goods for consideration paid or promised or under any system of 
deferred payment when such use is made with the approval of such person, whether such purchase 
of goods is for resale or for any commercial purpose or for personal use.  
 
(ii) hires or avails of any services for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid 
and partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment when such services are availed of 
with the approval of the first mentioned person whether such hiring or availing of services is for any 
commercial purpose or for personal use. [Section 2(f)] 
It may be noted that under the Competition Act even if a person purchases goods or avails of services for 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
251 
commercial purpose, he will be a Consumer, whereas for purposes of Consumer Protection Act, a person 
purchasing goods/availing services for commercial purposes is not a “Consumer” and can not seek relief 
under that Act.  
Director General 
Director General means the Director General appointed under Section 16(1) and includes Additional, Joint or 
Deputy or Assistant Director Generals. [Section 2(g)] 
Enterprise 
Enterprise means a person or a department of the Government, who or which is, engaged in any activity, 
relating to production, control of goods or articles or provision of services, of any kind, or in investment, or in 
the business of acquiring, holding, underwriting or dealing with shares, debentures or other securities 
whether such unit or division or subsidiary is located at the same place where the enterprise is located or at 
different place(s). 
However, it does not include any activity of the Central Government relating to sovereign functions of 
Government including all activities carried on by the Government Departments dealing with atomic energy, 
currency, defence and space.  
‘Activity’ includes profession or occupation. ‘A unit or division’ includes a plant or factory established for 
production, supply, distribution, acquisition or control of any goods or any branch or office established for 
provision of any service. [Section 2(h)] 
It may thus be noted that sovereign function of Government are excluded from definition of enterprise but 
Government Departments performing non-sovereign functions for consideration are subject to jurisdiction of 
Commission. 
Goods 
Goods means goods as defined in Sale of Goods Act, 1930 and includes 
 
(a) products manufactured, processed or mined;  
 
(b)  debentures, shares and stocks after allotment;  
 
(c) in relation to ‘goods supplied’, goods imported into India. [Section 2(i)] 
Member 
Member means a Member of the Commission appointed under Section 8(1) of the Act and includes a 
Chairperson. [Section 2(j)] 
Notification 
Notification means notification published in the Official Gazette. [Section 2(k)] 
Person 
Person includes (i) an individual; (ii) a Hindu undivided family; (iii) a company; (iv) a firm; (v) an association 
of persons; (vi) a corporation established under Central, State Act or a Government Company (vii) a body 
corporate incorporated by or under a law of a foreign country; (viii) a co-operative society registered under 
any Law (ix) local authority (x) every artificial juridical person. 
‘Government Company’ for this Section will be same as defined under Section 617 of Companies Act, 1956. 
[Section 2(p)] 
EP-EBCL 
252 
Practice 
Practice includes any practice relating to carrying on of any trade by a person or enterprise. [Section 2(p)] 
Prescribed 
Prescribed means prescribed by rules made under the Act by Central Government. [Section 2(n)] 
Price 
Price, in relation to sale of goods or supply of services, includes every valuable consideration, whether direct 
or indirect, or deferred, and includes any consideration, which relates to sale of any goods or to performance 
of any services although ostensibly relating to any other matter or thing. [Section 2(o)] 
Public Financial Institution 
Public Financial Institution means a Public Financial Institution as defined in Section 4A of Companies Act, 
1956 and includes a State Financial, Industrial or Investment corporation. [Section 2(p)] 
Regulations 
Regulations means the regulations made by the Competition Commission of India. [Section 2(q)] 
Relevant Market 
Relevant market means the market, which may be determined by the Commission with reference to ‘relevant 
product market’ or ‘relevant geographic market’ or with reference to both the markets. [Section 2(r)] 
Relevant Geographic Market 
Relevant Geographic Market means a market comprising the area in which the conditions of competition for 
supply of goods or provision of services or demand of goods or services are distinctly homogenous and can 
be distinguished from conditions prevailing in neighbouring areas. [Section 2(s)] 
Relevant Product Market 
Relevant Product Market means a market comprising of all those products or services which are regarded as 
interchangeable or substitutable by the consumer, by reasons of characteristics of products or services, their 
prices and intended use. [Section 2(t)] 
The terms ‘relevant market’, ‘relevant geographical market’ and ‘relevant product market’ have relevance in 
determination of the agreements being anti competitive, in evaluating combinations and dominance of an 
enterprise or group. An agreement in the nature of cartel which limits or controls production, supply, market, 
technical development, investments etc. need to be looked as being anti competitive with reference to 
relevant market. Similarly agreement to share the market or sources of production by way of allocation of 
geographical area of market, types of goods or services or number of customers in the market or by any 
similar way and these need to be interpreted in the context of the definition of relevant geographical market 
under Section 2(s). 
Service 
Service means service of any description which is made available to potential users and includes the 
provision of services in connection with business of any industrial or commercial matters such as banking, 
communication, education, financing, insurance, chit funds, real estate, transport, storage, material 
treatment, processing, supply of electrical or other energy, boarding, lodging, entertainment, amusement, 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
253 
construction, repair, conveying of news or information and advertising.  [Section 2(u)] 
It may be noted that under the Competition Act, the services of industrial or commercial nature also fall within 
the scope of the Act whereas under the Consumer Protection Act, the services of commercial nature or for 
business or industrial purposes are excluded for interpreting deficiency in the supply thereof and for 
determining compensation, if any, payable to them. To this extent, the relief claimable under the Consumer 
Protection Act, 1986 is limited in scope. It may also be noted that “education” has been specifically included 
in ambit of “Service” to set at rest the dispute, if any, about the jurisdiction of Commission in such matters. 
Shares 
Shares means shares in the share capital of a company carrying voting rights and includes, –  
 
(i) any security which entitles the holder to receive shares with voting rights;  
 
(ii) stock except where a distinction between stock and share is expressed or implied. [Section 2(v)] 
This definition of shares is much wider than what is provided under the Companies Act. It implies that not 
only shares in the share capital of a company e.g. equity or preference shares are included in the definition 
of shares but ‘debentures convertible into shares with voting rights’ are also included. 
Statutory Authority 
Statutory authority means any authority, board, corporation, council, institute, university or any other body 
corporate, established by or under any Central, State or Provincial Act for the purposes of regulating 
production or supply of goods or provision of any services or markets therefor or any matter connected 
therewith or incidental thereto.  [Section 2(w)] 
It implies that this definition widens the scope of type of bodies, which are empowered to make a reference 
for enquiring into anti-competitive agreement or abuse of dominant position or make a reference for opinion 
on a competition issue. 
Trade 
Trade means any ‘trade’, business, industry, profession or occupation relating to production, supplies, 
distribution, storage or control of goods and includes the provision of any services. 
The definition of the term ‘trade’ is relevant, inter-alia, to the interpretation of any of the type of agreement listed 
in Section 4 (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) in relation to the trading goods and provisions of services.  [Section 2(x)] 
Turnover 
Turnover includes value of sale of goods or services. [Section 2(y)] 
The definition of the term ’turnover’, inter-alia, is relevant and significant in determining whether the 
combination of merging entities exceeds the threshold limit of the turnover specified in Section 5 of the Act. It 
is also relevant for the purpose of imposition of fines by the Commission. 
Section 2 further provides that the words and expression used but not defined in the Competition Act, 2002 
and defined in the Companies Act, 1956 [(1) of 1956] shall have the same meaning respectively assigned to 
them in the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956). 
Chapter II of the Competition Act, 2002 stipulates provisions relating to Prohibition of Certain Agreements, 
Abuse of Dominant Position and Regulations of Combinations. 
Anti Competitive Agreements 
It is provided under Section 3(1) of the Competition Act that no enterprise or association of enterprises or 
EP-EBCL 
254 
person or association of persons shall enter into any agreement in respect of production, supply, 
distribution, storage, acquisition or control of goods or provision of services, which causes or is likely to 
cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition. Section 3(2) further declares that any anti competitive 
agreement within the meaning of sub-section 3(1) shall be void. Under the law, the whole agreement is 
construed as ‘void’ if it contains anti-competitive clauses having appreciable adverse effect on competition.  
Section 3(3) provides that following kinds of agreements entered into between enterprises or association 
of enterprises or persons or associations of persons or person or enterprise or practice carried on, or 
decision taken by any association of enterprises or association of persons, including “cartels”, engaged in 
identical or similar goods or services which –  
 
(a) directly or indirectly determines purchase or sale prices;  
 
(b) limits or controls production, supply, markets, technical development, investment or provision of 
services;  
 
(c) shares the market or source of production or provision of services by way of allocation of 
geographical area of market, or type of goods or services, or number of customers in the market or 
any other similar way; and  
 
(d) directly or indirectly results in bid rigging or collusive bidding; 
shall be presumed to have an appreciable adverse effect on the competition and onus to prove otherwise lies 
on the defendant. 
The explanation appended to the Section 3 defines the term ‘bid rigging’ as any agreement between 
enterprises or persons which has the effect of eliminating or reducing competition for bids or adversely 
affecting or manipulating the process for bidding. Efficiency enhancing joint ventures entered into by parties 
engaged in identical or similar goods or services, shall not be presumed to have appreciable adverse effect 
on competition but judged by rule of reason. The term “cartel” used in the Section is the most severe form of 
entering into ‘anti competitive agreements’ and has been defined in Section 2(c). 
Bid rigging takes place when bidders collude and keep the bid amount at a pre-determined level. Such pre-
determination is by way of intentional manipulation by the members of the bidding group. Bidders could be 
actual or potential ones, but they collude and act in concert. 
Bid rigging is anti-competitive 
Bidding, as a practice, is intended to enable the procurement of goods or services on the most favourable 
terms and conditions. Invitation of bids is resorted to both by Government (and Government entities) and 
private bodies (companies, corporations, etc.). But the objective of securing the most favourable prices and 
conditions may be negated if the prospective bidders collude or act in concert. Such collusive bidding or bid 
rigging contravenes the very purpose of inviting tenders and is inherently anti-competitive. 
 
Some of the most commonly adopted ways in which collusive bidding or bid rigging may occur are: 
 
• agreements to submit identical bids 
• agreements as to who shall submit the lowest bid, agreements for the submission of cover bids 
(voluntarily inflated bids) 
• agreements not to bid against each other, 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
255 
• agreements on common norms to calculate prices or terms of bids 
• agreements to squeeze out outside bidders 
• agreements designating bid winners in advance on a rotational basis, or on a geographical or 
customer allocation basis 
If bid rigging takes place in Government tenders, it is likely to have severe adverse effects on its purchases 
and on public spending. Bid rigging or collusive bidding is treated with severity in the law. The presumptive 
approach reflects the severe treatment. 
Section 3(4) provides that any agreement amongst enterprises or persons at different stages or levels of the 
production chain in different markets, in respect of production, supply, distribution, storage, sale or price of, 
or trade in goods or provision of services, including  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
shall be an agreement in contravention of sub-section (1) if such agreement causes or is likely to cause an 
appreciable adverse effect on competition in India. 
The term “tie-in agreement” includes any agreement requiring a purchaser of goods, as a condition of such 
purchase, to purchase some other goods. A good example of tie-in agreement is where a gas distributor 
requires a consumer to buy a gas stove as a pre condition to obtain connection of domestic cooking gas. 
[Chanakaya and Siddharth Gas company, In-re RTP 11/1985 decided by (MRTP Commission on 27.1.1985)] 
“Exclusive supply agreement” includes any agreement restricting in any manner from acquiring or 
otherwise dealing in any goods other than those of the seller or any other person. Thus, where a 
manufacturer asks a dealer not to deal in similar products of its competitor directly or indirectly and 
discontinues the supply on the ground that dealer also deals in product of suppliers’ competitor’s goods is an 
illustration of exclusive dealing agreement. [Bhartia Curtec Hammer Ltd. In-re (1997) 24 CLA 104 (MRTPC)]  
“Exclusive distribution agreement” includes any agreement to limit, restrict or withhold the output or 
supply of any goods or allocate any area or market for the disposal or sale of the goods. 
Requiring a distributor not to sell the goods of the manufacturer beyond the prescribed territory is a good

example of exclusive distribution agreement. Vadilal Enterprise Ltd. In-re (1998 (91) COMP CAS 824 is a 
good example of exclusive distribution agreement.  
“Refusal to deal” includes any agreement, which restricts, or is likely to restrict, by any method the persons 
or classes of persons to whom goods are sold or from whom goods are bought. For eg. an agreement which 
provides that the franchisees will not deal in products or goods of similar nature for a period of three years 
from the date of determination of agreement within a radius of five kms from showroom amounts to exclusive 
dealing agreement. DGIR v. Titan industries (2001) 43 CLA 293 MRTPC. 
“Resale price maintenance” includes any agreement to sell goods on condition that the prices to be 
charged on resale by the purchaser shall be the prices stipulated by the seller unless it is clearly stated that 
prices lower than those prices may be charged. 
Any stipulation that the cement dealer should not sell below the stipulated price is a ‘resale price 
maintenance’ practice and is an anti competitive practice. (In re-India Cement Ltd. RTP Inquiry 48 /1985). 
The agreements falling in Section 3(3) shall be presumed to have appreciable adverse affect on competition 
and thereby they are construed as deemed restrictive agreements. The agreements falling in Section 3(4) 
shall be judged by rule of reason and the onus lies on the prosecutor to prove its appreciable adverse effect 
on competition. The definition of all restrictive concepts covered under Section 3(4) is inclusive one. 
Moreover, Section 3 does not restrict the right of any person to restrain any infringement of or to impose 
reasonable conditions, as may be necessary for protecting any of his rights which have been or may be 
conferred upon him under 
 
(a) the Copyright Act, 1957; 
 
(b) the Patents Act, 1970; 
 
(c) the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 or the Trade Marks Act, 1999; 
 
(d) the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999; 
 
(e) the Designs Act, 2000; 
 
(f) the Semi-conductor Integrated Circuits Layout-Design Act, 2000.  
That apart, the Act does not restrict any person’s right to export from India goods under an agreement which 
requires him to exclusively supply, distribute or control goods or provision of services for fulfilling export 
contracts. The exclusion of ‘export business’ is in view of ‘effect theory’, and doctrine of ‘relevant market’. 
 
WHAT IS AN ANTI-COMPETITIVE AGREEMENT? 
An anti-competitive agreement is an agreement having appreciable adverse effect on 
competition. Anti-competitive agreements include, but are not limited to:- 
• agreement to limit production and/or supply; 
• agreement to allocate markets; 
• agreement to fix price; 
• bid rigging or collusive bidding; 
• conditional purchase/ sale (tie-in arrangement); 
• exclusive supply / distribution arrangement; 
• resale price maintenance; and 
• refusal to deal. 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
257 
Prohibition of abuse of dominant position 
Section 4 of the Competition Act, 2002 expressly prohibits any enterprise or group from abusing its dominant 
position, meaning thereby a position of strength, enjoyed by an enterprise or group, in the relevant market, in 
India, which enables it to– 
 
(i) operate independently of competitive forces prevailing in the relevant market; or 
 
(ii) affect its competitors or consumers or the relevant market in its favour”.  
In line with the latest global trend, the dominance shall not be determined with reference to “assets”, 
“turnover” or “market share”. 
As per Section 2(r) ‘relevant market’ means the market, which may be determined by the Commission with 
reference to the relevant ‘product market’ or ‘relevant geographic market’ or with reference to both the 
markets. Thus, for determining dominance, these are relevant concepts.  
The term “enterprise” means a person or a department of the Government, who or which is, or has been, 
engaged in any activity, relating to the production, storage, supply, distribution, acquisition or control of 
articles or goods, or the provision of services, of any kind, or in investment, or in the business of acquiring, 
holding, underwriting or dealing with shares, debentures or other securities of any other body corporate, 
either directly or through one or more of its units or divisions or subsidiaries, whether such unit or division or 
subsidiary is located at the same place where the enterprise is located or at a different place or at different 
places, but does not include any activity of the Government relatable to the sovereign functions of the 
Government including all activities carried on by the departments of the Central Government dealing with 
atomic energy, currency, defence and space. 
For the purposes of this clause, “activity” includes profession or occupation; “article” includes a new article 
and “service” includes a new service; “unit” or “division”, in relation to an enterprise, includes— 
 
(i) a plant or factory established for the production, storage, supply, distribution, acquisition or control 
of any article or goods; 
 
(ii) any branch or office established for the provision of any service. 
Section 4(2) states that there shall be abuse of dominant position, if an enterprise or group  
 
(a) directly or indirectly imposes unfair or discriminatory; 
 
(i) condition in purchase or sale of goods or services; or  
 
(ii) price in purchase or sale (including predatory price) of goods or service.  
Explanation appended to Section 4 (2) clarifies that the unfair or discriminatory condition in purchase or sale 
of goods or services shall not include any discriminatory condition or price which may be adopted to meet the 
competition. 
Section 4(2)(b) includes in abuse of dominant position an enterprise or group limiting or restricting 
 
(i) production of goods or provision of services or market therefore; or 
 
(ii) technical or scientific development relating to goods or services to the prejudice of consumers.  
Similarly Section 4 (2) (c), (d) and (e) specify three other forms of abuses namely, if any person indulges in 
practice or practices resulting in denial of market access in any manner; or makes conclusion of contracts 
EP-EBCL 
258 
subject to acceptance by other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to 
commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts and also, if any person uses 
dominant position in one relevant market to enter into, or protect, other relevant market. 
The term “predatory price” has been defined as the sale of goods or provision of services, at a price which is 
below the cost, as may be determined by regulations, of production of goods or provision of services, with a 
view to reduce competition or eliminate the competitors. Thus, the two conditions precedent to bring a case 
with the ambit of predatory pricing are: 
 
(i) selling goods or provision of service at a price which is below its cost of production and  
 
(ii) that practice is resorted to eliminate the competitors or to reduce competition. 
The Competition Commission of India has been empowered under Section 19(4) of the Act to determine 
whether any enterprise or group enjoys a dominant position or not, in the ‘relevant market’ and also to decide 
whether or not there has been an abuse of dominant position. It may be noted that mere existence of 
dominance is not to be frowned upon unless the dominance is abused. 
 
WHAT CONSTITUTES ABUSE OF DOMINANCE? 
Dominance refers to a position of strength which enables an enterprise to operate 
independently of competitive forces or to affect its competitors or consumers or the 
market in its favour. Abuse of dominant position impedes fair competition between 
firms, exploits consumers and makes it difficult for the other players to compete with 
the dominant undertaking on merit. Abuse of dominant position includes: 
• imposing unfair conditions or price, 
• predatory pricing, 
• limiting production/market or technical development , 
• creating barriers to entry, 
• applying dissimilar conditions to similar transactions, 
• denying market access, and 
• using dominant position in one market to gain advantages in another market. 
Combinations 
Combination has broad coverage and includes acquisition of control, shares, voting rights, assets, merger or 
amalgamation.  
 
WHAT IS COMBINATION? 
Broadly, combination under the Act means acquisition of control, shares, voting rights 
or assets, acquisition of control by a person over an enterprise where such person 
has direct or indirect control over another enterprise engaged in competing 
businesses, and mergers and amalgamations between or amongst enterprises when 
the combining parties exceed the thresholds set in the Act. The thresholds are 
specified in the Act in terms of assets or turnover in India and outside India. Entering 
into a combination which causes or is likely to cause an appreciable adverse effect 
on competition within the relevant market in India is prohibited and such combination shall be void. 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
259 
Threshold of Combination specified under section 5 of the Act in tabular form given below: 
On March 4, 2016, the Central Government issued notifications pertaining to the statutory thresholds for the 
purposes of “combinations” under Section 5 of the Competition Act, 2002(“Act”). 
 
1. Increase in thresholds: Pursuant to Notification No. S.O. 675(E) dated March 4, 2016, the value of 
assets and the value of turnover has been enhanced by 100% for the purposes of Section 5 of the 
Act. Accordingly, the revised thresholds for notification to the Competition Commission of India 
(“Commission”) are:

1. Increase in thresholds of De Minimis Exemption: Pursuant to Notification No. S.O. 674 (E)dated 
March 4, 2016, acquisitions where enterprises whose control, shares, voting rights or assets are 
being acquired have assets of not more than Rs. 350 crore in India or turnover of not more than Rs. 
1000 crore in India, are exempt from Section 5 of the Act for a period of 5 years. Accordingly, the 
revised threshold for availing of the De Minimis exemption for acquisitions are:

1. Definition of Group: As per Notification No. S.O. 673 (E) dated March 4, 2016, the exemption to 
the “group” exercising less than fifty per cent of voting rights in other enterprise from the provisions 
of Section 5 of the Act under Notification No. S.O. 481 (E) dated March4, 2011, has been continued 
for a further period of 5 years. 
Regulation of Combinations 
Section 6 of the Competition Act prohibits any person or enterprise from entering into a combination which 
causes or is likely to cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition within the relevant market in India 
EP-EBCL 
260 
and if such a combination is formed, it shall be void. Section 6(2) envisages that any person or enterprise, 
who or which proposes to enter into any combination, shall give a notice to the Commission disclosing 
details of the proposed combination, in the form, prescribed and submit the form together with the fee 
prescribed by regulations. Such intimation should be submitted within 30 days of 
 
(a) approval of the proposal relating to merger or amalgamation, referred to in Section 5(c), by the board 
of directors of the enterprise concerned with such merger or amalgamation, as the case may be; 
 
(b) execution of any agreement or other document for acquisition referred to in Section 5(a) or 
acquiring of control referred to in Section 5(b).  
A newly inserted sub-section (2A) envisages that no combination shall come into effect until 210 days have 
passed from the day of notice or the Commission has passed orders, whichever is earlier. 
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has been empowered to deal with such notice in accordance 
with provisions of Sections 29, 30 and 31 of the Act. Section 29 prescribes procedure for investigation of 
combinations. Section 30 empowers the Commission to determine whether the disclosure made to it under 
Section 6(2) is correct and whether the combination has, or is likely to have, an appreciable adverse effect 
on the competition. Section 31 provides that the Commission may allow the combination if it will not have any 
appreciable adverse effect on competition or pass an order that the combination shall not take effect, if in its 
opinion, such a combination has or is likely to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition. 
The provisions of Section 6 do not apply to share subscription or financing facility or any acquisition, by a 
public financial institution, foreign institutional investor, bank or venture capital fund, pursuant to any 
covenant of a loan agreement or investment agreement. This exemption appears to have been provided in 
the Act to facilitate raising of funds by an enterprise in the course of its normal business. Under Section 6(5), 
the public financial institution, foreign institutional investor, bank or venture capital fund, are required to file in 
prescribed form, details of the control, the circumstances for exercise of such control and the consequences 
of default arising out of loan agreement or investment agreement, within seven days from the date of such 
acquisition or entering into such agreement, as the case may be. 
As per the explanation appended to Section 6(5) 
 
(a) “foreign institutional investor” has the same meaning as assigned to it in clause (a) of the 
Explanation to Section 115AD of the Income-tax Act, 1961; 
 
(b) “venture capital fund” has the same meaning as assigned to it in clause (b) of the Explanation to 
clause (23 FB) of Section 10 of the Income-tax Act, 1961.  
It may be noted that under the law, the combinations are only regulated whereas anti-competitive 
agreements and abuse of dominance are prohibited. Further, under the MRTP Act prior to 27.9.91, 
undertakings of certain size were required to be registered and such undertakings were required to seek 
prior approval of the Central Government before embarking upon expansion plans. In the present Act, there 
is no requirement of registration of an undertaking and further, there is no need to have prior approval of the 
Central Government but CCI will only examine as to whether or not combination is or is likely to have an 
appreciable adverse effect on competition.  
The Competition Act with many innovative concepts coupled with power to impose fine is likely to let in harsh 
glare of sunlight to disinfect pernicious anti-competitive practices. 
Competition Commission of India 
 
Establishment of Commission 
The Central Government under Section 7 has been empowered to establish a Commission to be called 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
261 
“Competition Commission of India” by issue of a Notification. The Commission is a body corporate having 
perpetual succession and a common seal. The Commission has power to acquire, hold movable or 
immovable property and to enter into contract in its name and by the said name, sue or be sued. In the 
premises, the set up of Commission corresponds to that of Securities & Exchange Board of India constituted 
under the SEBI Act, 1992. 
The Head Office of the Commission shall be at such place as the Central Government may decide from time 
to time. Vide Notification: SO 1198(E) dated 14th Oct., 2003, the Central Government established the 
Competition Commission of India having its Head Office at New Delhi. 
The Commission has also been authorized to establish its office at other places in India. Thus, the law 
provides for setting up of CCI’s offices at places other than that of its Headquarter. 
Composition of Commission 
The composition of the Commission as spelled out under Section 8 of the Act consists of a Chairperson and not 
less than two and not more than six other Members. The Chairperson and the Members are to be appointed by 
the Central Government. Regarding the qualifications of the Chairman and other Members, Section 8(2) 
provides that they shall be person of ability, integrity and standing and who has special knowledge of and such 
professional experience of not less than fifteen years in international trade, economics, business, commerce, 
law, finance, accountancy, management, industry, public affairs or competition matters including competition 
law and policy which in the opinion of the Central Government, may be useful to the Commission. The 
Chairperson and other Members are to be appointed on whole time basis. 
Selection of Chairperson and Members of Commission 
Section 9(1) envisages that the Chairperson and other Members of the Commission shall be appointed by 
the Central Government from a panel of names recommended by a Selection Committee consisting of the 
Chief Justice of India or his nominee, as Chairperson; and the Secretary in the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, 
Member; the Secretary in the Ministry of Law and Justice, Member; and two experts of repute who have 
special knowledge of, and professional experience in international trade, economics, business, commerce,

Term of office of Chairperson and other Members 
The Act stipulates that the Chairperson and every other Member shall hold office as such for a term of 
five years from the date on which he enters upon his office and shall be eligible for re-appointment. 
However, the Chairperson or other Members shall not hold office as such after he has attained the age 
of sixty-five years. 
A vacancy caused by the resignation or removal of the Chairperson or any other Member under section 11 or 
by death or otherwise shall be filled by fresh appointment in accordance with the provisions of sections 8 and 
9. The Chairperson and every other Member shall, before entering upon his office, make and subscribe to an 
oath of office and of secrecy in such form, manner and before such authority, as may be prescribed. 
In the event of the occurrence of a vacancy in the office of the Chairperson by reason of his death, 
resignation or otherwise, the senior-most Member shall act as the Chairperson, until the date on which a new 
Chairperson, appointed in accordance with the provisions of this Act to fill such vacancy, enters upon his 
office. When the Chairperson is unable to discharge his functions owing to absence, illness or any other 
cause, the senior-most Member shall discharge the functions of the Chairperson until the date on which the 
Chairperson resumes the charge of his functions. 
EP-EBCL 
262 
Resignation of Chairperson etc. 
It has been provided under section 11 that the Chairperson or any other Member may resign his office by 
notice in writing under his hand addressed to the Central Government. However, until the Chairperson or a 
Member is permitted by the Central Government to relinquish his office, he will continue to hold his office 
until the expiry of three months from the date of receipt of such notice or until a person duly appointed as a 
successor enters into his office or until the expiry of his term, which ever is the earliest. Under Section 11(2), 
it is provided that in the following circumstances the Central Government may, by order, remove the 
Chairperson or any Member from his office if such Chairman or Member as the case may be, - 
 
(a) is, or at any time has been, adjudged as an insolvent; or 
 
(b) has engaged at any time, during his term of office, in any paid employment; or  
 
(c) has been convicted of an offence which, in the opinion of the Central Government, involves moral 
turpitude; or 
 
(d) has acquired such financial or other interest as it likely to affect prejudicially his functions as a 
Member; or 
 
(e) has so abused his position as to render his continuance in office prejudicial to the public interest; or 
 
(f) has become physically or mentally incapable of acting as a Member. 
However, no Member shall be removed from his office on the ground that he has acquired such financial or 
other interest as is likely to affect prejudicially his function as a Member or has so abused his position as to 
render his continuance in public office prejudicial to the public interest unless the Supreme Court, on a 
reference being made to it in this behalf by the Central Government, has on an inquiry as prescribed 
reported that the Member ought on such ground or grounds to be removed. 
Section 12 provides that for a period of two years from the date on which the Chairperson and other Member 
cease to hold office shall not accept any appointment in or connected with the management or administration 
of, any enterprise which has been a party to the proceeding before the Commission. This restriction, 
however, shall not apply to any employment under the Central Government or a State Government or local 
authority or any corporation established by or under any Central, State or Provincial Act or a Government 
company as defined in Section 617 of the Companies Act, 1956 (10 of 1956). 
Financial and Administrative Powers of Member Administration 
A Member of the Commission as per Section 13 may be designated by the Central Government as Member 
Administration who shall exercise such financial and administrative powers as may be vested in him under 
the rules made by the Central Government. However, the Member Administration shall have authority to 
delegate such of his financial and administrative powers to any other officer of the Commission as he may 
deem fit subject to the condition that, while exercising delegated powers such official shall continue to act 
under the direction, superintendence and control of the Member Administration. 
Salary and Terms and Conditions of Service 
The salary allowances and other terms and conditions of service of the Chairman and other member including 
travel expenses, house rent allowance, conveyance facility, sumptuary allowance and medical facilities shall be 
such as may be prescribed. Further, to ensure freedom in the functioning of the Chairperson and the Member, 
Section 14(2) provides that the salary allowance and other terms and conditions of service of the Chairperson 
or Member shall not be varied to his disadvantage after his appointment. 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
263 
No act or proceedings of the Commission shall be invalid merely because there is any vacancy in the 
Commission or defect in the constitution of the Commission; or any defect in the appointment of Chairperson 
or a Member; or any irregularity in the procedure of the Commission not affecting the merits of the case. 
Appointment of Director General 
Director General is an important functionary under the Act. He is to assist the Commission in conducting 
inquiry into contravention of any of the provisions of the Act and for performing such other functions as are, 
or may be, provided by or under the Act. 
Section 16 (1) empowers the Central Government to appoint a Director General and such number of 
additional, joint, deputy or assistant Director Generals or other advisers, consultants or officers for the 
purposes of assisting the Commission in conducting inquiry into the contravention of any provision of the Act.  
Additional, joint, deputy and assistant Director Generals, other advisors, consultants and officers shall 
however, exercise powers and discharge functions subject to the general control, supervision and directions 
of the Director General. 
The salary, allowances and other terms and conditions and service of Director General, consultants, advisors 
or other officers assisting him shall be such as may be prescribed by the Central Government. The Director 
General, advisers, consultants and officers assisting him are to be appointed from amongst the persons of 
integrity and outstanding ability and who have experience in investigation, and knowledge of accountancy, 
management, business, public administration, international trade, law or economics and such other 
qualifications as may be prescribed.  
The Commission may appoint a Secretary and such officers and other employees, as it considers necessary 
for the efficient performance of his functions under the Act. The Commission may engage, in accordance 
with the procedure specified by regulations, such number of experts and professionals of integrity and 
outstanding ability, who have special knowledge of, and experience in, economics, law, business or such 
other disciplines related to competition, as it deems necessary to assist the Commission in the discharge of 
its functions under the Act. 
Duties, Powers and Functions of Commission 
As per Section 18 of the Act, duties of the CCI are: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EP-EBCL 
264 
Section 18 empowers the Commission to enter into any memorandum or arrangement, with the prior 
approval of the Central Government, for the purpose of discharging the duties and functions under this Act 
with any agency of any foreign country. This will enable the CCI to have extra territorial reach and shall 
facilitate exchange of information and enforcement of its order. 
Inquiry into certain agreements and dominant position of enterprise 
The Commission may inquire into any alleged contravention of Section 3(1) or 4(1) on its own motion or on  
 
(a) receipt of any information in such manner and accompanied by such fee, from any person, 
consumer or consumer association or trade association; or  
 
(b) a reference made to it by the Central Government or State Government or a statutory authority. 
The Director General is not vested with a right to move an application for institution of an enquiry relating to 
anti-competitive agreements or abuse of dominance. 
The terms ‘person’ and ‘statutory authority’ have been defined under Sections 2(l) and 2(w) respectively. The 
term ‘person’ has been given wide connotation and it includes an individual, a HUF, a company, a firm, an 
association of persons, any corporation established under any Central, State or Provincial Act or a 
Government company, a co-operative society, a local authority and every artificial juridical person.  
 
Section 19(3) provides that while determining whether an agreement has appreciable adverse effect on 
competition, the Commission shall give due regard to all or any of the following factors, namely– 
 
 
 
 
 
(a) creation of barriers to new entrants in the market; 
 
(b) driving existing competitors out of the market; 
 
(c) foreclosure of competition by hindering entry into the market; 
 
(d) accrual of benefits to consumers; 
 
(e) improvements in production or distribution of goods or provision of services; 
 
(f) promotion of technical, scientific and economic development by means of production or 
distribution of goods or provision of services. 
The first three factors are anti-competitive, while the latter three factors deal with benign effects. 
“Adverse appreciable affect on competition” is a key factor while enquiring into anti-competitive agreement. 
The touch stone of appreciable adverse effect on competition need not be proved while enquiring into abuse 
of dominance. 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
265 
For the purpose of determining whether an enterprise enjoys dominant position or not under Section 4, the 
Commission shall have due regard to all or any of the following factors, namely – 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a) market share of the enterprise; 
 
(b) size and resources of the enterprise; 
 
(c) size and importance of the competitors; 
 
(d) economic power of the enterprise including commercial advantages over competitors; 
 
(e) vertical integration of the enterprises or sale or service network of such enterprises; 
 
(f) dependence of consumers on the enterprise; 
 
(g) monopoly or dominant position whether acquired as a result of any statute or by virtue of being a 
Government company or a public sector undertaking or otherwise; 
 
(h) entry barriers including barriers such as regulatory barriers, financial risk, high capital cost of 
entry, marketing entry barriers, technical entry barriers, economies of scale, high cost of 
substitutable goods or service for consumers; 
 
(i) countervailing buying power; 
 
(j) market structure and size of market; 
 
(k) social obligations and social costs; 
 
(l) relative advantage, by way of the contribution to the economic development, by the enterprise 
enjoying a dominant position having or likely to have an appreciable adverse effect on 
competition; 
 (m) any other factor which the Commission may consider relevant for the inquiry. 
The present law makes explicit the issues and the parameters which will be considered while deciding 
“abuse of dominance”. The Commission shall have due regard to the, “relevant geographic market” and 
“relevant product market” for determining as to what constitutes a “relevant market”. 
The terms ‘relevant market’ and “relevant geographic market” have been defined in Sections 2 (r) and 2(s) of 
the Act. For determining the “relevant geographic market”, the Commission shall have due regard to 
all or any of the following factors, namely;─ 
 
(a) regulatory trade barriers; 
 
(b) local specification requirements; 
 
(c) national procurement policies; 
EP-EBCL 
266 
 
(d) adequate distribution facilities; 
 
(e) transport costs; 
 
(f) language; 
 
(g) consumer preferences; 
 
(h) need for secure, regular supplies or rapid after-sales service. 
Similarly, while determining ‘relevant product market’ the Commission shall have due regard to all or any of 
the following factors namely;  
 
(a) physical characteristics or end-use of goods; 
 
(b) price of goods or service; 
 
(c) consumer preferences; 
 
(d) exclusion of in-house production; 
 
(e) existence of specialized producers; 
 
(f) classification of industrial products. 
The prescription of parameters for determining “appreciable adverse effect” on competition of agreement, 
“dominant position”, within “relevant market”, are intended to bring consistency and certainty in the working 
of the Commission which has to consider all or any of the applicable factors, as the case may be. It is quite 
apparent that any inquiry by the CCI will be a detailed exercise, which will not only involve gathering of 
information in regard to technological or marketing factors but also the government policy which relate to the 
trade or business in which the enterprise is involved beside global scenario especially with regard to 
regulatory trade barriers including import-export policy, tariff and subsidy issues will also be taken into 
account by the Commission. 
Inquiry into Combination by Commission 
The Commission under Section 20 of the Competition Act may inquire into the appreciable adverse 
effect caused or likely to be caused on competition in India as a result of combination either upon its 
own knowledge or information (suo motu) or upon receipt of notice under Section 6(2) relating to 
acquisition referred to in Section 5(a) or acquiring of control referred to in Section 5(b) or merger or 
amalgamation referred to in Section 5(c) of the Act. It has also been provided that an enquiry shall be 
initiated by the Commission within one year from the date on which such combination has taken effect. 
Thus, the law has provided a time limit within which suo moto inquiry into combinations can be initiated. 
This provision dispels the fear of enquiry into combination between merging entities after the expiry of 
stipulated period. 
On receipt of the notice under Section 6(2) from the person or an enterprise which proposes to enter into a 
combination, it is mandatory for the Commission to inquire whether the combination referred to in that notice, 
has caused or is likely to cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition in India. 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
267 
The Commission shall have due regard to all or any of the factors for the purposes of determining whether 
the combination would have the effect of or is likely to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition in 
the relevant market, namely 
 
 
 
(a) actual and potential level of competition through imports in the market; 
 
(b) extent of barriers to entry into the market; 
 
(c) level of combination in the market; 
 
(d) degree of countervailing power in the market; 
 
(e) likelihood that the combination would result in the parties to the combination being able to 
significantly and sustainably increase prices or profit margins; 
 
(f) extent of effective competition likely to sustain in a market; 
 
(g) extent to which substitutes are available or are likely to be available in the market; 
 
(h) market share, in the relevant market, of the persons or enterprise in a combination, individually 
and as a combination; 
 
(i) likelihood that the combination would result in the removal of a vigorous and effective competitor 
or competitors in the market; 
 
(j) nature and extent of vertical integration in the market; 
 
(k) possibility of a failing business; 
 
(l) nature and extent of innovation; 
 (m) relative advantage, by way of the contribution to the economic development, by any combination 
having or likely to have appreciable adverse effect on competition; 
 
(n) whether the benefits of the combination outweigh the adverse impact of the combination, if any. 
The above yardsticks are to be taken into account irrespective of fact whether an inquiry is instituted, on 
receipt of notice under Section 6(2) upon its own knowledge. The scope of assessment of adverse effect on 
competition will be confined to the “relevant market”. Most of the facts enumerated in Section 20 (4) are 
external to an enterprise. It is noteworthy that sub clause (n) of Section 20 (4) requires to invoke principles of 
a “balancing”. It requires the Commission to evaluate whether the benefits of the combination outweigh the 
adverse impact of the combination, if any. In other words if the benefits of the combination outweigh the 
adverse effect of the combination, the Commission will approve the combination. Conversely, the 
Commission may declare such a combination as void. 
Reference by statutory authority 
The term “statutory authority” has been defined in Section 2(w). If in the course of a proceeding before any 
statutory authority, an issue is raised by any party that any decision which such authority has taken or 
proposes to take, is or would be, contrary to the provisions of the Competition Act 2002, it may make a 
reference in respect of such issue to the Commission and seek its opinion. The Commission shall, on receipt 
of the reference, after hearing the parties to the proceedings, give its opinion within 60 days of receipt of 
such reference to such authority on the issues referred to it. The statutory authority shall thereafter pass 
EP-EBCL 
268 
such order on the issues referred to the Commission as it deems fit. The statutory authority may, suo motu 
make such reference in respect of such issue to the Commission. Likewise, the Commission either in the 
course of proceedings before it or suo motu may make a reference for opinion to a statutory authority and 
the latter has to render its opinion within 60 days of making a reference. 
Meetings of Commission 
Section 22 provides that the Commission shall meet at such times and places, and shall observe such rules 
and procedure in regard to the transaction of business at its meetings as may be provided by regulations. 
The Chairperson, if for any reason, is unable to attend a meeting of the Commission, the senior-most 
Member present at the meeting, shall preside at the meeting. All questions which come up before any 
meeting of the Commission shall be decided by a majority of the Members present and voting, and in the 
event of an equality of votes, the Chairperson or in his absence, the Member presiding, shall have a second 
or/casting vote. However, the quorum for such meeting shall be three Members. 
Procedure for inquiry on complaints under Section 19 
If the Commission is of the opinion that there exists a prima facie case, on receipt of an information from any 
person, consumer, their association or trade association or on a reference from Central Government or State 
Government or of a statutory authority or on its knowledge or information under Section 19, it shall direct the 
Director General to cause an investigation to be made into the matter. The Director General shall investigate 
into the matter and submit a report of its findings within the period as may be specified by the Commission. It 
is, however, not binding on the Commission to accept the report of the Director General. 
Where upon receipt of a reference or information, the Commission is of the opinion that there is no prima-
facie case, it shall pass an order dismissing the reference/information, as it deems fit and necessary.  
Upon receipt of a report from the Director General, the Commission shall forward a copy thereof to (a) the 
parties concerned or (b) Central Government or (c) State Government or (d) statutory authority as the case 
may be. If the Director General, in relation to a matter referred to it, recommends that there is no 
contravention of any of the provisions of the Act, the Commission shall give an opportunity of hearing to the 
informant and after hearing, if the Commission agrees with the recommendation of the Director General, it 
shall dismiss the information. According to Section 26(7) if, after hearing information provider, the 
Commission is of the opinion that further inquiry is called for, it shall direct the enquiry to proceed further. 
Where the report of the Director General relates to matter referred to Commission by the Central 
Government or a State Government or a statutory authority and the report contains recommendation that 
there is no contravention of the provisions of the Act, the Commission shall invite the comments of the 
Central Government or the State Government or statutory authority, as the case may be, on such report. On 
receipt of the comments, if there is no prima-facie case, in the opinion of the Commission the Commission 
shall return the reference. However, if the Commission feels that there is a prima-facie case it shall proceed 
with a reference. 
Section 26(9) provides that the Commission on receipt of recommendation of Director General that there is 
contravention of any of the provisions of the Act, and a further inquiry is called for, shall inquire into such 
contravention in accordance with the provisions of the Act. 
The provisions of the Section indicate that it is mandatory that information or reference received or a matter 
which comes to the knowledge of the Commission regarding alleged violation of the provisions of the Act, 
must be referred to the Director General for an investigation in the matter. A copy of the report of the Director 
General is required to be sent to the information provider or to the Central Government or State Government 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
269 
or a statutory authority, as the case may be, for their comments and an opportunity of hearing is required to 
be given to the parties as this is warranted by the principles of natural justice. Where the Director General 
recommends that there is contravention of any of the provisions of the Act, and that the Commission is of 
opinion that further inquiry is called for, it shall institute an inquiry into the matter and pass a reasoned order. 
The Commission may or may not subscribe to the recommendations of the Director General. 
Orders by Commission after inquiry into agreements or abuse of dominant position 
Section 27 envisages that the Commission after any inquiry into agreement entered into by any enterprise or 
association of enterprises or person or association of persons, or an inquiry into abuse of dominant position 
may pass all or any of the following orders, namely, 
 
(i) direct that such agreement, or abuse of dominant position shall be discontinued and such 
agreement, which is in contravention of Section 3 shall not be re-entered or the abuse of dominant 
position in contravention of Section 4 shall be discontinued, as the case may be. The direction to 
discontinue and not to recur is commonly known as “Cease & desist” order. 
 
(ii) the Commission may impose penalty not exceeding ten percent of the average turnover of last three 
preceding financial years, upon each of person or enterprises which are parties to such agreement 
in contravention of Section 3 or are abusing dominant position within meaning of Section 4. 
 
 In case any agreement which is prohibited by Section 3 has been entered into by any cartel, the 
Commission may impose upon each producer, seller, distributor, trader or service provider 
participating in that cartel, a penalty up to three times of its profits for each year of the continuance 
of such agreement whichever is higher. 
 
(iii) The Commission may direct that the agreements shall stand modified to the extent and in the 
manner as specified in the order. 
 
(iv) The Commission may direct the enterprises concerned to comply with such other orders and 
directions, including payment of cost, if any, as it deems fit. 
 
(v) to pass such order or issue such directions as it may deem fit.

order in writing, direct division of an enterprise enjoying dominant position to ensure that such enterprise or 
group does not abuse its dominant position.  
The order of the Commission referred to above may provide for all or any of the following matters, namely 
 
(a) the transfer or vesting of property, rights, liabilities or obligations; 
 
(b) the adjustment of contracts either by discharge or reduction of any liability or obligation or otherwise; 
 
(c) the creation, allotment, surrender or cancellation of any shares, stocks or securities; 
 
(d) the formation or winding up of an enterprise or the amendment of the memorandum of association 
or articles of association or any other instruments regulating the business of any enterprise; 
 
(e) the extent to which, and the circumstances in which, provisions of the order affecting an enterprise 
may be altered by the enterprise and the registration thereof; 
 
(f) any other matter which may be necessary to give effect to the division of the enterprise or group.

Procedure for investigation of combination 
The procedure for investigation by the Commission has been stipulated under Section 29 of the Act. It 
involves following stages - 
 
(i) The Commission first has to form a prima facie opinion that a combination is likely to cause, or has 
caused an appreciable adverse effect on competition within the relevant market in India. Further, 
when the Commission has come to such a conclusion then it shall proceed to issue a notice to the 
parties to the combination, calling upon them to show cause why an investigation in respect of such 
combination should not be conducted; 
 
(ii) After receipt of the response of the parties to the combination Commission may call for the report of 
the Director General. 
 
(iii) When pursuant to response of parties or on receipt of report of the Director General whichever is 
later, the Commission prima-facie is of the opinion that the Combination is likely to cause an 
appreciable adverse effect on competition in relevant market, it shall, within seven days direct the 
parties to the combination to publish within ten working days, the details of the combination, in such 
manner as it thinks appropriate so as, to bring to the information of public and persons likely to be 
affected by such combination. 
 
(iv) The Commission may invite any person affected or likely to be affected by the said combination, to 
file his written objections within fifteen working days of the publishing of the public notice, with the 
Commission for its consideration. 
 
(v) The Commission may, within fifteen working days of the filing of written objections, call for such 
additional or other information as it deem fit from the parties to the said combination and the 
information shall be furnished by the parties above referred within fifteen days from the expiry of the 
period notified by the Commission.  
 
(vi) After receipt of all the information and within forty-five days from expiry of period for filing further 
information, the Commission shall proceed to deal with the case, in accordance with provisions 
contained in Section 31 of the Act. 
Thus, the provisions of Section 29 provide for a specified timetable within which the parties to the 
combination or parties likely to be affected by the combination are required to submit the information or 
further information to the Commission to ensure prompt and timely conduct of the investigation. It further 
imposes on Commission a time limit of forty-five working days from the receipt of additional or other 
information called for by it under sub-Section (4) of Section 29 for dealing with the case of investigation into a 
combination, which may have an adverse effect of the competition. 
Inquiry into disclosures under Section 6(2) 
Section 6(2) casts an obligation on any person or enterprise, who or which proposes to enter into 
combination, shall give notice to the Commission, in the form as may be specified, and the fee which may be 
determined, by regulations, disclosing the details of the proposed combination within thirty days of— 
 
(i) approval of the proposal relating to merger or amalgamation by the board of directors of the 
enterprises concerned with such merger or amalgamation; 
 
(ii)  execution of any agreement or other document for acquisition referred to in Section 5(a) or 
acquiring of control referred to in Section 5(b). 
Non-filing of notice attracts penalty in terms of Section 43A of the Act. 
The newly inserted section 6(2A) envisages that no combination shall come into effect until two hundred and 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
271 
ten days have passed from the day on which notice has been given to Commission or the Commission has 
passed orders, whichever is earlier. 
Upon receipt of such notice, the Commission shall examine such notice and form its prima facie opinion as to 
whether the combination has, or is likely to have, an appreciable adverse effect on the competition in the 
relevant market in India. 
Orders of Commission on Certain Combinations 
The Commission, after consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances of the case under investigation, 
by it under Sections 28 or 30 and assessing the effect of any combination on the relevant market in India, 
may pass any of the written orders indicated herein below. Where the Commission comes to a conclusion 
that any combination does not, or is not likely to, have an appreciable adverse effect on the Competition in 
relevant market in India, it may, approve that Combination. 
 
(i) In the case where the Commission is of the opinion that the combination has, or is likely to have an 
adverse effect on competition, it shall direct that the combination shall not take effect. 
 
(ii) Where the Commission is of the opinion that adverse effect which has been caused or is likely to be 
caused on competition can be eliminated by modifying such Combination then it shall direct the 
parties to such combination to carry out necessary modifications to the Combination. 
 
(iii) The parties accepting the proposed modification shall carry out such modification within the period 
specified by the Commission. 
 
(iv) Where the parties who have accepted the modification, fail to carry out such modification within the 
period specified by the Commission, such combination shall be deemed to have an appreciable 
adverse effect on competition and shall be dealt with by the Commission in accordance with the 
provisions of the Act. 
 
(v) If the parties to the Combination do not accept the proposed modification such parties may within thirty 
days of modification proposed by the Commission, submit amendment to the modification proposed 
by the Commission. 
 
(vi) If the Commission agrees with the agreement submitted by the parties it shall, by an order approve 
the combination. 
 (vii) If the Commission does not accept the amendment then, parties shall be allowed a further period of 
thirty days for accepting the amendment proposed by the Commission. 
 (viii) Where the parties to the combination fail to accept the modification within thirty days, then it shall be 
deemed that the combination has an appreciable adverse effect on Competition and will be dealt 
with in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  
 
(ix) Where the Commission directs under Section 31 (2) that the combination shall not take effect or it 
has, or is likely to have an appreciable adverse effect, it may order that, 
 
(a) the acquisition referred to in Section 5 (a); or  
 
(b) the acquiring of control referred to in Section 5(b); or 
 
(c) the merger or the amalgamation referred to in Section 5(c) shall not be given effect to by the 
parties. 
 
 As per proviso the Commission may, if it considers appropriate, frame a scheme to implement its 
order in regard to the above matters under Section 31(10).  
EP-EBCL 
272 
 
(x) A deeming provision has been introduced by Section 31(11). It provides that, if the Commission 
does not, on expiry of a period of two hundred ten days from the date of filing of notice under 
Section 6(2) pass an order or issue any direction in accordance with the provisions of Section 29(1) 
or Section 29(2) or Section 29(7), the combination shall be deemed to have been approved by the 
Commission. In reckoning the period of two hundred ten days, the period of thirty days specified in 
Section 29(6) and further period of thirty working days specified in Section 29(8) granted by 
Commission shall be excluded.  
 
(xi) Further more where extension of time is granted on the request of parties the period of two hundred 
ten days shall be reckoned after deducting extended time granted at the request of the parties. 
 (xii) Where the Commission has ordered that a combination is void, as it has an appreciable adverse 
effect on competition, the acquisition or acquiring of control or merger or amalgamation referred to 
in Section 5, shall be dealt with by other concerned authorities under any other law for the time 
being in force as if such acquisition or acquiring of control or merger or amalgamation had not taken 
place and the parties to the combination shall be dealt with accordingly. 
 (xiii) Section 29(14) makes it clear that nothing contained in Chapter IV of the Act shall affect any 
proceeding initiated or may be initiated under any other law for the time being in force. It implies that 
provisions of this Act are in addition to and not in derogation of provisions of other Acts. 
Thus, approval under one law does not make out a case for approval under another law. 
Acts taking place outside India but having an effect on Competition in India 
Section 32 extends the jurisdiction of Competition Commission of India to inquire and pass orders in 
accordance with the provisions of the Act into an agreement or dominant position or combination, which is 
likely to have, an appreciable adverse effect on competition in relevant market in India, notwithstanding that, 
 
(a) an agreement referred to in Section 3 has been entered into outside India; or 
 
(b) any party to such agreement is outside India; or 
 
(c) any enterprise abusing the dominant position is outside India; or 
 
(d) a combination has taken place outside India; or 
 
(e) any party to combination is outside India; or 
 
(f) any other matter or practice or action arising out of such agreement or dominant position or 
combination is outside India.  
The above clearly demonstrates that acts taking place outside India but having an effect on competition in 
India will be subject to the jurisdiction of Commission. The Competition Commission of India will have 
jurisdiction even if both the parties to an agreement are outside India but only if the agreement, dominant 
position or combination entered into by them has an appreciable adverse effect on competition in the 
relevant market of India.  
Appearance before Commission 
As per Section 35 of the Act, following persons are entitled to appear before the Commission 
 
(i) a complainant; or 
 
(ii) a defendant; or 
 
(iii) the Director General  
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002

1959) and who has obtained a certificate of practice; 
 
(d) a legal practitioner that is an advocate, vakil or an attorney of any High Court including a pleader in 
practice. 
 
 
The above provisions unambiguously state that a ‘Company Secretary in Practice’ is 
entitled to represent an informant or a defendant or Director General. A Company 
Secretary in Practice can also get himself empanelled with the Director General to 
prosecute his cases before the Commission. 
Power of Commission to regulate its own procedure 
The Competition Commission of India has been empowered to lay down its own procedure and regulations. 
It is not bound by the procedure laid down by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 but shall have to observe 
the principles of natural justice and subject to the provisions of the Act. The Competition Commission of India 
shall also be subject to the rules made by the Central Government. Section 36(2) makes it clear that the 
Commission shall have the same powers as are vested in a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 
1908 while trying the suit, in respect of the following matters, namely:

EP-EBCL 
274 
In terms of Section 36(4), the Commission may direct any person –  
 
(a) to produce before the Director General or the Secretary or an officer authorized by it, such books, or 
other documents in the custody or under the control of such person so directed as may be specified

be required for the purposes of the Act; 
 
(b) to furnish to the Director General or the Secretary or any other officer authorized by it, as respects 
the trade or such other information as may be in his possession in relation to the trade carried on by 
such person, as may be required for the purposes of the Act.

commerce, accountancy, international trade or from any other discipline as it deems necessary, to assist in 
the conduct of any inquiry or proceeding before it. 
As stated earlier, Director General is an important functionary assisting the Commission and the Commission 
may ask the Director General to investigate into any trade practice and for the purpose of examination of 
books, or account and other document of the parties concerned. The Director General is also vested with all 
the powers as are conferred upon the Commission under Section 36(2) of Act.

any mistake apparent from the record. Section 38(2) provides that subject to other provisions of this Act, the 
Commission may make – 
 
(a) an amendment of an order of its own motion; 
 
(b) an amendment for rectifying any mistake apparent from record, which has been brought to its notice 
by any party to the order. 
An explanation below the Section clarifies that while rectifying any mistake apparent from the record, the 
Commission shall not amend substantive part of the order passed by it under the provisions of this Act. 
Execution of Orders of the Commission Imposing Monetary penalty 
Section 39 provides that if a person fails to pay any monetary penalty imposed on him under the Act, the 
Commission shall proceed to recover such penalty, in such manner as may be specified by the regulations. 
In a case where the Commission is of the opinion that it would be expedient to recover the penalty imposed 
under the Act in accordance with the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961, it may make a reference to this 
effect to the concerned income-tax authority under that Act for recovery of the penalty as tax due under the 
said Act. 
Where a reference has been made by the Commission under sub-section (2) for recovery of penalty, the 
person upon whom the penalty has been imposed shall be deemed to be the assessee in default under the 
Income Tax Act, 1961 and the provisions contained in sections 221 to 227, 228A, 229, 231 and 232 of the 
said Act and the Second Schedule to that Act and any rules made there under shall, in so far as may be, 
apply as if the said provisions were the provisions of this Act and referred to sums by way of penalty imposed 
under this Act instead of to income-tax and sums imposed by way of penalty, fine, and interest under the 
Income–tax Act, 1961 and to the Commission instead of the Assessing Officer.

1961 (43 of 1961), in the said provisions of that Act or the rules made thereunder shall be construed as 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
275 
references to sections 43 to 45 of this Act. 
Explanation 2 – The Tax Recovery Commissioner and the Tax Recovery Officer referred to in the Income-tax 
Act, 1961 shall be deemed to be the Tax Recovery Commissioner and the Tax Recovery Officer for the 
purposes of recovery of sums imposed by way of penalty under this Act and reference made by the 
Commission under sub-section (2) would amount to drawing of a certificate by the Tax Recovery Officer as 
far as demand relating to penalty under this Act. 
Explanation 3– Any reference to appeal in Chapter XVIID and the Second Schedule to the Income-tax Act, 
1961 shall be construed as a reference to appeal before the Competition Appellate Tribunal under section 
53B of this Act. 
It would be noted that Commission may by its Regulations has been empowered to evolve procedure of 
recovering monetary penalty. It may also make reference to Income Tax Authority for recovering of penalty 
as tax due under the said Act. 
As per Section 39, every order passed by the Commission under this Act shall be executed in the same 
manner as if it were a decree or order made by the High Court or the Principal Civil Court in any suit pending 
therein.  
It shall be lawful for the Commission to send, in event of its inability to execute it such order to the High Court 
or to the Principal Civil Court, as the case may be, within the limits of whose jurisdiction—

Duties of Director General 
The Act provides that the Director General when so directed by the Commission, is to assist the Commission 
in investigation into any contravention of the provisions of this Act. The Director General is bound to comply 
with such a direction to render requisite assistance to the Commission. 
The Director General, in order to effectively discharge his functions, has been given the same powers as are 
conferred upon the Commission under section 36(2). Under section 36(2) the Commission is having same 
powers as are vested in Civil Court under the Code of Civil Procedure (1908) while trying a suit, in respect of

Without prejudice to the above powers, the provisions of Sections 240 and 240A of the Companies Act, 
1956, so far as may be, shall apply to an investigation made by the Director General or by a person 
authorised by him, as they apply to an inspector under the Companies Act 1956. This power includes search 
and seizure of the record of any person in respect of which an investigation has been directed by the 
Commission. It has been provided that wherever the approval of the Central Government is required, the 
same shall be given by the Commission and the word ‘magistrate’ appearing in Section 240A shall be 
construed as the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate.  
Penalties 
The Competition Act prescribes penalties for contravention of orders of the Commission. As per Section 42, 
the Commission may cause an inquiry to be made into compliance of its orders or directions and  
 
(a) if any person, without any reasonable cause, fails to comply with any order of the Commission, or

(b) if any person fails to pay the penalty imposed under the Act, 
he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine which may

Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi, however, shall not take cognizance of any offence save as a complaint 
filed by Commission or any of its officers authorized by it.  
Compensation in case of Contravention of Orders of commission 
Section 42A provides that without prejudice to the provisions of this Act, any person may make an

Penalty for making false statement 
Section 44 provides that If any person, being a party to a combination, makes a statement which is false in 
                                                                         Lesson 12         Competition Act, 2002 
277 
any material particular, or knowing it to be false; or omits to state any material particular knowing it to be 
material, such person shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than rupees fifty lakhs but which 
may extend to rupees one crore, as may be determined by the Commission. 
Power to impose lesser penalty 
If any producer, seller, distributor, trader or service provider included in any cartel, which is alleged to have 
violated Section 3, has made a full and true disclosure in respect of alleged violations and such a disclosure 
is vital, the Commission may impose upon him a lesser penalty than as prescribed under the Act or rules or 
regulations. 
However, the lesser penalty shall not be imposed where before making such disclosure, the report of 
Director General under Section 26 has been received in the Commission. Further, the lesser penalty shall be 
imposed only in respect of the producer, seller, distributor, trader or service provider included in the cartel, 
who has made a full, true and vital disclosures under this Section. Any producer, seller, trader or service 
provider included in the cartel shall also be liable to imposition of penalty, if in the course of proceedings, 
had, 
 
(a) not complied with the condition on which the lesser penalty was imposed by the Commission; or 
 
(b) given false evidence; or 
 
(c) the disclosure made is not vital. 
The lesser penalty is for a member of a ring who breaks the rank. There is no provision to provide any 
protection or incentive to a whistle blower, which is conferred upon Authorities in contemporary legislations 
abroad.  
The Act does not vest power in the Commission to compound an offence as was the position under the 
MRTP Act. It is viewed that long drawn investigation and enquiries could be arrested by provision such as 
compounding which allows an offence to be settled quickly. The Commission is also not vested with power to 
contempt. 
Contravention by Companies 
A company means a body corporate and includes a firm or other association of individuals; director, in 
relation to a firm, means a partner in the firm for the purposes of penalties in connection with contravention of 
the provisions of the Act by companies. 
Where any rule, regulation, order made by the Commission or any direction issued thereunder is 
contravened by a company, every person who, at the time the contravention was committed, was in charge, 
and was responsible to the company for conducting business of the company, as well as the company, shall 
be deemed to be guilty of the contravention and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished. 
However it will be a good defence by a person liable to any punishment if he proves that the contravention 
was committed without his knowledge or that he has exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of 
an offence. 
Where a contravention of any of the provisions of this Act or any rule, regulation, order made or direction issued 
thereunder has been committed by a company and it is proved that contravention has taken place with the 
consent or connivance of, or it is attributable to any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or 
other officer of the company, such director, manager, secretary or other officer shall also be deemed to be 
guilty of the contravention and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly. 
EP-EBCL 
278 
The word company in this Section, has been used in a wider sense and also includes a ‘firm’ or an ‘association 
of persons’. Though the word ‘director’ is normally used in a company, in the light of the wider definition, the 
term director is interpreted to include a partner of the firm. The company being a legal person, its affairs are 
conducted by a board of directors, manager, secretary or other officer, therefore, according to Section 48 (2) 
such director, manager, secretary or other officer, in addition to the company itself shall be deemed to be liable 
to be proceeded against for contravention of any provisions of this Act or any rule, regulation, order made or 
direction issued thereunder by the Commission or the Director General of Investigation. 
Competition Advocacy 
Under Section 49 the Central Government/State Government may seek the opinion of the CCI on the 
possible effects of the policy on competition or any other matter. In this context, Section 49 envisages that 
while formulating a policy on the competition, the Government may make a reference to the Commission for 
its opinion on possible effect of such a policy on the competition, or any other matter. 
On receipt of such a reference, the Commission shall, give its opinion on it to the Central Government/State 
Government, within sixty days of making such a reference and the latter may formulate the policy as it

binding upon the Central Government/State Government in formulating such a policy. The Commission is

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Every individual is a consumer, regardless of 
occupation, age, gender, community, cast, creed, 
religion or race. Consumer rights and welfare are an 
integral part of the life of an individual and we all 
have made use of them at some or the other point in 
our daily routine. Consumer is the real deciding 
factor for all economic activities. It is now universally 
accepted that the extent of consumer protection is a 
true indicator of the level of progress in a nation. 
Taking into account the interests and needs of 
consumers in all countries, particularly those in 
developing countries, recognizing that consumers 
often 
face 
imbalances 
in 
economic 
terms, 
educational level and bargaining power, and bearing 
in mind that consumer should have the right of 
access to non-hazardous products, as well as 
importance 
of 
promoting 
just, 
equitable 
and 
sustainable economic and social development, the 
Secretary General, United Nations submitted draft 
guidelines for consumer protection to the Economic 
and Social Council in 1983. Thereupon on an 
extensive discussions and negotiations among 
various countries on the scope and content of such 
impending legislation certain guidelines were arrived 
at.  
In line with the international development on 
consumer 
protection, 
the 
Parliament 
enacted 
Consumer Protection Act, 1986 provides a forum for 
speedy and simple redressal of consumer disputes. 
The rights under the consumer protection flow from 
the rights enshrined in Articles 14 to 19 of the 
Constitution of India.  
 
  
According to the preamble, the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 to provide for better protection of the interests of 
consumers and for that purpose to make provision for the establishment of consumer councils and other authorities for 
the settlement of consumer’s disputes and for matters connected therewith. 
LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL 
290 
INTRODUCTION 
A consumer is a user of goods and services, therefore, every producer is also a consumer. However, 
conflicting interests have categorised them, inevitably, into two different groups. The industrial revolution 
brought in the concept of standardisation and mass production and over the years, the type of goods and the 
nature of services available grew manifold. The doctrine of ‘Caveat Emptor’ or ‘let the buyer beware’ which 
came into existence in the middle ages had been replaced by the principle of ‘Consumer Sovereignty or 
‘Consumer is the King’. But, with tremendous increase in the world population, the growing markets were 
unable to meet the rising demand which created a gap between the general ‘demand’ and ‘supply’ levels in 
the markets. This to some extent watered down the concept of ‘Consumer Sovereignty’, what with 
consumers being forced to accept whatever was offered to them. On the other hand, the expanding markets 
necessitated the introduction of various intermediaries between the producer and the ultimate consumer. 
‘Advertising’, though ostensibly directed at informing potential consumers about the availability and uses of a 
product began to be resorted to as a medium for exaggerating the uses of ones products or disparaging 
others products so as to have an edge over competitors. Unfair and deceptive practices such as selling of 
defective or sub-standard goods, charging exhorbitant prices, misrepresenting the efficacy or usefulness of 
goods, negligence as to safety standards, etc. became rampant. It, therefore, became necessary to evolve 
statutory measures, even in developed countries, to make producers/traders more accountable to 
consumers. It also became inevitable for consumers to unite on a common platform to deal with issues of 
common concern and having their grievances redressed satisfactorily. 
Genesis of Consumer Protection Laws 
The need to ensure the basic rights to health, safety, etc. of consumers has long been recognised the world 
over and various general legislations were enacted in India and abroad in this direction. In India, the general 
enactments other than the law of torts which ultimately aimed at protection of consumers interests are the 
Indian Contract Act, 1872, the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930, the Agricultural 
Produce (Grading and Marketing) Act, 1937, the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, the Indian Standards 
Institution (Certification Marks) Act, 1952, the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954, the Drugs and 
Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954, the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, the 
Standards of Weights and Measures Act, 1976 (Now Legal Metrology Act, 2009), the Trade and 
Merchandise Marks Act, 1958, (Now Trade Marks Act, 1999), the Patents Act, 1970, the Hire Purchases Act, 
1972 and the Prevention of Black Marketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 
1980. 
These legislations contained regulatory provisions and contravention of these provisions attracted civil 
liability. This meant that an ordinary consumer had no other remedy but to initiate action by way of a civil suit 
which involved lengthy legal process proving to be too expensive and time consuming for lay consumers. In 
fact, at times, the time and cost involved in the legal process was disproportionate to the compensation 
claimed and granted to an individual consumer. Though the MRTP Commission proved to be far more 
accessible and less time-consuming than the Civil Courts, its single central location at New Delhi did not 
make the redressal agency accessible to all consumers, especially those located in the remote towns and 
villages of the country. Therefore, it became necessary to evolve laws directed at protecting the consumers 
and at the same time, providing for remedies which are simpler, more accessible, quicker and less 
expensive. 
This paved the way for enactment of the Consumer Protection Act in 1986 providing for simple, quick and 
easy remedy to consumers under a three-tier quasi-judicial redressal agency at the District, State and 
National levels. To make the Act more effective and meaningful, necessary changes have been brought by 
Consumer Protection (Amendment) Act, 2002, which came into force w.e.f. March 15, 2003. 
                                                                         Lesson 13         Consumer Protection Act, 1986 
291 
The Basic Rights of Consumers 
The basic rights of consumers that are sought to be promoted and protected are: 
• the right to be protected against marketing of goods and services which are hazardous to life and 
property; 
• the right to be informed about the quality, quantity, potency, purity, standard and price of goods, or 
services so as to protect the consumer against unfair trade practices; 
• the right to be assured, wherever possible, access to variety of goods and services at competitive 
prices; 
• the right to be heard and to be assured that consumers interests will receive due consideration at 
appropriate forums; 
• the right to seek redressal against unfair trade practices or restrictive trade practices or unscrupulous 
exploitation of consumers; and 
• right to consumer education. 
This is based on the basic rights of consumers as defined by the International Organisation of Consumers 
(IOCU) viz., the Rights to Safety, to Information, of Choice, to be Heard, to Redressal, to Consumer 
Education, to Healthy Environment and to Basic Needs. 
SCOPE OF THE ACT 
The Act extends to the whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir and applies to all goods and 
services unless otherwise notified by the Central Government. The Act received the Presidents assent on 
24.12.1986. However, all provisions of the Act except those relating to establishment, composition, 
jurisdiction, etc. of the Consumer Disputes Agencies (which came into force on 1.7.1987) came into force on 
15.4.1987. 
DEFINITIONS 
Section 2(1) of the Act defines various terms used in the Act. Some of the definitions are given hereunder: 
Complainant means 
 
(i) a consumer, or 
 
(ii) any voluntary consumer association registered under the Companies Act, 1956, or under any other 
law for the time being in force; or 
 
(iii) the Central Government or any State Government, who or which makes a complaint; or 
 
(iv) one or more consumers where there are numerous consumers having the same interest; 
 
(v) in case of death of a consumer, his legal heir or representative; who or which makes a complaint 
[Section 2(1)(b)]. 
An association of persons, to have locus standi as consumer, it is necessary that all the individual persons 
forming the association must be consumers under Section 2(1)(d) of the Act having purchased the same 
goods/hired the same service from the same party i.e. they should have a common cause of action. Thus, 
unlike MRTP Act, 1969, the Redressal Machinery under Consumer Protection Act, 1986 has no power to 
initiate cases suo-moto. 
EP-EBCL 
292 
Complaint means any allegation in writing made, with a view to obtaining any relief, by a complainant that 
 
(i) an unfair trade practice or a restrictive trade practice has been adopted by any trader or service 
provider; 
 
(ii) the goods bought by him or agreed to be bought by him suffer from one or more defects; 
 
(iii) the services hired or availed of or agreed to be hired or availed of by him suffer from deficiency in 
any respect; 
 
(iv) a trader or the service provider, as the case may be, has charged for the goods or for the services 
mentioned in the complaint, a price in excess of the price— 
 
— fixed by or under any law for the time being in force; 
 
— displayed on the goods or any package containing such goods; 
 
— displayed on the price list exhibited by him by or under any law for the time being in force 
 
— agreed between the parties. 
 
(v) goods which will be hazardous to life and safety when used are being offered for sale to the 
public,— 
 
— in contravention of any standards relating to safety of such goods as required to be complied 
with, by or under any law for the time being in force; 
 
— if the trader could have known with due diligence that the goods so offered are unsafe to the 
public. 
 
(vi) services which are hazardous or likely to be hazardous to life and safety of the public when used, 
are being offered by the service provider which such person could have known with due diligence to 
be injurious to life and safety. [Section 2(1)(c)]. 
Consumer means any person who 
 
(a) buys any goods for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly 
promised, or under any system of deferred payment and includes any user of such goods other than 
the person who buys such goods for consideration paid or promised or partly paid or partly 
promised, or under any system of deferred payment when such use is made with the approval of 
such person, but does not include a person who obtains such goods for resale or for any 
commercial purpose; or 
 
(b) hires or avails of any services for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid 
and partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment and includes any beneficiary of such 
services other than the person who hires or avails of the services for consideration paid or 
promised, or partly paid and partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment, when such 
services are availed of with the approval of the first mentioned person but does not include a person 
who avails of such services for any commercial purpose. [Section 2(1)(d)]. 
It has been clarified that the term commercial purpose does not include use by a consumer of goods bought 
and used by him exclusively for the purpose of earning his livelihood by means of self-employment. 
Therefore, to be a ‘consumer’ under the Act: 
 
(i) the goods or services must have been purchased or hired or availed of for consideration which has 
been paid in full or in part or under any system of deferred payment, i.e. in respect of hire purchase 
                                                                         Lesson 13         Consumer Protection Act, 1986 
293 
transactions; 
 
(ii) goods purchased should not be meant for re-sale or for a commercial purpose. Goods purchased 
by a dealer in the ordinary course of his business and those which are in the course of his business 
to supply would be deemed to be for  re-sale; and 
 
(iii) in addition to the purchaser(s) of goods, or hirer(s) or users of services, any beneficiary of such 
services, using the goods/services with the approval of the purchaser or hirer or user would also be 
deemed a ‘consumer under the Act. 
A purchase of goods can be said to be for a ‘commercial purpose only if the goods have been purchased for 
being used in some profit making activity on a large-scale, and there is close and direct nexus between the 
purchase of goods and the profit-making activity. In Laxmi Engineering Works v. P.S.G. Industrial Institute, 
Supreme Court held that the explanation to Section 2(1)(d) is clarificatory in nature. It observed that whether 
the purpose for which a person has bought goods is a ‘commercial purpose’ is always a question of facts and 
to be decided in the facts and circumstances of each case. If the commercial use is by the purchaser himself 
for the purpose of earning his livelihood by means of self employment such purchaser of goods would yet be 
a consumer. The Supreme Court further observed that if a person purchased a machine to operate it himself 
for earning his livelihood, he would be a consumer. If such person took the assistance of one or two persons 
to assist him in operating the machine, he would still be a consumer. But if a person purchases a machine 
and appoint or engage another person exclusively to operate the machine, then such person would not be a 
consumer. 
In Bhupendra Jang Bahadur Guna v. Regional Manager and Others (II 1995 CPJ 139), the National 
Commission held that a tractor purchased primarily to till the land of the purchaser and let out on hire during 
the idle time to till the lands of others would not amount to commercial use. 
The question as to whether the widow of the deceased policy holder was a ‘consumer’ under the Act was 
decided in the affirmative by the State Commission in Andhra Pradesh in the case of A Narasamma v. LIC of 
India. The State Commission held that as the term ‘consumer’ includes any beneficiary of service other than 
the person who hires the services for consideration, the widow being the beneficiary of services is a 
‘consumer’ under the Act entitled to be compensated for the loss suffered by her due to negligence of the 
LIC. 
In Laxmiben Laxmichand Shah v. Sakerben Kanji Chandan and others 2001 CTJ 401 (Supreme Court) (CP), 
the Supreme Court held that the tenant entering into lease agreement with the landlord cannot be 
consideredas consumer under Section 2(1)(d) of the Act. Where there was no provision in the lease 
agreement inrespect of cleaning, repairing and maintaining the building, the rent paid by tenant is not the 
consideration foravailing these services and therefore, no question of deficiency in service. 
Goods, in terms of Section 2(1)(i) has been defined to mean goods as defined in the Sale of Goods 
Act,1930. As per Section 2(7) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 Goods means every kind of movable property 
other than actionable claims and money; and includes stock and shares, growing crops, grass and things 
attached to or forming part of the land, which are agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract of 
sale. Therefore, most consumer products come under the purview of this definition. 
In Morgan Stanley Mutual Fund v. Kartik Das (1994) 3 CLJ 27, the Supreme Court held that an application 
for allotment of shares cannot constitute goods. It is after allotment, rights may arise as per the articles of 
association of the company. At the stage of application there is no purchase of goods for consideration and 
again the purchaser cannot be called the hirer of services for consideration. 
EP-EBCL 
294 
Service:  The term ‘service’ is defined under Section 2(1)(o) as to mean service of any description which is 
made available to potential users and includes, but not limited to the provision of facilities in connection with 
banking, financing, insurance, transport, processing, supply of electrical or other energy, board or lodging or 
both, housing construction, entertainment, amusement or the purveying of news or other information, but 
does not include the rendering of any service free of charge or under a contract of personal service. 
Passengers travelling by trains on payment of the stipulated fare charged for the ticket are ‘consumers’ and 
the facility of transportation by rail provided by the railway administration is a ‘service’ rendered for 
consideration as defined in the Act Subscribers of telephones would also be ‘consumer’ under the Act. 
Contract of Service and Contract for Service 
The Supreme Court in the case of Indian Merchants Association v. V P Shantha, (CA No. 688 of 1993 
decided on 13th November 1995) observed that a contract for service implies a contract whereby one party 
undertakes to render services e.g. professional or technical services to or for another in the performance of 
which he is not subject to detailed direction and control but exercises professional or technical skill and uses 
his own knowledge and discretion. A contract of service on the other hand implies relationship of master and 
servant and involves an obligation to obey orders in the work to be performed and as to its mode and 
manner of performance. The Parliamentary draftsman was well aware of this well-accepted distinction 
between ‘contract of service’ and ‘contract for services’ and had deliberately chosen the expression ‘contract 
of service’ instead of the expression ‘contract for service’ in the exclusionary part of the definition of ‘service’, 
this being the reason being that an employer could not be regarded as a consumer in respect of the services 
rendered by his employee in pursuance of contract of employment. By affixing the adjective ‘personal’ to the 
word ‘service’ the nature of the contracts which were excluded were not altered. The adjective only 
emphasised that what was sought to be excluded was personal service only. The expression contract of 
personal service in the exclusionary part of Section 2(1)(o) must, therefore, be construed as excluding the 
services rendered by an employee to his employer under the contract of personal service free from the ambit 
of the expression service. 
Service Rendered under Medicare Insurance Scheme:  Service rendered by a medical practitioner or 
hospital/nursing home can not be regarded as service rendered free of charge, if the person availing the 
service has taken an insurance policy for medical care whereunder the charges for consultation, diagnosis 
and medical treatment are borne by the insurance company and such service would fall within the ambit of 
‘service’ as defined in Section 2(1)(o). Similarly, where as a part of the conditions of service, the employer 
bears the expenses of medical treatment of an employee and his family members dependent on him, service 
rendered to such an employee and his family members would not be free of charge and would constitute 
‘service’ under Section 2(1)(o) of the Act. 
In State of Haryana v. Santra [2000(3) SCALE 417], the Supreme Court held that in a country where the 
population has been increasing rapidly and the Government has taken up the family planning as an 
important programme, the medical officer as also the State Government must be held responsible in 
damages if the family planning operation is a failure on account of the medical officers negligence because 
this has created additional burden on the parents of the child. 
In the case of Alex J. Rebello v. Vice Chancellor, Banglore University and others, 2003 CTJ 575 (CP) 
(NCDRC) the National Commission has held that the University in conducting examination, evaluating 
answer sheets and publishing the result was not performing any service for consideration and a candidate 
who appeared for the examination cannot be regared as a consumer. 
Consumer Dispute means a dispute where the person against whom a complaint has been made, denies or 
disputes the allegation contained in the complaint [Section 2(1)(e)]. 
                                                                         Lesson 13         Consumer Protection Act, 1986 
295 
Restrictive Trade Practice means a trade practice which tends to bring about manipulation of price or its 
conditions of delivery or to affect flow of supplies in the market relating to goods or services in such a 
manner as to impose on the consumers unjustified costs or restrictions and shall include— 
 
(a) delay beyond the period agreed to by a trader in supply of such goods or in providing the services 
which has led or is likely to lead to rise in the price; 
 
(b) any trade practice which requires a consumer to buy, hire or avail of any goods or, as the case may 
be, services as condition precedent to buying, hiring or availing of other goods or services.[Section 
2(1)(nn)]. 
Defect means any fault, imperfection or shortcoming in the quality, quantity, potency, purity or standard 
which is required to be maintained by or under any law for the time being in force or under any contract, 
express or implied, or as is claimed by the trader in any manner whatsoever in relation to any goods [Section 
2(1)(f)]. 
It is clear from the above definition that non-fulfilment of any of the standards or requirements laid down 
under any law for the time being in force or as claimed by the trader in relation to any goods fall under the 
ambit of defect. Therefore, contravention of any of the provisions of enactments such as the Drugs & 
Cosmetics Act, 1950, , the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1955, the Indian Standards Institution 
(Certification Marks) Act, 1952 etc. or any rules framed under any such enactment or contravention of the 
conditions or implied warranties under the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 in relation to any goods have also been 
treated as a defect under the Act. Fault, imperfection or shortcoming in quality, quantity, potency, purity or 
standard as claimed by the trader in any manner whatsoever in relation to goods is to be determined with 
reference to the warranties or guarantees expressly given by a trader. 
Deficiency means any fault, imperfection, shortcoming or inadequacy in the quality, nature and manner of 
performance which is required to be maintained by or under any law for the time being in force or has been 
undertaken to be performed by a person in pursuance of a contract or otherwise in relation to any service 
[Section 2(1)(g)]. 
Failure to maintain the quality of performance required by the law or failure to provide services as per 
warranties given, by the provider of the service would amount to ‘deficiency’. 
In Divisional Manager, LIC of India v. Bhavanam Srinivas Reddy, the National Commission observed that 
default or negligence in regard to settlement of an insurance claim (on allegation of suppression of material 
facts, in this particular case) would constitute a deficiency in service on the part of the insurance company 
and it will be perfectly open for the aggrieved consumer to approach the Redressal Forums to seek 
appropriate relief. 
In Jaipur Metals and Electrical Ltd. v. Laxmi Industries, the National Commission held that a reading of 
Section 2(1)(g) of the Act shows that deficiency must pertain to the ‘performance’ in terms of quality, nature 
and manner to be maintained or had been undertaken to be performed in pursuance of a contract. 
In Punjab National Bank v. K.B. Shetty (First Appeal No. 7 of 1991 decided on 6th August, 1991), ornaments 
kept in the banks locker were found lost though the certificate recorded by the custodian of the bank on the 
day the customer operated the locker stated that all lockers operated during the day have been checked and 
found properly locked. The National Commission upholding the decision of the State Commission, held the 
bank guilty of negligence and therefore, liable to make good the loss.  
However, failure to provide nursing and financing facilities to a small scale industry which consequently 
became sick cannot be said to constitute ‘deficiency in service’ as in matters of grant or withholding of further 
EP-EBCL 
296 
advances and insisting on margin money, banks may exercise their discretion and act in accordance with 
their best judgement after taking into account various relevant factors. Therefore, the proper forum to agitate 
such grievances is a civil court (Special Machines v. Punjab National Bank, Original Petition No. 32/1989 
decided on 22.12.1989; M.L. Joseph v. SBI: O.P. No. 2/1989 decided on 31.8.1989). It has also been held by 
National Commission in the case of Mrs. Anumati v. Punjab National Bank (2003 CTJ 921 (CP) (NCDRC) 
that the financial institutions have every right to protect their interests by taking conscious decisions. There 
shall be no deficiency in service where the bank takes conscious decision to adjust the fixed deposit of the 
joint holders against the loan taken by a third party when the FDR has been mortgaged as guarantee for 
loan. 
Failure of a Housing Board to give possession of the flat after receiving the price and after registering it in 
favour of the allottee was held to be ‘deficiency in service’ in the case of Lucknow Development Authority 
v.Roop Kishore Tandon F.N. No. 54/1990 decided on 10.10.1990. 
Cancellation of train services by the railways due to disturbance involving violence so as to safeguard the 
passengers as well as its own property was held by the National Commission as not constituting ‘deficiency 
in service’ on the part of the Railway. [Dainik Rail Yatri Sangh (Regd.) v. The General Manager, 
NorthernRailway - I (1992) CPJ 218 (NC)]. Failure of the Railways to provide cushioned seats in the first 
class compartments as per specifications laid down by the Railway Board and to check unauthorised 
persons from entering and occupying first class compartments was held to be ‘deficiency’ [N. Prabhakaran v. 
GeneralManager, Southern Railway, Madras - I (1992) CPJ 323 (NC). 
In Union Bank of India v. Seppo Rally OY (1999) 35 CLA 203, the Supreme Court held that delay in payment 
of an unconditionally guaranteed amount by a bank in India to a non-resident in Finland in foreign currency 
can not be attributed to any deficiency in the service of the bank when the banks stand is that the delay is 
caused by the failure of a bank in Finland, to which the remittance was to have been made under the 
nonresidents instructions to reply to the Indian Banks valid query in this connection and the RBI took time to 
grant the necessary permission to make the remittance. 
CONSUMER PROTECTION COUNCILS 
The interests of consumers are sought to be promoted and protected under the Act inter alia by

Protection Council (hereinafter referred to as the Central Council), consisting of the Minister in charge of 
Consumer Affairs in the Central Government, as its Chairman, and such number of other official or non 
official members representing such interests as may be prescribed. However, the Consumer Protection 
Rules, 1987 restrict the number of members of the Central Council to 150 members. Section 5 of the Act 
requires the Central Council to meet as and when necessary, but atleast once in every year. The procedure 
in regard to transaction of its business at the meeting is given in Rule 4 of the Rules.

establishment in every district of a council to be known as the District Consumer Protection Council .It shall 
consist of the Collector of the district (by whatever name called), who shall be its Chairman and such number 
of other official and non-official members representing such interests as may be prescribed by the State 
Government. The District Council shall meet as and when necessary but not less than two meetings shall be 
held every year. The District Council shall meet at such time and place within the district as the Chairman 
may think fit and shall observe such procedure in regard to the transaction of its business as may be

District Forum 
Section 9 of the Act provides for the establishment of a District Forum by the State Government in 
eachdistrict of the State. However, the State Government may establish more than one District Forum in a 
district if it deems fit to do so. Section 10(1) provides that each District Forum shall consist of: 
 
(a) Person who is, or who has been, or is qualified to be, a District Judge, who shall be its President; 
 
(b) Two other members one of whom shall be a woman, who shall have the following qualifications, 
namely: 
 
i) be not less than thirty-five years of age, 
 
ii) possess a bachelor’s degree from a recognised university, 
 
iii) be persons of ability, integrity and standing, and have adequate knowledge and experience of at 
least ten years in dealing with problems relating to economics, law, commerce, accountancy, 
industry, public affairs or administration: 
Provided that a person shall be disqualified for appointment as a member if he— 
 
(a) has been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for an offence, which, in the opinion of theState 
Government involves moral turpitude; or 
 
(b) is an undischarged insolvent; or 
 
(c) is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a competent court; or 
 
(d) has been removed or dismissed from the service of the Government or a body corporate owned or 
controlled by the Government; or 
 
(e) has, in the opinion of the State Government, such financial or other interest as is likely to affect 
prejudicially the discharge by him of his functions as a member; or 
 
(f) has such other disqualification as may be prescribed by the State Government. 
Every member of the District Forum shall hold office for a term of 5 years or upto the age of 65 years, 
whichever is earlier, and shall be eligible for reappointment for another term of five years or upto the age of 
sixty-five years, whichever is earlier, subject to the condition that he fulfills the qualifications and other 
conditions for appointment mentioned in Section 10(1)(b) and such re-appointment is also made on the basis 
of the recommendation of the Selection Committee. A member may resign his office in writing under his hand 
addressed to the State Government. 
Jurisdiction of District Forum 
Section 11 provides for the jurisdiction of the District Forum under two criteria pecuniary and territorial. 
Pecuniary limits 
Section 11(1) empowers the District Forum to entertain complaints where the value of goods or services and 
the compensation, if any, claimed does not exceed rupees twenty lakhs. 
Territorial limits 
Section 11(2) requires a complaint to be instituted in the District Forum within the local limits of whose 
jurisdiction the opposite party or the defendant actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or has 
a branch office or personally works for gain, at the time of institution of the complaint; or any one of the 
opposite parties (where there are more than one) actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or 
                                                                         Lesson 13         Consumer Protection Act, 1986 
299 
has a branch office or personally works for gain, at the time of institution of the complaint, provided that the 
other opposite party/parties acquiesce in such institution or the permission of the Forum is obtained in 
respect of such opposite parties; or the cause of action arises, wholly or in part. 
In the case of Dynavox Electronic Pvt. Ltd. v. B.J.S. Rampuria Jain College, Bikaner (Appeal No. 4/89 before 
the Rajasthan CDRC), it was held that where in a contract, the machinery was supplied and installed at a 
particular place, a part of cause of action would be deemed to have arisen at that place, therefore, the 
complaint could be instituted in the District Forum within whose jurisdiction that place falls.  
State Commission 
Section 16 of the Act empowers the State Government to establish the State Consumer Disputes Redressal 
Commission consisting of: 
 
(a)  a person who is or has been a judge of a High Court appointed by the State Government (in 
consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court) who shall be its President. 
 
(b) not less than two and not more than such number of members, as may be prescribed, one of whom 
shall be a woman, who shall have the following qualifications, namely: 
 
(i)  be not less than thirty-five years of age, 
 
(ii) possess a bachelor’s degree from a recognised university, and 
 
(iii) be persons of ability, integrity and standing, and have adequate knowledge and experience of at 
least ten years in dealing with problems relating to economics, law, commerce, accountancy,  
industry, public affairs or administration: 
It is required that not more than fifty per cent of the members be from amongst persons having a judicial 
background. “Persons having judicial background” shall mean persons having knowledge and experience for 
at least a period of ten years as a presiding officer at the district level court or any tribunal at equivalent level. 
A person shall be disqualified for appointment as a member if he 
 
(a) has been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for an offence, which, in the opinion of the State 
Government involves moral turpitude; or 
 
(b) is an undischarged insolvent; or 
 
(c) is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a competent court; or 
 
(d) has been removed or dismissed from the service of the Government or a body corporate owned or 
controlled by the Government; or 
 
(e) has in the opinion of the State Government, such financial or other interest, as is likely to affect 
prejudicially the discharge by him of his functions as a member; or 
 
(f) has such other disqualification as may be prescribed by the State Government. 
Every appointment shall be made by the State Government on the recommendation of a Selection 
Committee consisting of the President of the State Commission, Secretary Law Department of the State and 
Secretary in charge of Consumer Affairs in the State. The proviso to this clause states that where the 
President of the State Commission is, by reason of absence or otherwise, unable to act as Chairman of the 
Selection Committee, the State Government may refer the matter to the Chief Justice of the High Court for 
nominating a sitting Judge of that High Court to act as Chairman. Section 16(2) empowers the State 
EP-EBCL 
300 
Government to decide on the salary or honorarium and other allowances payable to the members of the 
State Commission and the other terms and conditions of service. 
Every member of the State Commission shall hold office for a term of five years or upto the age of sixty 
seven years, whichever is earlier and shall be eligible for reappointment for another term of five years or upto 
the age of sixty-seven years, whichever is earlier, subject to the condition that he fulfills the qualifications and 
other conditions for appointment mentioned in Section 16(1)(b) and such re-appointment is made on the 
basis of the recommendation of the Selection Committee. 
Jurisdiction of State Commission 
Section 17 of the Act provides for the jurisdiction of the Commission as follows: 
 
(a) the State Commission can entertain complaints where the value of the goods or services and the 
compensation, if any claimed exceed rupees twenty lakhs but does not exceed rupees one crore; 
 
(b) the State Commission also has the jurisdiction to entertain appeals against the orders of any District 
Forum within the State. However, under second proviso to Section 15 no appeal by a person, who 
is required to pay any amount in terms of an order of the District Forum, shall be entertained by the 
State Commission unless the appellant has deposited in the prescribed manner fifty percent of the 
amount or rupees twenty-five thousand, whichever is less; 
 
(c) the State Commission also has the power to call for the records and pass appropriate orders in any 
consumer dispute which is pending before or has been decided by any District Forum within the 
State, if it appears to it that such District Forum has exercised any power not vested in it by law or 
has failed to exercise a power rightfully vested in it by law or has acted illegally or with material 
irregularity. 
A complaint shall be instituted in a State Commission within the limits of whose jurisdiction, - 
 
(a) the opposite party or each of the opposite parties, where there are more than one, at the time of the 
institution of the complaint, actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or has a branch 
office or personally works for gain; or 
 
(b) any of the opposite parties, where there are more than one, at the time of the institution of the 
complaint, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business or has a branch office or 
personally works for gain, provided that in such case either the permission of the State Commission 
is given or the opposite parties who do not reside or carry on business or have a branch office or 
personally work for gain, as the case may be, acquiesce in such institution; or 
 
(c) the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises 
The State Commission’s jurisdiction may be original, appellate or revisional. In respect of (c)above, the State 
Commission may reverse the orders passed by the District Forum on anyquestion of fact or law or correct 
any error of fact or of law made by the Forum. 
The National Commission in Indian Airlines v. Consumer Education and Research Society (1992) CPR 
4(NC) held that in respect of the original jurisdiction of the State Commission, Section 17 only prescribes 
pecuniary limits. No territorial limits have been fixed for the exercise of original jurisdiction under the Act 
though the provision contained in Section 11(2) of the Act apply mutatis mutandis in the matter of 
entertaining original complaints by the State Commission. The territorial jurisdiction of the State Commission 
therefore extends to the territorial limit of the State. In the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, the State 
Commission may entertain appeals only against the orders of any District Forum within the State. Similar 
condition also applies in respect of the State Commissions power to revise orders of the District Forums -
                                                                         Lesson 13         Consumer Protection Act, 1986 
301 
only orders of the District Forum within the State may be subject to revision by the State Commission. 
Transfer of Cases 
Section 17A empowers the State Commission on the application of the complainant or of its own motion to 
transfer, at any stage of the proceeding any complaint pending before the District Forum to another District 
Forum within the State if the interest of justice so requires. 
National Commission 
Section 9 empowers the Central Government to establish the National Consumer Disputes Redressal 
Commission, by notification in the Official Gazette. Section 20(1) provides that the National Commission 
shall consist of— 
 
(a) a person who is or has been a judge of the Supreme Court, to be appointed by the Central 
Government (in consultation with the Chief Justice of India), who shall be its President; 
 
(b) not less than four and not more than such number of members as may be prescribed one of whom 
shall be a woman, who shall have the following qualifications, namely:- 
 
(i) be not less than thrity-five years of age; 
 
(ii)  possess a bachelor’s degree from a recognized university; and 
 
(iii) be persons of ability, integrity and standing and have adequate knowledge and experience of at 
least ten years in dealing with problems relating to economics, law, commerce, accountancy, 
industry, public affairs or administration: 
Provided that not more than fifty percent of the members shall be from amongst the persons having judicial 
background. “Persons having judicial background” shall mean persons having knowledge and experience for 
at least a period of ten years as a presiding officer at the district level court or any tribunal at equivalent level: 
A person shall be disqualified for appointment if he- 
 
(a) has been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for an offence, which, in the opinion of the 
Central Government involves moral turpitude; or 
 
(b) is an undischarged insolvent; or 
 
(c) is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a competent court; or 
 
(d) has been removed or dismissed from the service of the Government or a body corporate owned or 
controlled by the Government; or 
 
(e) has in the opinion of the Central Government such financial or other interest as is likely to affect 
prejudicially the discharge by him of his functions as a member; or 
 
(f) has such other disqualification as may be prescribed by the Central Government 
Every appointment by the Central Government is required to be made on the recommendation of a Selection 
Committee consisting of a Judge of the Supreme Court to be nominated by the Chief Justice of India, the 
Secretary in the Department of Legal Affairs and the Secretary in charge of Consumer Affairs in the 
Government of India. Section 20(2) empowers the Central Government to fix the salary/ honorarium and 
other allowances payable to the members as well as the other terms and conditions of their service. Every 
member of the National Commission shall hold office for a term of five years or upto seventy years of age, 
whichever is earlier and shall be eligible for reappointment for another term of five years or upto the age of 
seventy years, whichever is earlier, subject to the condition that he fulfills the qualifications and other 
EP-EBCL 
302 
conditions for appointment mentioned in Section 20(1)(b) and such re-appointment is made on the basis of 
the recommendation of the Selection Committee. 
Jurisdiction of National Commission 
Section 21 provides that the National Commission shall have jurisdiction: 
 
(a) to entertain complaints where the value of the goods or services and the compensation, if any, 
claimed exceeds rupees one crore; 
 
(b) to entertain appeals against the orders of any State Commission. However, under second proviso to 
Section 19 no appeal by a person, who is required to pay any amount in terms of an order of the 
State Commission, shall be entertained by the National Commission unless the appellant has 
deposited in the prescribed manner fifty percent of the amount or rupees thirty-five thousands, 
whichever is less; and 
 
(c) to call for the records and pass appropriate orders in any consumer dispute which is pending 
before, or has been decided by any State Commission where it appears to the National Commission 
that such State Commission has exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it by law, or has failed to 
exercise a jurisdiction so vested, or has acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with 
material irregularity. 
Complaints before the District Forum and State Commission 
Section 12 provides that a complaint, in relation to any goods sold or delivered or agreed to be sold or 
delivered or any service provided or agreed to be provided may be filed with the District Forum by— 
 
(a) the consumer to whom such goods are sold or delivered or agreed to be sold or delivered or such 
service provided or agreed to be provided; 
 
(b) any recognised consumer association, whether the consumer to whom the goods sold or delivered 
or agreed to be sold or delivered or service provided or agreed to be provided, is a member of such 
association or not; or 
 
(c) one or more consumers, where there are numerous consumers having the same interest with the 
permission of the District Forum, on behalf of, or for the benefit of, all consumers so interested; or 
 
(d) the Central or the State Government as the case may be, either in its individual capacity or as a 
representative of interests of the consumers in general. 
Every complaint filed under this section is required to be accompanied with such amount of fee and payable 
in such manner as may be prescribed. On receipt of a complaint, the District Forum may, by order, allow the 
complaint to be proceeded with or rejected. However, a complaint shall not be rejected unless an opportunity 
of being heard has been given to the complainant. It is also to be noted that the admissibility of the complaint 
shall ordinarily be decided within twenty-one days from the date on which the complaint was received. Where 
a complaint is allowed to be proceeded, the District Forum may proceed with the complaint in the manner 
provided under this Act. Where a complaint has been admitted by the District Forum, it shall not be 
transferred to any other court or tribunal or any authority set up by or under any other law for the time being 
in force. 
The explanation defines the term ‘recognised consumer association’ as to mean any voluntary consumer 
association registered under the Companies Act, 1956 or any other law for the time being in force. 
Thus, in case the affected consumer is unable to file the complaint due to ignorance, illiteracy or poverty, any 
                                                                         Lesson 13         Consumer Protection Act, 1986 
303 
recognised consumer association may file the complaint. The rule of ‘privity of contract' or locus standi which 
permits only the aggrieved party to take action has very rightly been set aside in the spirit of public interest 
litigation. Section 13 states the procedure to be followed by the District Forum or the State Commission on 
receipt of a complaint. On receipt of a complaint, a copy of the complaint is to be referred to the opposite 
party (or each of the opposite parties, where there are more than one) within twenty-one days from the date 
of its admission, directing him to give his version of the case within a period of 30 days. This period may be 
extended by another period of 15 days. If the opposite party admits the allegations contained in the 
complaint, the complaint will be decided on the basis of materials on the record. Where the opposite party 
denies or disputes the allegations contained in the complaint, or omits or fails to take any action to represent 
his case within the stipulated time, the dispute will be settled in the following manner: 
(i) In case of dispute relating to any goods 
Where the complaint alleges a defect in the goods which cannot be determined without proper analysis or 
test of the goods, a sample of the goods shall be obtained from the complainant, sealed and authenticated in 
the prescribed manner, for referring to the appropriate laboratory for the purpose of any analysis or test 
whichever may be necessary, so as to find out whether such goods suffer from any such defect. The 
‘appropriate laboratory’ would be required to report its finding to the referring authority, i.e. the District Forum 
or the State Commission within a period of forty-five days from the receipt of the reference or within such 
extended period as may be granted by these agencies [Section 13(1)(c)]. 
The term ‘Appropriate laboratory’ has been defined to mean a laboratory or organisation recognised by the 
Central Government or a State Government, subject to such guidelines as may be prescribed by the Central 
Government in this behalf; or any such laboratory or organisation established by or under any law for the 
time being in force, which is maintained, financed or aided by the Central Government or a State 
Government for carrying out analysis or test of any goods with a view to determining whether such goods 
suffer from any defect. 
Section 13 empowers the District Forum/State Commission to require the complainant to deposit such 
amount as may be specified, towards payment of fees to the ‘appropriate laboratory for the purpose of 
carrying out the necessary analysis or tests. The amount so deposited shall be remitted to the appropriate 
laboratory to enable it to carry out the analysis and send the report. On receipt of the report, a copy thereof is 
to be sent by District Forum/State Commission to the opposite party along with its own remarks. In case any 
of the parties i.e. opposite party or the complainant, disputes the correctness of the methods of analysis/test 
adopted by the appropriate laboratory, the concerned party will be required to submit his objections in writing 
in regard to the report. 
After giving both the parties a reasonable opportunity of being heard and to present their objections, if any, 
the District Forum/State Commission shall pass appropriate orders under Section 14 of the Act. 
(ii) In case of dispute relating to goods not requiring testing or analysis or relating to services Section 
13(2)(b) provides that where the opposite party denies or disputes the allegations contained in the complaint 
within the time given by the District/State Commission, the Agency concerned shall dispose of the complaint 
on the basis of evidence tendered by the parties. In case of failure by the opposite party to represent his 
case within the prescribed time, the complaint shall be disposed of on the basis of evidence tendered by the 
complainant. 
Limitation Period for Filing of Complaintl 
Section 24A provides that the District Forum, the State Commission, or the National Commission shall not 
admit a complaint unless it is filed within two years from the date on which the cause of action has arisen. 
EP-EBCL 
304 
However, where the complainant satisfies the Forum/Commission as the case may be, that he had sufficient 
cause for not filing the complaint within two years, such complaint may be entertained by it after recording 
the reasons for condoning the delay. 
Administrative Control 
Section 24B authorises the National Commission to exercise administrative control over the State 
Commissions in the matter of calling for periodical returns regarding the institution, pendency and disposal of 
cases, issuance of instructions regarding adopting of uniform procedure in hearing of matters, serving copies 
of documents, translation of judgements etc. and generally overseeing the functioning of the State 
Commission/District forum  to ensure that the objects and purposes of the Act are served in the best possible 
manner. 
Similarly, the State Commission has been authorised to exercise administrative control over all the District 
forum within its jurisdiction in all the above matters. 
Powers of the Redressal Agencies 
The District Forum, State Commission and the National Commission have been vested with the powers of a 
civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 while trying a suit in respect of the following matters: 
 
(i) the summoning and enforcing attendance of any defendant or witness and examining the witness 
on oath; 
 
(ii) the discovery and production of any document or other material object producible as evidence; 
 
(iii) the reception of evidence on affidavits; 
 
(iv) the requisitioning of the report of the concerned analysis or test from the appropriate laboratory or 
from any other relevant source; 
 
(v) issuing of any commission for the examination of any witness; and 
 
(vi) any other matter which may be prescribed. 
Under the Consumer Protection Rules, 1987, the District Forum, the State Commission and the National 
Commission have the power to require any person: 
 
(i) to produce before and allow to be examined by an officer of any of these agencies, such books of 
accounts, documents or commodities as may be required and to keep such book, documents etc. 
under his custody for the purposes of the Act; 
 
(ii) to furnish such information which may be required for the purposes of the Act to any officer so 
specified. 
These redressal agencies have also been empowered to pass written orders authorising any officer to 
exercise the power of entry and search of any premises where the books, papers, commodities or 
documents are kept if there is any ground to believe that these may be destroyed, mutilated, altered, falsified 
or secreted. Such authorised officer may also seize books, papers, documents or commodities if they are 
required for the purposes of the Act, provided the seizure is communicated to the District Forum/State 
Commission/National Commission within 72 hours. On examination of such documents or commodities, the 
agency concerned may order the retention thereof or may return it to the party concerned. 
The District forum, the State Commission and the National Commission have the power to issue remedial 
orders to the opposite party directing him to do any one or more of the things referred to in Section14(1)(a) to 
                                                                         Lesson 13         Consumer Protection Act, 1986 
305 
(i) as discussed herein below. The redressal agencies have also been empowered to dismiss frivolous and 
vexatious complaints under Section 26 of the Act and to order the complainant to make payment of costs, 
not exceeding `10,000 to the opposite party. 
 
COMPLAINTS TO BE REGISTERED 
District Consumer Forum 
for a claim of compensation up to `20 lakhs 
State Commission 
for a claim of compensation above `20 lakhs and 
up to `1 crore 
National Commission 
for a claim of compensation above Rs.1 crore 
Nature and Scope of Remedies under the Act 
In terms of Section 14(1) of the Act, where the goods complained against suffer from any of the 
defects specified in the complaint or any of the allegations contained in the complaint about the 
services are proved, the District Forum/State Commission/National Commission may pass one or 
more of the following orders: 
 
(a) to remove the defects pointed out by the appropriate laboratory from the goods in question; 
 
(b) to replace the goods with new goods of similar description which shall be free from any defect; 
 
(c) to return to the complainant the price, or, as the case may be, the charges paid by the complainant; 
 
(d) to pay such amount as may be awarded by it as compensation to the consumer for any loss or 
injury suffered by the consumer due to the negligence of the opposite party; 
 
(e) to remove the defects in goods or deficiencies in the services in question; 
 
(f) to discontinue the unfair trade practice or the restrictive trade practice or not to repeat them; 
 
(g) not to offer the hazardous goods for sale; 
    (h)   to withdraw the hazardous goods from being offered for sale; 
 (ha) to cease manufacture of hazardous goods and to desist from offering services which are hazardous 
in nature; 
 (hb) to pay such sum as may be determined by it if it is of the opinion that loss or injury has been 
suffered by a large number of consumers who are not identifiable conveniently: 
It is to be noted that the minimum amount of sum so payable shall not be less than five percent of the 
value of such defective goods sold or service provided, as the case may be, to such consumers. 
Further, the amount so obtained shall be credited in favour of such person and utilized in such manner 
as may be prescribed. 
 (hc) to issue corrective advertisement to neutralize the effect of misleading advertisement at the cost of 
the opposite party responsible for issuing such misleading advertisement; 
 
(i) to provide for adequate costs to parties. 
The remedies that can be granted by the redressal agencies are therefore, wide enough to cover removal of 
defects/deficiency in goods/services, replacing defective goods with new goods, refunding price/charges paid 
by the complainant, payment of compensation for loss or damage suffered, providing costs to parties and 
EP-EBCL 
306 
issuing prohibitory orders directing the discontinuance of unfair trade practice, sale of hazardous goods etc. 
However, the redressal agencies have not been granted power to order injunctions. Section 14(1)(d) 
provides that the redressal agency may order payment of compensation only in the event of negligence of 
the opposite party which resulted in loss or damage and not otherwise, i.e. even though the complainant has 
suffered loss or damage, he may not be entitled for compensation if he cannot prove negligence. 
Appeal 
Section 15 entitles a person aggrieved by an order of the District Forum to prefer an appeal to the State 
Commission. Similarly any person aggrieved by any original order of the State Commission may prefer an 
appeal to the National Commission under Section 19. Likewise, any person aggrieved by any original order 
of the National Commission may prefer an appeal to the Supreme Court, under Section 23. 
All such appeals are to be made within thirty days from the date of the order. However, the concerned 
Appellate authority may entertain an appeal after the said period of thirty days if it is satisfied that there was 
sufficient cause for not filling it within the prescribed period. The period of 30 days would be computed from 
the date of receipt of the order by the appellant. 
It may be noted that no appeal by a person, who is required to pay any amount in terms of an order of the 
District Forum/State Commission, shall be entertained by the State Commission/National Commission 
respectively unless the appellant has deposited in the prescribed manner fifty percent of that amount or 
twenty five thousand rupees/thirty-five thousand respectively, whichever is less. It may be observed that 
appeals are allowable only against the original orders passed by the concerned redressal agency. Appellate 
orders passed by the State Commission or National Commission (i.e. on appeal against the orders of the 
District Forum or State Commission) cannot be further appealed against though on questions of law revision 
petitions may be filed. So also, the revisional orders passed by the State Commission or the National 
Commission are not appealable. 
APPEAL 
Aggrieved by the orders issued by the District Consumer Redressal Forum, appeal petition may be filed 
before State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission within 30 days from the date of receipt of orders. 
Aggrieved by the orders issued by the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, appeal petition may 
be filed before National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission within 30 days from the date of receipt of 
orders. 
Aggrieved by the orders issued by the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, appeal petition 
may be filed before Supreme Court of India within 30 days from the date of receipt of orders 
Penalties 
Section 27 of the Act deals with penalties and provides that failure or omission by a trader or other person 
against whom a complaint is made or the complainant to comply with any order of the District Forum, State 
Commission or the National Commission shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be 
less than one month but which may extend to three years, or with fine of not less than Rs. 2,000 but which 
may extend to Rs. 10,000, or with both. 
However, on being satisfied that the circumstances of any case so require, the District Forum or the State 
Commission or the National Commission may impose a lesser fine or a shorter term of imprisonment. 
Section 27(3) prescribes that all offences under the Act to be tried summarily.

GIST OF IMPORTANT CONSUMER CASES 
Gist of some of the important rulings rendered by Supreme Court, National Commission and State 
Commissions, are given hereunder: 
Failure to provide basic safeguards in the swimming pool – deficiency in service 
In the case of Sashikant Krishnaji Dole v. Shitshan Prasarak Mandali [F.A. No. 134 of 1993 decided on 
27.9.1995 (NCDRC)] the school owned a swimming pool and offered swimming facilities to the public on 
payment of a fee. The school conducted winter and summer training camps to train boys in swimming and 
for this purpose engaged a trainer/coach. The complainants had enrolled their son for learning swimming 
under the guidance of the coach. It was alleged that due to the negligence of the coach the boy was drowned 
and met with his death. The school denied that it had engaged the services of a coach and also denied any 
responsibility on its part. The coach claimed that he was a person with considerable experience in coaching 
young boys in swimming and that as in other cases he taught the deceased boy also the way in which he 
should swim and take all precautions while swimming. When the deceased was found to have been drowned 
the coach immediately took him out of the water and removed the water from his stomach and gave him 
artificial respiration and thereafter took him to a doctor, where he died. 
The State Commission held the school and the coach deficient in rendering service to the deceased, that the 
coach was not fully trained, did not exercise even the basic commonsense needed to counter an accident in 
swimming. He was so casual in his behaviour that he did not attempt to take prompt action to save the life of 
the deceased and so far as the school was concerned it did not even provide basic facilities nor did it provide 
any safeguards to prevent accidents. 
Dismissing the appeal the National Commission observed that the State Commission had given cogent 
reasons for holding the school and the coach responsible for death of the deceased. A detailed examination 
of the depositions of eye witnesses showed that the Commission had correctly appreciated the evidence and 
come to the conclusion that the coach was negligent and the school did not provide the necessary life saving 
mechanism to save the lives of trainee students in cases of accidents. 
So far as the compensation was concerned the State Commission had taken all relevant factors into 
accountand fixed the amount at Rs. 1.50 lakhs which was reasonable. 
Removal of ladder of an aircraft while disembarking by the passenger— deficiency inservice 
In Station Manager, Indian Airlines v. Dr. Jiteswar Ahir [First Appeal No. 270 of 1994 decided on 28.2.1996 
(NCDRC)] when the complainant-passenger occupied his seat in the aircraft, an announcement was made 
that his luggage was lying on the ground unidentified and that he should disembark to identify his luggage. 
According to the complainant he moved towards the rear door, and finding that the step ladder was attached 
to the aircraft door, he stepped out on to the staircase but before he could actually put his entire body weight 
on the staircase the ladder was suddenly removed as a result of which he fell down on the ground and 
sustained bodily injuries which was reported to be about 10 percent. As against the complainant’s claim of 
`10 lakhs the airlines was willing to pay `40,000 as compensation which according to them was the 
maximum statutory liability of the Corporation under the Carriage by Air Act, 1972. 
The State Commission, after examining witnesses and the medical boards report held that there was 
dangerous deficiency in service and having regard to the expert opinion and other medical reports, it ordered 
payment of compensation of `4 lakhs and `1 lakh for mental agony and distress plus costs. 
In appeal by the Corporation, the National Commission, upholding the State Commissions order, held that in 
terms of regulations relied upon by the appellant Corporation, if it was proved that the accident caused to the 
EP-EBCL 
308 
complainant had resulted in a permanent disablement, incapacitating him from engaging in or being 
occupied with his usual duties or his business or occupation, the liability could not exceed Rs. 5 lakhs. This 
case related to the incapacity and permanent disability to the extent of 10 per cent and, therefore, the 
compensation could not exceed Rs. 5 lakhs. The State Commissions assessment of compensation of Rs. 4 
lakhs was justified, considering the age of the complainant (37 years) at the time of accident and his having 
lost earning capacity. The State Commission was also right in awarding compensation of rupees one lakh for 
the complainants mental suffering and agony as well as feeling of inferiority in social relations. Deficiency in 
service cannot be alleged without attributing fault, imperfection, shortcoming or in adequacy in the quality, 
nature and manner of performance which is required to be performed by a person in pursuance of a contract 
or otherwise in relation to any service. The burden of proving deficiency in service is upon the person who 
alleged it. When the complainant has not established any willful fault, imperfection, shortcoming or 
inadequacy in the service of the respondent, there can be no deficiency in service. 
In Ravneet Singh Bagga v. KLM Royal Dutch Fintimes [1999(7) SCALE 43], the complainant booked a ticked 
from Delhi to New York by a KLM plane. The airport authorities in New Delhi did not find any fault in his visa 
and other documents. However at Amsterdam, the airport authorities instituted proceedings of verification 
because of which the appellant missed his flight to New York. After reaching New York, the airlines tendered 
apology to the appellant for the inconvenience and paid as a goodwill gesture a sum of Rs. 2,500. The 
appellant made a complaint to the National Commission under the Consumer Protection Act which was 
rejected. 
The Supreme Court held that the respondent could not be held to be guilty of deficiency in service. The staff 
of the airline acted fairly and in a bona fide manner, keeping in mind security and safety of passengers and 
the Aircraft. The photograph on visa documents was a photo copy and not the original which was unusual. In 
the circumstances, the staff took some time to ascertain the truth and helped the appellant to reach New 
York the same day. 
A doctor qualified to practice homoeopathic system of medicines treating a patient with 
allopathic medicines and patient dies - guilty of negligence 
In Poonam Verma v. Ashwin Patel [1996(4) SCALE 364] the respondent was a qualified medical practitioner 
in homoeopathic system of medicine. The appellant, was the widow of a person who, it was alleged, had 
died because of the negligence of the respondent in administering allopathic medicines in which he was not 
qualified to practise. It was alleged that the deceased was treated to begin with, for viral fever on allopathic 
medicines and since his condition had not improved antibiotics were used without conducting proper tests. 
When his condition further deteriorated he was removed to a nursing home and after four days he was 
removed to a hospital in an unconscious state. Within a few hours thereafter he died. 
Her complaint to the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission for damages for the negligence 
and carelessness of respondent in treating her husband was dismissed. Allowing the appeal the Supreme 
Court held that the respondent who had practised in allopathy without being qualified in that system was 
guilty of negligence per se. A person is liable at law for the consequences of his negligence. Jurisdiction of 
the Commission: The Supreme Court observed that it is beyond doubt now that disputes regarding 
applicability of the Act to persons engaged in medical profession either as private practitioners or as 
Government doctors working in hospitals or Government dispensaries come within the purview of the 
Consumer Protection Act, 1986. It is also settled that a patient who is a consumer has to be awarded 
compensation for loss or injury suffered by him due to negligence of the doctor by applying the same tests as 
are applied in an action for damages for negligence. 
In Gopi Ram Goyal and others v. National Heart Institute and others, 2001 CTJ 405 (CP) (NCDRC), the 
                                                                         Lesson 13         Consumer Protection Act, 1986 
309 
National Commission held that where the record and evidence shows that the conduct of the opposite parties 
i.e. doctors was more than reasonable and the level of care was as could be expected from professional in 
exercising reasonable degree of skill and knowledge. The complainant however failed to prove any case of 
negligence on the part of doctors, therefore the doctor cannot be held liable for death of patient. 
Fall from a running train while passing through vestibule passage – deficiency in service 
In Union of India v. Nathmal Hansaria [First Appeal No. 692 of 1993 decided on 24.1.1997 (NCDRC)] the 
daughter of the respondent, travelling by a train, fell down from the running train while she was passing 
through the inter-connecting passage between two compartments and died as a result of crush injuries on 
her head. In the respondents petition for compensation, the Railways contended that the Consumer 
Redressal agencies had no jurisdiction to consider a complaint of this nature in view of Section 15 of the 
Railway Claims Tribunal Act read with Section 13 of that Act. 
The State Commission held that a railway passenger travelling in a train on payment of consideration was a 
consumer within the meaning of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Section 82A of the Railways Act 
referred to in Section 13 of the Railway Claims Tribunal Act, 1987 and the rules made thereunder provided 
compensation for railway accidents and not for accidental death of this nature. 
Dismissing the appeal the National Commission held that the death of the passenger could not be described 
as resulting from railway accident but an accidental death caused by the absence of safety devices in the 
vestibule passage way. 
Although the railway administration had claimed that the coach was a new coach and that all coaches had 
been thoroughly checked at the starting point of the train and that no defect was reported, the railways had 
not contended that this particular coach was checked at the time of commencement of the journey. The 
general statement of practice and procedure was not conclusive proof that this particular coach was checked 
and no evidence had been produced in support of their contention. Thus, the State Commission was right in 
holding that the deceased passenger was a consumer. On the basis of similar facts, the MRTP Commission 
has recently awarded a compensation of Rs. 18 lakhs with 9% interest to the parents of deceased. The 
above compensation appears to be the highest award in commission’s history. 
Repudiation of Insurance claim because the driver did not have a valid license 
In the case of Jitendra Kumar v. Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. and another the Supreme Court has held 
that where the fire has occurred due to mechanical failure and not due to any act or omission of the driver, 
the insurance company cannot repudiate the claim because of lack of valid driving license. 
Premium paid to the agent of the LIC but the agent did not deposit the premium, death of 
the insured - No deficiency of service on the part of the LIC 
In Harshad J. Shah v. Life Insurance Corporation of India [1997(3) SCALE 423 (SC)] the insured (since 
deceased) took out four life policies with double accident benefits, premium payable half-yearly. When the 
third premium fell due, the general agent of the Corporation met the person and took a bearer cheque 
towards the premium payable by him in respect of the policies. Although the cheque was encashed 
immediately thereafter, it was not deposited with the Corporation for another three months. In the meantime, 
the insured met with a fatal accident and died. The Corporation rejected the widows claim for payment of the 
sum assured on the ground that the policies had lapsed for non-payment of premium within the grace period. 
In the widows complaint to the State Commission under the Consumer Protection Act the Corporation 
pleaded that the amount of premium allegedly collected by the general agent could not be said to have been 
EP-EBCL 
310 
received by the Corporation, that the agent was not authorised to collect the premium amount. The State 
Commission held that in order to collect more business, agents of the Corporation collected premiums from 
policyholders either in cash or by cheque and then deposited the money so collected with the Corporation 
and that this practice had been going on directly within the knowledge of the Corporations administration, 
notwithstanding the departmental instructions that the agent was not authorised to collect the premiums. 
When the practice of the agent collecting the premiums from policyholders was in existence and the money 
was collected by the agent in his capacity and authority, the reasonable inference was that the Corporation 
was negligent in its service towards the policyholder. 
The National Commission, in appeal, was of the view that the insurance agent in receiving a bearer cheque 
from the insured towards payment of insurance premium was not acting as agent of the Corporation nor 
could it be said that the Corporation had received the premium on the date the bearer cheque was received 
by the agent, even though he deposited the sum with the Corporation a day after the death of the insured. 
Dismissing the appeal the Supreme Court held that the agent had no express authority to receive the 
premium on behalf of the Corporation. In his letter of appointment there was a condition expressly prohibiting 
him from collecting the premium. Nor could it be said that he had an implied authority to collect the premium, 
as regulation 8(4) expressly prohibited the agents from collecting premiums. Therefore, no case had been 
set up by the complainant before the State Commission that the Corporation by its conduct had induced the 
policyholders, including the insured, to believe that the agents were authorised to receive premiums on 
behalf of the Corporation. Nor was there any material on record that lent support to this contention. In the 
facts of this case there was no room to invoke the doctrine of apparent authority underlying Section 237 of 
the Indian Contract Act. 
In National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Seema Malhotra [2001(2) SCALE 140] (Supreme Court) a cheque was 
issued under a contract of insurance of motor car by the insured for payment of premium to the policy. 
However, cheque was dishonoured for want of funds in the account. Meanwhile, the car met with an accident 
and badly damaged, killing the insured owner. The claim for insured amount was repudiated by the company. 
The Supreme Court held that applying the principles envisaged under Section 51, 52 and 54 of Indian 
Contract Act, relating to reciprocal promises, insurer need not to perform his part of promise when the other 
party fails to perform his part and thus not liable to pay the insured amount. 
Educational Institutions 
In Sreedharan Nair N. v. Registrar, University of Kerala [2001 CTJ 561 (CP) (NCDRC)], the University 
refused to provide LL.B. degree certificate on completion of course on the ground that the qualifying 
examination on the basis of which student was admitted in LL.B. course in Kerala law college has not been 
recognised by it. The National Commission held that this is a clear case of deficiency on part of University. A 
compensation of Rs. 50,000 was awarded to complainant. 
In Isabella Thoburn College v. Ms. Fatima Effendi [2001 CTJ 386 (CP) (SCDRC)], the State Commission 
held that non-refund of admission fee is not a deficiency of service on the part of the university because 
admission fee is consideration for admission and respondent herself voluntarily withdrawing admission from 
one university to join another institute cannot claim refund of admission fee. 
Medical Negligence 
In Kusum Sharma & Others Versus Batra Hospital & Medical Research Centre & Others 2010 CTJ 242 
Supreme Court (CP) Supreme Court held that while deciding whether the medical professional is guilty of 
                                                                         Lesson 13         Consumer Protection Act, 1986 
311 
medical negligence following well known principles must be kept in view:- 
 
I. Negligence is the breach of a duty exercised by omission to do something which a reasonable man, 
guided by those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or 
doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do. 
 
II. Negligence is an essential ingredient of the offence. The negligence to be established by the 
prosecution must be culpable or gross and not the negligence merely based upon an error of 
judgment. 
 
III. The medical professional is expected to bring a reasonable degree of skill and knowledge and must 
exercise a reasonable degree of care. Neither the very highest nor a very low degree of care and 
competence judged in the light of the particular circumstances of each case is what the law 
requires. 
 
IV. A medical practitioner would be liable only where his conduct fell below that of the standards of a 
reasonably competent practitioner in his field. 
 
V. In the realm of diagnosis and treatment there is scope for genuine difference of opinion and one 
professional doctor is clearly not negligent merely because his conclusion differs from that of other 
professional doctor. 
 
VI. The medical professional is often called upon to adopt a procedure which involves higher element of 
risk, but which he honestly believes as providing greater chances of success for the patient rather 
than a procedure involving lesser risk but higher chances of failure. Just because a professional 
looking to the gravity of illness has taken higher element of risk to redeem the patient out of his/her 
suffering which did not yield the desired result may not amount to negligence. 
 VII. Negligence cannot be attributed to a doctor so long as he performs his duties with reasonable skill 
and competence. Merely because the doctor chooses one course of action in preference to the 
other one available, he would not be liable if the course of action chosen by him was acceptable to 
the medical profession. 
 VIII. It would not be conducive to the efficiency of the medical profession if no Doctor could administer 
medicine without a halter round his neck. 
 
IX. It is our bounden duty and obligation of the civil society to ensure that the medical professionals are 
not unnecessary harassed or humiliated so that they can perform their professional duties without 
fear and apprehension. 
 
X. The medical practitioners at times also have to be saved from such a class of complainants who 
use criminal process as a tool for pressurizing the medical professionals/hospitals particularly 
private hospitals or clinics for extracting uncalled for compensation. Such malicious proceedings 
deserve to be discarded against the medical practitioners. 
 
XI. The medical professionals are entitled to get protection so long as they perform their duties with 
reasonable skill and competence and in the interest of the patients. The interest and welfare of the 
patients have to be paramount for the medical professionals. 
The aforementioned principles must be kept in view while deciding the cases of medical negligence. We 
should not be understood to have held that doctors can never be prosecuted for medical negligence. As long 
as the doctors have performed their duties and exercised an ordinary degree of professional skill and 
competence, they cannot be held guilty of medical negligence. It is imperative that the doctors must be able 
to perform their professional duties with free mind.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
The Essential Commodities Act, 1955 was enacted 
to ensure easy availability of essential commodities 
to the consumers and to protect them from 
exploitation by unscrupulous traders. The Act 
provides for regulation and control of production, 
distribution and pricing of commodities, which are 
declared as essential for maintaining or increasing 
supplies or for securing their equitable distribution 
and availability at fair prices.  
The Essential Commodities Act is being implemented 
by the State Governments/UT Administrations by 
availing of the delegated powers under the Act. The 
State Governments/ UT Administrations have issued 
various Control Orders for regulation, production and 
distribution of Essential Commodities such as food 
grains, edible oils, pulses kerosene, sugar etc. The 
Central Government regularly monitors the action 
taken by State Governments/UT Administrations to 
implement 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
Essential 
Commodities Act, 1955.  
The items declared as essential commodities under 
the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 are reviewed 
from time to time in the light of liberalized economic 
policies 
in 
consultation 
with 
the 
Ministries/ 
Departments 
administering 
the 
essential 
commodities and particularly with regard to their 
production, demand, and supply. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
The preamble to the Act says that it is an Act to provide in the Interest of the general Public for the control of 
production, supply and distribution of, and trade and commerce in, certain commodities. 
LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL 
316 
INTRODUCTION 
In 1939 the Government of India made certain rules to control the production, supply and distribution of 
certain commodities under the Defence of India Act which ceased to have force in September, 1946. It was 
however considered necessary that control in respect of certain commodities essential for human beings 
should continue in the interest of the general public. Therefore, the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) 
Ordinance, XVIII of 1946 was promulgated by which certain provisions of the Defence of India Rules 
continued to have force. This Ordinance was subsequently replaced by the Essential Supplies (Temporary 
Powers) Act, 1946 (Act No. XXIV of 1946). 
The operation of the Act was prolonged upto 1st April, 1948, by virtue of a Notification published in the 
Gazette of India, dated March 8, 1947. Under certain resolution of the Constituent Assembly passed in 1948 
and 1949 and by the Adaptation of Laws Act, 1950, the operation of the Act was further extended to different 
periods from time to time. 
Since in public interest it was considered necessary that the Centre should continue to control production, 
supply and distribution of certain essential commodities, the need for a permanent measure on the subject 
was felt. For this purpose, certain amendments were required to be made in the Constitution. The 
Constitution (Third Amendment) Act made the required amendments in Entry 33 of List 3 of the Seventh 
Schedule to the Constitution to enable the Parliament to enact the required legislation. The Essential 
Commodities Ordinance No. 1 of 1955, was therefore, promulgated which came into force on 26th January, 
1955. This Ordinance was subsequently replaced by the present Act namely, the Essential Commodities Act, 
1955 (Act No. 1 of 1955) w.e.f 1st April, 1955. 
OBJECT AND SCOPE OF THE ACT 
The Preamble to the Act says that it is an Act to provide in the interest of the general 
public for the control of the production, supply and distribution of, and trade and 
commerce in, certain commodities. The dominant object and intendment of the Act is 
to secure equitable distribution and availability at fair prices of essential commodities 
in the interest of the general public. The interest of the general public necessarily connotes the 
interest of the consuming public and not the interest of the dealer (1958 Andh. LT587). 
DEFINITIONS (SECTION 2) 
The Act contains definitions of five important terms, namely: 
Collector 
“Collector” includes an Additional Collector, and such other officer not below the rank of Sub-Divisional 
Officer as may be authorised to perform the functions and exercise the powers of the Collector under the Act 
[Section 2(ia)]. 
Essential Commodities 
Section 2A dealing with Essential commodities declaration, etc. defines the "essential commodity" as to 
mean a commodity specified in the Schedule. 
 
                                                                         Lesson 14         Essential Commodities Act, 1955 317 
Schedule to the Act lists out following commodities: 
 
 
 
(1) drugs: The explanation clarifies that for the purposes of this Schedule, "drugs" has the meaning 
assigned to it in clause (b) of Section 3 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 (23 of 1940); 
 
(2) fertilizer, whether inorganic, organic or mixed; 
 
(3) foodstuffs, including edible oilseeds and oils; 
 
(4) hank yarn made wholly from cotton; 
 
(5) petroleum and petroleum products; 
 
(6) raw jute and jute textiles; 
 
(7)   (i) seeds of food-crops and seeds of fruits and vegetables; 
 
(ii) seeds of cattle fodder; and 
 
(iii) jute seeds. 
Sub-section (2) empowers the Central Government to amend, if it is satisfied that it is necessary so to do in 
the public interest and for reasons to be specified in the notification published in the Official Gazette, the 
Schedule so as to (a) add a commodity to the said Schedule; and (b) remove any commodity from the said 
Schedule, in consultation with the State Governments. 
In terms of Sub-section (3) any notification issued under Sub-section (2) may also direct that an entry shall 
be made against such commodity in the said Schedule declaring that such commodity shall be deemed to be 
an essential commodity for such period not exceeding six months to be specified in the notification. However, 
Central Government may, in the public interest and for reasons to be specified, by notification in the Official 
Gazette, extend such period beyond the said six months. 
The Central Government may exercise its powers under Sub-section (2) in respect of the commodity to 
which Parliament has power to make laws by virtue of Entry 33 in List III in the Seventh Schedule to the 
Constitution. Every notification issued under sub-section (2) is required to be laid, as soon as may be after it 
is issued, before both Houses of Parliament. 
In addition to the items included in the list given in the said clause, such other items which may be so 
declared by the Central Government by notified orders would also be included in the list of essential 
commodities, but in any case, such commodities would not be outside the scope of Entry 33 in List III in the 
Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. The Central Government has time and again, notified various 
commodities to be essential commodities. The term ‘essential commodities’ is defined in Rule 35(3) of the 
Defence of India Rules, 1962, to mean “food, water, fuel, light, power or any other thing notified by the 
Central Government in this behalf as essential for the existence of the community”. Of course, the definition 
in the Essential Commodities Act is more comprehensive than that in the Defence of India Rules, but both 
definitions enumerate certain things or articles and have scope for addition to the list of other articles notified 
in that behalf by the Central Government. As such, the articles not expressly mentioned in the definition 
given in the Defence of India Rules, can become essential commodities within the meaning of the expression 
used in the Rules by a simple government notification and the slight difference in the definition of essential 
commodity in the Act from that given in the Rules does not make one repugnant to the other [Nathuni Lai 
Gupta v. The State (1964 Cr. LJ 662)]. 
 
EP-EBCL 
318 
IN S. Samuel, MD. Harrisons Malayava v. Union of India, AIR 2004 SC 218, 
Supreme Court held that Tea is not foodstuff. Even in a wider sense, foodstuffs 
will not include tea as tea either in the form of the leaves or in the form of 
beverage, does not go into the preparation of food proper to make it more 
palatable and digestible. Tea leaves are not eaten. Tea is a beverage produced 
by steeping tea leaves or buds of the tea plants in the boiled water. Such tea is consumed hot or 
cold for its flavour, taste and its quality as a stimulant. The stimulating effect is caused by the 
presence of caffeine therein. Tea neither nourishes the body nor sustains nor promotes its growth. 
It does not have any nutritional value. It does not help formation of enzymes nor does it enable 
anabolism. Tea or its beverage does not go into the preparation of any foodstuff. In common 
parlance, any one who has taken tea would not say that he has taken or eaten food. Thus tea is not 
a food. 
Order: “Order” includes a direction issued thereunder [Section 2(c)]. 
State Government: “State Government”, in relation to a Union territory means the administrator of such 
territory [Section 2(d)]. 
Sugar: “Sugar” means: (i) any form of sugar containing more than 90 per cent of sucrose, including sugar 
candy; (ii) Khandsari sugar or bura sugar or crushedsugar, or any sugar in crystalline or powdered form; or 
(iii) sugar in process in vacuum pan sugar factory, or raw sugar [Section 2(e)]. 
Authorities responsible to administer the Act 
Necessary powers have been given to the Central Government under the Act to administer the provisions of 
the Act by issuing orders/directions notified in the official gazette and by delegating the authority to State 
Governments and administrators of Union Territories. The Central Government at its apex level is 
responsible for achieving the objectives enshrined by the Parliament under this Act for the welfare and 
general well-being of all the citizens. 
Powers of Central Government to control production, supply and distribution etc., of essential 
commodities [Section 3] 
 
Power to Issue Orders 
The Central Government having been vested with power under Section 3(1) can issue 
order in the following circumstances providing for regulating or prohibiting the 
production, supply and distribution of essential commodities and trade and commerce

(c) for controlling the price at which any essential commodity may be bought or sold.  
 
(d) for regulating by licences, permits or otherwise the storage, transport, distribution, disposal,

(e) for prohibiting the withholding from sale of any essential commodity ordinarily kept for sale;  
 
(f) for requiring any person holding in stock, or engaged in the production, or in the business of buying 
or selling, of any essential commodity—(a) to sell the whole or a specified part of the quantity held 
in stock or produced or received by him, or (b) in the case of any such commodity which is likely to 
be produced or received by him, to sell the whole or a specified part of such commodity when 
produced or received by him, to the Central Government or a State Government or to an officer or 
agent of such Government or to a Corporation owned or controlled by such Government or to such 
other person or class of persons and in such circumstances as may be specified in the order. 
 
 Explanation I provides that an order made under this clause in relation to foodgrains, edible oilseeds 
or edible oils may, having regard to the estimated production, In the concerned area, of such 
foodgrains, edible oilseeds and edible oils, fix the quantity to be sold by the producers in such area 
and may also fix, or provide for the fixation of such quantity on a graded basis, having regard to the 
aggregate of the area held by, or under the cultivation of the producers. 
 
 Explanation II provides that “production” for the purposes of this clause includes manufacture of 
edible oils and sugar with its grammatical variation and cognate expressions; 
 
(g) for regulating or prohibiting any class of commercial or financial transactions relating to foodstuffs 
which in the opinion of the authority making the order, are, or if unregulated, are likely to be

(j) for the grant or issue of licences, permits or other documents, the charging of fees therefor, the 
deposit of such sum, if any, as may be specified in the order as security for the due performance of 
the conditions of any such licence, permit or other document, the forfeiture of the sum so deposited 
or any part thereof for contravention of any such conditions and the adjudication of such forfeiture 
by such authority as may be specified in the order; 
 
(k) for any incidental and supplementary matters, including in particular, the entry, search or 
examination of premises, aircraft, vessels, vehicles or other conveyances and animals and the 
seizure by a person authorised to make such entry, search or examination of any article in respect 
of which such person has reason to believe that a contravention of the order has been, is being or is 
about to be, committed and any packages, coverings, or receptacles in which such articles are 
EP-EBCL 
320 
found; (ii) of any aircraft, vessel, vehicle or other conveyance or animal used in carrying such 
articles, if such a person has reason to believe that such aircraft, vessel, vehicle or other 
conveyance or animal is liable to be forfeited under the provisions of this Act; (iii) of any books of 
account and documents which in the opinion of such person, may be useful to, or relevant to any 
proceeding under this Act and the person from whose custody such books of account or documents 
are seized shall be entitled to make copies thereof or to take extracts therefrom in the presence of 
an officer having the custody of such books of account or documents. 
Fixing the Price of Essential Commodities being sold to Government 
Section 3(3) vests powers in Central Government to deal with the pricing of the essential commodities 
particularly when the commodities are being sold to Central/State Government in compliance of order under 
clause (f) of Sub-section (2) of Section 3. In such a case, the price shall be paid as provided hereunder: 
 
(a) the agreed price, where the price can be agreed upon consistently with the controlled price fixed 
under this section; 
 
(b) controlled price: where no such agreement can be reached, the price calculated with reference to 
controlled price; 
 
(c) the price calculated at the market rate prevailing in the locality on the date of sale, where neither 
clause (a) nor clause (b) applies. 
Fixing the Price of Essential commodities during Emergency 
Section 3(3A)(i) is in the nature of an emergency provision and can be resorted to meet a situation arising at 
a particular locality. It empowers the Central Government to direct the price at which the foodstuffs in any 
locality will be sold to general public. This direction will be issued only when the Central Government is of the 
opinion that takings such step is necessary for controlling price rise or preventing the hoarding of any 
foodstuff in any locality. The notification issued by the Government to the above effect shall be in force for 3 
months only as may be specified therein as per Sub-section (3A)(ii). Further, for selling specified foodstuffs 
in the specified locality, the seller shall be paid price therefor as follows: 
 
(a)  agreed price, when the price can be agreed upon consistently with the controlled price fixed under 
this sub-section; or 
 
(b) the controlled price, when no such agreement can be reached at as stated above; or 
 
(c) the market rate price as per the prevailing market rate in the locality at the date of sale where 
neither of the above clause (a) or (b) apply. 
Payment of Procurement Price for Foodgrains and Edible Oil 
The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 1976, inserted Sub-section (3B) in substitution of the then 
existing section providing for payment of procurement price of such foodgrains, edible oils or oilseeds as 
may be specified by State Government with the prior approval of Central Government. Therefore, as per 
Section 3(3B) where any person is required in terms of an order under Sub-section (2)(f) to sell to the Central 
Government or a State Government or any officer or agent of such Government or to a Corporation owned or 
controlled by such Government any grade or variety of foodgrains, edible oil and oilseeds in relation to which 
no notification has been issued Under Section 3(3A) or such notification, having been issued, has ceased to 
be in force, procurement price shall be paid irrespective of the provisions of Sub-section (3) having regard to 
the following facts: 
 
(a) the controlled price, if any, fixed under this section or by or under any other law for the time being in 
                                                                         Lesson 14         Essential Commodities Act, 1955 321 
force for such grade or variety of foodgrains, edible oils and oilseeds; 
 
(b) the general crop prospects; 
 
(c) the need for making such grade or variety of foodgrains, edible oils and seeds available at 
reasonable prices to the consumers, particularly the vulnerable sections of the consumers; and 
 
(d) the recommendations, if any, of the Agricultural Prices Commission with regard to the price of the 
concerned grade or variety of foodgrains, edible oils and oilseeds. 
Fixing Price for Sugar to be Paid to Producer 
Sub-section (3C) of Section 3 provides that where any producer of sugar is required by an order made under 
Sub-section (2)(f) to sell any kind of sugar to the Central or State Government/officer or agent of such 
government or to any person/class of persons, whether notification in this regard under Sub-section (3A) is 
issued or not or ceased to be in force and notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-section (3), the 
producer shall be paid such price for sugar as the Central Government may, by order, determine having 
regard to (a) the minimum price, if any fixed for sugar cane by the Central Government under this section; (b) 
the manufacturing cost of sugar; (c) the duty or tax, if any, paid or payable thereon; and (d) the securing of a 
reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar. 
Further, the Central Government may determine different prices for different areas from time to time or for 
different factories or for different kinds of sugar. It is explained in the sub-section that producers for the 
purposes of this sub-section shall include persons carrying on business of manufacturing sugar. 
Price fixation under Section 3(2) and 3(3B) is different from price fixation in the case of sugar under Sub-
section (3C). In the former, the dominant purpose in fixing price is to ensure that goods are available to 
consumers at a reasonable price. In the latter, price fixed must also give a reasonable return on investment 
to the producer. 
Sub-section (3D) of the Act empowers the Central Government to direct that no producer, importer or exporter 
to sell or otherwise dispose of or deliver any kind of sugar or remove any kind of sugar from the bonded 
godowns of the factory in which it is produced, whether such godowns are situated within the premises of the 
factory or outside or from the warehouses of the importers or exporters, as the case may be, except under and 
in accordance with its direction. However, this provision does not affect the pledging of such sugar by any 
producer or importer in favour of any scheduled bank as defined in clause (e) of Section 2 of the Reserve Bank 
of India Act, 1934 or any corresponding new bank constituted under section 3 of the Banking Companies 
(Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970, so, however, that no such bank sells the sugar pledged to 
it except under and in accordance with a direction issued by the Central Government. 
In terms of Sub-section 3(E) the Central Government has been empowered to direct from time to time, by 
general or special order, any producer or importer or exporter or recognised dealer or any class of producers 
or recognised dealers, to take action regarding production, maintenance of stocks, storage, sale, grading, 
packing, marking, weighment, disposal, delivery and distribution of any kind of sugar in the manner specified 
in the direction. 
Power to Appoint Authorised Controller 
The Central Government has been vested with necessary powers under Sub-section (4) of Section 3 to 
authorise any person (known as authorised controller) when it is considered necessary for maintaining or 
increasing the production and supply of essential commodities. The authorised controller shall exercise such 
functions of control as may be provided in the order with respect to the whole or any part of any such 
EP-EBCL 
322 
undertaking engaged in the production and supply of the commodity. The authorised controller shall exercise 
his functions in accordance with any instructions given to him by the Central Government. He shall not have 
any power to give any direction inconsistent with the provisions of any enactment or any instrument 
determining the functions of the person in charge of the management of the undertaking except in so far as 
may be specifically provided by the order. The undertaking shall be carried on in accordance with any 
directions, given by the authorised controller under the provisions of the order. The person who is 
responsible to function as a manager of the undertaking or part of it shall comply with such directions. 
Issuance and Service of Order 
An order made under Section 3 of the Act shall be issued and served in the manner as provided under 
Section 3(5) i.e. in the following manner: 
 
(a) in the case of an order of general nature or affecting a class of persons be notified in the official 
gazette; and 
 
(b) in the case of an order directed to a specified individual be served on such individual (i) by 
delivering or tendering it to that individual, or (ii) if it cannot be so delivered or tendered, by affixing it 
on the outer door or some other conspicuous part of the premises in which that individual lives, and 
a written report thereof shall be prepared and witnessed by two persons living in the neighbourhood.  
Laying the Order before Parliament 
Sub-section (6) provides that every order made under Section 3 by the Central Government or by any officer 
or authority of Central Government shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament as soon as may be, after it 
is made. 
Imposition of Duties on State Government 
Section 4 of the Act provides that an order made under Section 3 may confer powers and impose duties 
upon the Central Government or the State Government or officers and authorities of the Central Government 
or State Government and may contain directions to any, State Government or to officers or authorities 
thereof as to the exercise of any such powers or discharge of any such duties. 
Delegation of powers 
In terms of Section 5, the Central Government may, by notified order direct that the power to make orders or 
issue notifications under Section 3 shall in relation to such matters and subject to such conditions, if any, as 
may be specified in the direction be exercisable also by (a) such officer or authority subordinate to Central 
Government, (b) such State Government or such officer or authority subordinate to a State Government as 
may be specified in the direction. 
NATURE OF ORDER PASSED UNDER THE ACT 
It may be noted from the foregoing paragraphs that the order notified by the Government under Section 3(2) 
specifies the various aspects which may be covered under the order while ensuring the production, 
procurement and distribution of the essential commodities. Further, Sub-sections (3), (3A), (3B), (3C) provide 
for issuance of order for fixation of prices of the essential commodities. Order may be passed for appointing 
Controlling Authority under this Act which is of different nature being administrative in kind and effect. Sub-
section (5) provides for the issuance and service of the order. The order notified by the Government is such 
an important document that the Act provides, under Sub-section (6) of Section 3, for it to placed before both 
Houses of Parliament. Thus, the order in its nature, is a medium of administering the Act and a proper 
                                                                         Lesson 14         Essential Commodities Act, 1955 323 
course of communication to and from the Government, exercising and delegating the powers vested in the 
Government under the Act. 
Effect of the Order 
Section 6 provides that the order made under Section 3 shall have effect notwithstanding anything 
inconsistent therewith contained in any enactment other than this Act or any instrument having effect by 
virtue of any enactment other than this Act. 
It could be seen that this section does not either expressly or by implication, repeal any of the provisions of 
the pre-existing laws, nor does it abrogate such laws. The object of Section 6 is simply to by-pass them. 
Thus, for example, an order made under Section 3 would be operative in regard to the essential commodities 
covered by the Textile Control Order, wherever there is any repugnancy in that order with any existing law 
and to that extent the existing law with regard to those commodities will not operate. 
The Calcutta High Court had observed that the ultimate effect of Section 6 is that an order under Section 3 
will override existing laws, only on the ground that these are orders validly made under Section 3 of the Act 
(Ramananda Agrawala v. State AIR 1951 Calcutta 120). 
As rightly pointed out by the Patna High Court, Section 6 is a saving section which affords protection to the 
orders made under Section 3 of the Act as against the onslaught of any law, merely by reason of 
inconsistency (Mohammad Anwar Hussi v. State of Bihar, AIR 1955 Patna 220). 
Presumption as to Orders 
Section 13 provides that where an order purports to have been made and sign by an authority in exercise of 
any powers conferred by or under this Act, a court so presume that such order was so made by that authority 
within the meaning of Indian Evidence Act, 1972.  
Burden of Proof in certain cases 
Section 14 provides that on being prosecuted for contravention of any order made under Section 3 which 
prohibits him from doing any act or being in possession of a thing without lawful authority or without a permit, 
licence or other document such person shall have to prove that he has such authority, permit, licence or 
other document as the burden of proof lies upon him. 
Protection for Acts done in Pursuance of Order 
Section 15 provides immunity against action taken in good faith under the Act and lays down that no suit, 
prosecution or other legal proceedings can be taken against any person for anything which is in good faith 
done, or intended to be done, in pursuance of any order made under Section 3 of the Act. Likewise, no suit 
or other legal proceedings can lie against the Government, for any damage caused or likely to be caused, by 
any thing which is in good faith done, or intended to be done, in pursuance of any order made under Section 
3 of the Act. 
It may be noted that immunity can be claimed by the Government or by its officers, only if it is shown that an 
order was issued under Section 3 of the Act, and the liability which the plaintiff is seeking to enforce arises 
from the fact that action was taken in pursuance of the order of the government under that section. 
CONFISCATION OF ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES 
Seizure and Confiscation of Essential Commodities 
The Essential Commodities Act envisages two independent proceedings against a person charged with 
EP-EBCL 
324 
contravention of the provisions of the Act. Under Section 6A, the Collector can confiscate the seized 
commodity and under Section 7, the contravention would be punishable. Confiscation of essential 
commodities is a sharp weapon which the Act has provided to the Central Government under Section 6A of 
the Act. 
Section 6A provides that where any essential commodity is seized in pursuance of an order made under 
Section 3, a report of such seizure shall be made, without any unreasonable delay, to the Collector of the 
district or the Presidency town in which such essential commodity is seized. The Collector at his discretion, 
may direct for the production of the seized commodity before him and if he is satisfied that there has been 
contravention of the order he may pass order for confiscation of (a) the essential commodity so seized, (b) 
any package, covering or receptacle in which such essential commodity is found, and (c) any animal, vehicle, 
vessel or other conveyance used in carrying such essential commodity. Provided that without prejudice to 
any action which may be taken under any other provision of this Act, no foodgrains or edible oilseeds seized 
in pursuance of an order made under Section 3 in relation thereto from a producer shall, if the seized 
foodgrains or edible oilseeds have been produced by him, be confiscated under this section. Provided further 
that in the case of any animal, vehicle, vessel or other conveyance the owner of such animal, vehicle etc., 
shall be given an option to pay in lieu of its confiscation, a fine not exceeding the market price at the date of 
seizure of the essential commodity sought to be carried by such animal, vehicle, vessel, or other 
conveyance. 
The Act uses the expressions ‘confiscation’ and ‘seizure’ in Section 6A and under this section a commodity 
which has been seized in pursuance of an order under Section 3 can be confiscated under the 
circumstances mentioned in Section 6A. Therefore, it is essential to-know in brief the distinction between 
seizure and confiscation.  
‘Seizure’ 
 
 
The expression ‘seize’ means to take possession contrary to the wishes of the owner of the 
property and that such action is unilateral action of the person seizing. The person from whom 
anything is seized loses, from the moment of seizure, the right or power to control or regulate the 
use of that thing. The dictionary meaning of the word ‘seize’ means to lay hold of suddenly or 
forcible, to take hold of, to reach and grasp, to clutch’. It also means ‘to take possession of or 
appropriate in order to subject to the force or operation of a warrant, order of Court or other legal 
processes. A reference to some provisions of the Codes of Criminal Procedure shows that the term 
seizure had been used therein in connection with the taking of actual physical possession of 
moveable property. 
 
‘Confiscation’ 
 
 
‘Confiscation’ according to Wharton’s Law Lexicon, is condemnation and adjudication of property 
to the public treasury as of goods seized under the Customs Act. Confiscation, according to 
Strouds judicial Dictionary, must be an act done in some way on the part of the Government of the 
                                                                         Lesson 14         Essential Commodities Act, 1955 325 
country where it takes place and in some way beneficial to that Government, though the proceeds 
may not strictly speaking be brought into its treasury. In State of Kerala v. Mathai (1961 K.L.T. 169) 
it was pointed out that confiscation is not to be considered part of the sentence for an offence but 
is only a mode by which Courts can dispose of property which comes before it in criminal trials. 
That being the general distinction between confiscation and seizure, in the context of the Essential 
Commodities Act, it could be seen that an essential commodity which has been seized, could be confiscated. 
Therefore, confiscation is an action posterior to the seizure of the essential commodity. A commodity that 
has not been seized cannot be confiscated. Seizure itself does not imply confiscation. The seizure should 
have been made by virtue of an order passed under Section 3 of the Act. Clause (j) of Section 3 empowers 
the Government to make an order for seizure of any essential commodity if an order made by the Central 
Government controlling production, supply, distribution etc. of essential commodities has been or is about to 
be contravened. Therefore, any contravention or intended contravention of an order passed by the 
Government under the Act may lead to seizure, and under the circumstances mentioned in Section 6A such 
seized commodity could be confiscated. 
Power is conferred on the Collector to confiscate any animal, vehicle, vessel or other conveyance if used in 
carrying the essential commodities. Where it was clear from the report of the Sub-Inspector of Police that the 
jeep in question was not found or used for carrying any essential commodity, it was found moving in front of 
the lorry which was loaded with paddy, it was held that, that by itself was no ground for its seizure. Unless 
the vehicle was used for carrying the essential commodities, the Deputy Commissioner had no jurisdiction to 
initiate proceedings for its confiscation, much less the police to seize it. [Ramchandra v. Sub-Inspector of 
Police (1976) 1 Kar. LJ. 126] 
The Collector has no jurisdiction to go into the validity of the seizure; he could only confiscate goods, out of 
those seized, in respect of which contravention is established. Only if the seizure is valid could the Collector 
have jurisdiction to go on into the question whether there has been any contravention of the control order in 
respect of the whole or part of the goods, seized at this is entirely different from saying that the Collector 
could go on with the enquiry, postulated in Sections 6A and 6B, when the seizure itself, on which alone his 
jurisdiction to make an enquiry depends, is found to be illegal. [Hindustan Aluminium v. Controller of 
Aluminium, AIR (1976) DeWii225] 
In S. Seetharamayya Gupta v. Distt. Revenue Officer, Chittoor (AIR 1977 AP 103) it was held that delegation 
of power of the Collector under Section 6A to Distt. Officer is competent and valid. Even though Section 6A 
authorizes confiscation of seized goods it does not say that the entire seized quantity should be directed to 
be confiscated. It is left to the discretion of the Distt. Revenue Officer land the appellate authority to decide 
whether the entire seized stock should be confiscated or only a portion of it. That, however, is a judicial 
discretion and must be exercised judicially having regard to the circumstances of the case, the gravity of the 
matter and other relevant and pertinent factors. The Act provides for enquiry and total absence of adequate 
opportunity to the party to make representation and consequently passing order of confiscation must be held 
bad.  
Sale of the Confiscated Commodity 
Ssection 6A(2) provides that where the Collector, on receiving a report of seizure or on inspection of any 
essential commodity under Sub-section (1) above, is of the opinion that the essential commodity is subject to 
speedy and natural decay or it is otherwise expedient in the public interest so to do he may (i) order the 
same to be sold at the controlled price, if any, fixed for such essential commodity under this Act or under any 
other law for the time being in force; (ii) where no such price is fixed, order the same to be sold by public 
auction. Provided that in case of foodgrains, the collector may, for its equitable distribution and availability at 
EP-EBCL 
326 
fair prices, order the same to be sold through fair price shops at the price fixed by the Central Government or 
by the State Government as the case may be, for the retail sale of such foodgrains to the public. 
Disposal of Sale Proceeds of Confiscated Goods 
In terms of Section 6A(3), the sale proceeds of the essential commodity sold, after deduction of the 
expenses of any such sale or auction or other incidental expenses relating thereto shall be paid to the owner 
or person from whom it is seized in the following circumstances: (a) where no order of confiscation is 
ultimately passed by the Collector; (b) where an order passed on appeal under Sub-section (1) of Section 6C 
so requires, or (c) where in a prosecution instituted for the contravention of the order in respect of which an 
order of confiscation has been made under this section, the person concerned is acquitted. 
Issue of Show Cause Notice before Confiscation of Essential Commodity 
Before passing an order for confiscation under Section 6A, in terms of Sub-section (1) of Section 6B of the 
Act, the owner of the essential commodity, package, covering, receptacle, animal, vehicle, vessel or other 
conveyance or the person from whom it is seized is required to be given a notice in writing informing him of 
the grounds on which it is proposed to confiscate the above goods to provide him an opportunity of making a 
representation in writing within a reasonable time and give him a reasonable opportunity of being heard in 
the matter. 
It is also provided in Sub-section (2) that no order of confiscation can be made if the owner of the confiscated 
animal, vehicle, vessel or other conveyance proves to the satisfaction of the Collector that the said modes of 
transport owned by him were used in carrying the essential commodity without his knowledge or connivance 
of himself or his agent, if any, and each of them had taken the necessary precautions against such use. 
It is not sufficient for the owner to prove that the vehicle carried the essential commodity without his 
knowledge or concurrence. He must also prove that the vehicle was used without the knowledge, or 
concurrence of the person in charge of the vehicle. In addition, he must prove that not only he but also the 
person incharge of the vehicle had taken all reasonable and necessary precautions against such use [Shai 
Rahhim v. State of Andhra (1976) LT 357]. 
However, once an order confiscating the goods of above description has been passed it shall not be held 
invalid in terms of Sub-section (3) merely by reason of any defect or irregularity in the notice given under 
clause (a) of Sub-section (1) if in giving such notice the provisions of that clause have been substantially 
complied with. 
Appeal against Confiscation Order 
In terms of Sub-section (1) of Section 6C, any person aggrieved by an order of confiscation under Section 6A 
may appeal to the State Government concerned within one month from the date of passing the order. The 
State Government shall give an opportunity to the appellant to be heard and pass such order as it may think 
fit, confirming, modifying or annulling the order appealed against. In terms of Sub-section (2) of Section 6C, if 
the appeal has been decided in favour of appellant, he is entitled to the possession of the confiscated goods 
and if it is not possible for any reason to return the essential commodity seized from him, such person shall 
be paid the price therefor as if the essential commodity had been sold to the Government with reasonable 
interest calculated from the day of seizure of essential commodity and such price shall be determined in 
accordance with: (i) Sub-section (3B) of Section 3 in case of foodgrains, edible oils and oilseeds; (ii) Sub-
section (3C) of Section 3 in case of sugar; and (iii) Sub-section (3) of Section 3 in case of any other essential 
commodity. 
                                                                         Lesson 14         Essential Commodities Act, 1955 327 
Confiscation and punishment 
Section 6D provides that the award of any confiscation under this Act by the Collector shall not prevent the 
infliction of any punishment to which the person affected thereby is liable under this Act. 
Bar of Jurisdiction in Matters of Confiscation 
The 1976 Amendment Act has inserted Section 6-E in the Act which provides that no court, tribunal or 
authority shall have any jurisdiction to make an order with regard to the matters falling within the purview 
of this Act particularly wherever any essential commodity is seized in pursuance of an order made under 
Section 3 when the Collector or the judicial authority appointed under Section 6C shall have the 
jurisdiction. 
OFFENCES AND PENALTIES 
Cognizance of offences 
Section 10A of the Act declares that notwithstanding anything contained in the Criminal Procedure Code, 
1971, every offence punishable under the Act shall be cognizable. 
A cognizable offence is one, where, under the Criminal Procedure Code or any other law in force, a police 
officer may arrest a person without a warrant.  
Section 11 lays down that before a Court can take cognizance of any offence punishable under the Act, the 
following three conditions must be satisfied, viz. (i) there must be a report in writing, (ii) the report must be 
made by a public servant, as defined in Section 21 of Indian Penal Code, or any aggrieved person or any 
recognised consumer association. 
Prosecution of Public Servants (Section 15A) 
If any public servant is accused of any offence alleged to have been committed by him while acting, or 
purporting to act, in the discharge of his duties, in pursuance of any order made under Section 3, no court 
can take cognizance of such an offence except with the previous sanction—(a) of the Central Government in 
the case of a person who is employed in connection with the affairs of the Union; and (b) of the State 
Government in the case of a person who is employed in connection with the affairs of the State. 
Penalties 
Section 7 of the Act deals with penalties. Contravention of an order passed by the Central Government under 
Section 3 with reference to clause (h) or (i) of Sub-section (2) thereof is punishable with imprisonment for a 
term which may extend to one year and also with fine [Section 7(1)(a)(i)]. For the contravention of an order 
with reference to other clauses of Sub-section (2) of Section 3 the punishment is imprisonment for a term 
ranging from three months to seven years and in addition fine is also leviable. 
Further if any person contravenes any order made under Section 3, any property in respect of which the 
order has been contravened shall be forfeited to the Government and any package, covering, receptacle in 
which the property is found and any animal, vehicle, vessel or other conveyance used in carrying the 
property, could also be forfeited if the court so orders. 
If any person to whom a direction is given under Section 3(4) (b) fails to comply with it, he shall be 
punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three months but which may extend to 
seven years and shall also be liable to fine. 
If any person convicted of an offence under Section 7(1)(a)(ii) or 7(2) is again convicted of an offence under 
EP-EBCL 
328 
the same provision he shall be punishable with imprisonment for the second and for every subsequent 
offence for a term which shall not be less than six months but which may extend to seven years besides fine. 
For adequate and sufficient reasons the court can award imprisonment for a term less than six months. 
Where an offence is committed for a second time, besides the above punishment, the Court can also order 
that the person shall not carry on any business of that essential commodity for such period not being less 
than six months as may be specified by the Court. 
 
Mens rea (Sections 6A and 7) 
In Nathulal v. State of Madhya Pradesh (AIR 1966 S.C. 43) it was held by the Supreme 
Court that mens rea or guilty mind is an ingredient of the offence punishable under 
Section 7 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 i.e., an intentional contravention of 
an order made under Section 3, is an essential ingredient of an offence under Section 7. In other words, if 
the dealer did believe bona fide that he could store the foodgrains for instance, without infringing any order 
under Section 3, there could be no contravention under Section 7. 
It was observed by the Supreme Court in this case that mens rea is an essential ingredient of any criminal 
offence. Mens rea by necessary implication may be excluded from a statute only where it is absolutely 
clear that the implementation of the object of the Statute would otherwise be defeated. The nature of mens 
rea that would be implied in a Statute creating an offence depends on the object of the Act and the 
provisions thereof. 
In Hariprasad Rao v. State (AIR 1951 SC 264), it was observed that unless a Statute either clearly or by 
necessary implication rules out mens rea as a constituent part of a crime, an accused cannot be found 
guilty of an offence against the criminal law unless he has got a guilty mind. Therefore, mens rea is an 
essential ingredient of an offence under Section 7 of the Act. 
It is to be noted that the contravention under Section 6A is also of the same character. Section 6A in brief 
provides for seizure and confiscation based on ‘contravention’ of an order under Section 3. Therefore, the 
Collector before exercising his powers under the section would be entitled to take into consideration the 
question whether there was an intentional contravention of the order or whether the conduct of the dealer 
was bona fide under the belief that he was acting legally. But it should be remembered that the orders of the 
Collector are provisional in the sense that the Court is entitled, on appeal by the dealer, to look into whole 
matter to see whether there were reasons to confiscate the goods under Section 6A. It can be concluded that 
the provisions as regard ‘contravention’ under Section 6A or 7 are in pari materia—the contravention which 
details confiscation is of the same kind as that for which a dealer can be punished. 
An interesting question is whether the doctrine of mens rea applies to cases of vicarious liability, as for 
instance, in the case of a master and servant It is well accepted that the legislature cannot introduce the 
principles of vicarious liability and make the master liable for the act of his servants, although the master 
himself had no mens rea. Thus, in one case the charge against the respondents was that they sold some 
cloth in excess of the controlled price, and thus contravened the provisions of the Madhya Bharat Cotton 
Control Order; one of the respondents, Gangaram Saboo was not present in the shop at the time the cloth 
was alleged to have been sold, and it was, therefore, held that he could not be held vicariously liable for the 
act of his munim who had actually sold the cloth (State v. Gangaram AIR 1935 H.B. 244). 
  
                                                                         Lesson 14         Essential Commodities Act, 1955 329 
Culpable Mental State  
Section 10-C provides for a presumption of culpable mental state, which 
includes intention, motive, knowledge of a fact and the belief in a fact. It is now 
provided that in any prosecution for an offence under the Act which requires a 
culpable mental state on the part of the accused, the Court shall presume the 
existence of mental state. Of course, it is open to the accused to prove that he 
had no such mental state with respect of the act committed by him. 
Attempt and Abetment 
Section 8 provides that any person who attempts to contravene or abets a contravention of any order made 
under Section 3 shall be deemed to have contravened that order. 
False Statement 
A person shall be punishable under Section 9 with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years or 
with fine or with both for the following offences: 
 
(i) when required by any order made under Section 3 to make any statement or furnish any information, 
makes any statement or furnishes any information which is false in any material particular which he 
knows or has reasonable cause to believe to be false or does not believe to be true, or 
 
(ii) makes any such statement as aforesaid in any book, account, record, declaration, return or other 
document which he is required by any such order to maintain or furnish. 
Offences by Companies 
Section 10(1) provides that if the person contravening an order under Section 3 is, a company, every person 
who, at the time of the contravention, was in charge of, and was responsible to, the company for the conduct 
of the business of the company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the contravention, and shall be liable to be 
punished accordingly. In such cases, the company itself is also liable to be proceeded against. Any such 
person, can, however, escape liability if he proves that the contravention took place without his knowledge or 
that he exercised all due diligence to prevent it. 
It may be noted that the term ‘company’ as used above, refers to any body corporate, and even includes a firm 
or other association or individuals. In the case of a firm, the term ‘Director’ would mean a partner in the firm. 
Publication of names of convicted companies by Court 
Section 10-B of the Act provides that the Court may cause to be published in newspapers or in other manner 
at the expense of the company the name, place of business and the offence/contravention committed by it 
when a company has been convicted. However, no publication shall be made until the period for preferring 
an appeal against the order of the Court has expired, without any appeal having been preferred or where 
such appeal having been preferred, was disposed of. The expenses of any publication shall be recoverable 
from the company as if it were a fine imposed by Court. 
GRANT OF INJUNCTION BY CIVIL COURTS (SECTION 12B) 
It is expressly provided by Section 12B that no Civil Court can grant any injunction or make any order for any 
other relief against the Central or State Government or any public officer, in respect of any act done, or 
purporting to be done, by such person in his official capacity under the Act, or any Order made thereunder, until 
after notice of the application for such injunction or other report is given to the Government or to such officer.

LESSON ROUND-UP 
• 
Essential Commodities Act, 1955 has been enacted to provide in the interest of the general public for the control of 
the production, supply and distribution of and trade and commerce in, certain commodities. 
• 
Section 2A dealing with Essential commodities declaration, etc. defines the "essential commodity” as to means a 
commodity specified in the Schedule to the Act. 
• 
Central Government has been empowered to administer the provisions of the Act by issuing orders/directions 
notified in the official gazette and by delegating the authority to State Governments and administrators of Union 
Territories.  
• 
An essential commodity which has been seized could be confiscated. Therefore, confiscation is an action posterior 
to the seizure of the essential commodity. A commodity that has not been seized cannot be confiscated. Seizure 
itself does not imply confiscation. 
• 
Mens rea or guilty mind is an essential ingredient of the offence punishable under the Act.  
• 
Culpable mental state, which includes intention, motive, knowledge of a fact and the belief in a fact. 
• 
Where an offence is committed by a company, if it is proved that the offence had been committed with the consent 
or connivance of or is attributable to any neglect on the part of any Director, Manager, Secretary or other officer of 
the company, such a person shall be deemed to be guilty of that offence, and is liable to be proceeded against and 
punished accordingly. 
• 
The Act expressly provides that no Civil Court can grant any injunction or make any order for any other relief against 
the Central or State Government or any public officer, in respect of any act done, or purporting to be done, by such 
person in his official capacity under the Act, or any Order made thereunder, until after notice of the application for 
such injunction or other report is given to the Government or to such officer.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
“Weights and measures may be ranked among the 
necessaries of life to every individual of human 
society. They enter into the economical arrangements 
and daily concerns of every family", said Mr. John 
Quincy Adams, the Sixth US President in his report to 
Congress in 1821.  
The essence of these words show the importance of 
weights and measures. In fact, the influence and impact 
of the system of weights and measures for trade use is 
as pervasive as ever. Weights and measures embrace 
every aspect of modern living. It is therefore critical for 
any country to have an accurate system of weights and 
measures. Such a system is indispensable in facilitating 
trade – as it fosters certainty, trust and confidence in all 
transactions involving weights and measures. It 
underpins fair trade and competition and promotes 
efficiency, and in so doing, helps economy to grow. 
Metrology studies many types of measurements. It 
studies not only length but also such measurements as 
weight and time. Each and every one of these elements 
can be studied in various manners as well. In 
metrology, there are set standards that are set for 
measurement qualities to determine what the typical 
measurement is. In many cases, they also have a well 
thought out plan as to how much of a degree of error 
there is as well in each measurement. There are 
various answers to questions about metrology because, 
in many cases, each theory can be right. Metrology 
goes back thousands of years to early civilization and 
was present well before the aspects of science as well.  
The branch of knowledge concerning weights and 
measures is technically known as legal metrology. In 
basic 
form, 
metrology 
is 
the 
science 
of 
measurement. 
 
  
Legal metrology Act, 2009 intend to establish and enforce standards of weights and measures, regulate trade and 
commerce in weights, measures and other goods which are sold or distributed by weight, measure or number and 
for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL 
332 
INTRODUCTION 
Legal Metrology is the name by which the law relating to weights and measures is known in international 
parlance. Legal Metrology is very vital for scientific, technological and industrial progress of any country. The 
establishment of national standards of weights and measures and their proper enforcement aim at ensuring 
accuracy of measurements and measuring instruments and thus legal metrology strengthens the national 
economy in a broader sense besides being a potential instrument of consumer protection. The scope of legal 
metrology according to international practice extends to three broad fields of human activities, namely, 
commercial transactions, industrial measurements and measurements needed to ensure public health and 
human safety. The coverage of legal metrology varies from country to country. In some, almost all practical 
measurements are brought under the purview of legal metrology, whereas in other countries legal metrology 
finds restricted application in a few quantities like mass, length and volume used in trade and commerce. In 
most of the countries, however, legal metrology encompasses measurements which have a bearing on the 
protection of individuals from the financial and environmental points of view. 
Legal metrology can be defined as that part of metrology which deals with units of measurement, methods of 
measurement and measuring instruments in so far as they concern statutory, technical and legal 
requirements which have the ultimate object of assuring public guarantee from the point of view of security 
and of appropriate accuracy of measurements. 
International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML) 
The International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML) is an intergovernmental treaty organization whose 
membership includes Member States, countries which participate actively in technical activities, and 
Corresponding Members, countries which join the OIML as observers. It was established in 1955 in order to 
promote the global harmonization of legal metrology procedures. Since that time, the OIML has developed a 
worldwide technical structure that provides its Members with metrological guidelines for the elaboration of 
national and regional requirements concerning the manufacture and use of measuring instruments for legal 
metrology applications. 
According to OIML legal Metrology is the entirety of the legislative, administrative and technical procedures 
established by, or by reference to public authorities, and implemented on their behalf in order to specify and 
to ensure, in a regulatory or contractual manner, the appropriate quality and credibility of measurements 
related to official controls, trade, health, safety and the environment. 
The OIML develops model regulations, International Recommendations, which provide Members with an 
internationally agreed-upon basis for the establishment of national legislation on various categories of 
measuring instruments. Given the increasing national implementation of OIML guidelines, more and more 
manufacturers are referring to OIML International Recommendations to ensure that their products meet 
international specifications for metrological performance and testing.  
OIML Certificate System for Measuring Instruments 
The OIML Certificate System for Measuring Instruments was introduced in 1991 to facilitate administrative 
procedures and lower the costs associated with the international trade of measuring instruments subject to 
legal requirements. The System provides the possibility for a manufacturer to obtain an OIML Certificate and 
a Test Report indicating that a given instrument type (pattern) complies with the requirements of the relevant 
OIML International Recommendations. Certificates are delivered by OIML Member States that have 
established one or several Issuing Authorities responsible for processing applications by manufacturers 
wishing to have their instrument types (patterns) certified. 
                                                                         Lesson 15        Legal Metrology Act, 2009 333 
Certificates issued by OIML are accepted by national metrology services on a voluntary basis, and as the 
climate for mutual confidence and recognition of test results develops between OIML Members, the System 
serves to simplify the type (pattern) approval process for manufacturers and metrology authorities by 
eliminating costly duplication of application and test procedures.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Article 17 of Universal Declaration on Human Rights 
provides that everyone has the right to own property 
alone as well as in association with others and no 
one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property. As 
per Article 300A of Constitution of India, persons not 
to be deprived of property save by authority of law. 
Property has, always, been on the fundamental 
elements of socio economic life of an individual. 
Transfer of Property means an act by which a living 
person conveys property in present, or in future, to 
one or more other living persons, or to himself and 
one or more other living persons and "to transfer 
property" is to perform such an act. Consequently, 
the law relating to transfer of property is not only an 
important branch of civil law but also one that 
demands proper elucidation due to its complexity.  
Therefore, students should be well versed in this 
subject so as to understand the intricacies involved in 
the transfer of property. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
The law relating to transfer of property is governed by the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. The very preamble to the Act 
suggests that it simply defines and amends certain parts of the law relating to transfer of property by act of parties.

covered by certain Regulations and Acts, the Courts in India in the absence of any statutory provisions, 
applied rules of English law as the rule of justice, equity and good conscience. 
The Act was enacted with the object to amend the law relating to the transfer of property by act of parties. 
The Act excludes from its purview the transfers by operation of law, i.e. by sale in execution, forfeiture, 
insolvency or intestate succession. The scope of the Act is limited, as it is confined to transfers inter vivos 
and excludes testamentary succession, i.e. transfers by will. 
The very preamble to the Act suggests that it simply defines and amends certain parts of the law relating to 
transfer of property by act of parties, and it does not at all profess to be an exhaustive enactment as is 
revealed by the omission of the word “consolidate”. Therefore, the Act leaves the scope for applying rules of 
justice, equity and good conscience if a particular case is not covered by any of the provisions of the Act. But 
if it is covered, the Act must be applied.

IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS 
However, while explaining the provisions of the Act, the terms used are defined there itself, yet some of the 
important terms used under the Act are as follows: 
Instrument  
"Instrument" means a non-testamentary instrument. 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
347 
Attached to the earth 
Attach to the earth means: 
 
(a) rooted in the earth, as in the case of trees and shrubs; 
 
(b) imbedded in the earth, as in the case of walls or buildings; or 
 
(c) attached to what is so embedded for the permanent beneficial enjoyment of that to which it is 
attached. 
Absolute Interest 
When a person owns property, he has an "absolute interest" in the property. Ownership consists of a bundle 
of rights, the right to possession, right to enjoyment and right to do anything such as selling, mortgaging or 
making gift of the property. If A is the owner of a land, he has an absolute interest in the land. If A sells his 
land to B, then B becomes the owner and he acquires an absolute interest in the land he has purchased from 
A. Likewise if A makes a gift of his property to B, there again B gets an absolute interest in the property 
which is gifted to him. These are instances where persons may have an absolute interest. 
Reversion and Remainder 
Some interests in the property are called in English Law, reversion and remainders. A "reversion" is the 
residue of an original interest which is left after the grantor has granted the lessee a small estate. For 
example, A, the owner of a land may lease it to B for a period of five years. The person who grants the lease 
is the lessor and the person who takes the lease is called the lessee. Here, after the period of 5 years the 
lease will come to an end and the property reverts back to the lessor. The property which reverts back to him 
is called the reversion or the reversionery interest. The grantor has a larger and an absolute interest out of 
which he carves out a smaller estate and gives to the grantee, i.e. the lessee. 
When the owner of the property grants a limited interst in favour of a person or persons and gives the 
remaining to others, it is called a "remainder". For instance, A the owner of a land transfers property to B for 
life and then to C absolutely. Here the interest in favour of B is a limited interest, i.e., it is only for life. So long 
as A is alive he enjoys the property. He has a limited right since he cannot sell away the property. His right is 
only to enjoy the property. If he sells this interest it will be valid so long as he is alive. So after B’s death the 
property will go to C, interest is called a remainder. In the case of a "remainder", the property will not come 
back to the owner, but it goes over to the other person. 
Vested and Contingent Interests 
The word "vested" is used in two different senses. It may mean "vested in possession" or "vested in interest". 
A right is said to be "vested in possession" when it is a right to present possession of property and it is said 
to be "vested in interest" when it is not a right to present possession but a present right to future possession. 
For instance, if a land is given to A for life with a remainder to B, A’s right is vested in possession, B’s right is 
vested in interest. In the above example, the interest of B is not subject to any uncertain condition. It will 
come into his possession after A’s life comes to an end. Therefore, an interest is said to be vested when it is 
not subject to any condition, precedent, i.e., when it is to take effect on the happening of an event which is 
certain, whereas an estate is contingent when the right to enjoyment depends upon the happening of an 
event which may or may not happen. Thus, a gift to A on the death of B creates a vested interest in A even 
during the life time of B for there is nothing more certain than death. But a gift to A on the marriage of B 
creates a contingent interest, for B may never marry at all but that contingent interest becomes vested if and 
when B marries. 
EP-EBCL 
348 
A vested interest is transferable and heritable. If property is given to A for life and afterwards to B, B gets a 
vested interest and if B transfers this interest to C, C will take when the life estate of A comes to an end. B’s 
interest, since it is vested, is also heritable. Therefore, if B dies during the lifetime of A, C will get the property 
after the death of A. 
A contingent interest, as said above, is an interest which takes effect after the condition is satisfied. It is 
subject to a condition precedent, i.e., unless A marries B’s daughter, he will not get the property. The 
following example will illustrate this point. Property is given to A for life and then to B if he marries C. B 
should marry C before A dies. If he does so, his interest is converted into vested interest. Before B marries C 
his interest is contingent. The contingent interest is not heritable although it is transferable. In a vested 
interest the transfer is complete, but when the interest is contingent the transfer depends upon a condition 
precedent. In a condition precedent the estate is not vested in the grantee until the condition is fulfilled. 
Distinction between a vested and a contingent interest:  The following are the principal points of distinction 
between a vested and a contingent interest: 
 
1. When an interest is vested the transfer is complete. It creates an immediate proprietory interest in 
the property though the enjoyment may be postponed to a future date. A contingent interest on the 
other hand is dependant upon the fulfilment of some conditions which may or may not happen. In 
other words, in case of vested interest, the owner’s title is already prefect; in case of a contingent 
interest, the title is as yet imperfect but may become perfect on the fulfilment of a stipulated 
condition. 
 
2. A vested interest takes effect from the date of transfer. A contingent interest in order to become 
vested is conditioned by a contingency which may not occur. 
 
3. A vested interest cannot be defeated by the death of the transferee before he obtains possession. A 
contingent interest may fail in case of the death of transferee before the fulfilment of condition. 
 
4. Since vested interest is not circumscribed by any limitation which derogates from the completeness 
of the grant, it logically follows that a vested interest is transferable as well as heritable. If, therefore, 
a transferee of the vested interest dies before actual enjoyment, it will devolve on his legal heirs. A 
contingent interest, on the other hand, cannot be inherited though it may be transferred coupled with 
limitation regarding fulfilment of a condition. 
 
MOVEABLE AND IMMOVEABLE PROPERTY 
The term “property” signifies the subject matter over which the right of ownership or any less right carved out 
of ownership (e.g. mortgage right) is exercised. The Act deals with (i) various specific transfers relating to 
Immoveable property and (ii) lays down general principles relating to transfer of both moveable and 
immoveable property. Chapter II of the Act is divided into two parts. Parts A deals with the rules pertaining to 
both moveable and immoveable property (Section 5 to 37), Part B embodies the rules relating to immoveable 
property (Section 38 to 53A). The other chapters of the Act deal with transfers such as sales, mortgages, 
leases, gifts, exchanges and actionable claims. The rules relating to these transactions are referred to as 
rules governing special transfers to immoveable property. The fundamental rule relating to all transfers is that 
a transfer cannot be effected in any other way except as prescribed under the Act. Furthermore, the Act 
states that certain kinds of property cannot be transferred at all. 
The first task is to define and distinguish between moveable and immoveable property. 
Moveable property 
The Transfer of Property Act does not defines the term "moveable property". Therefore, it is to be defined 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
349 
with the help of other statutes. For e.g., it has been defined in the General Clauses Act, 1897 as to mean 
“property of every description except immoveable property”. The Registration Act defines "moveable 
property" to include property of every description excluding immoveable property but including standing 
timber, growing crops and grass. 
For the purpose of law, moveable property is sometimes regarded as immoveable property. This may 
happen when a thing of chattel is attached or embedded in earth. For instance, if a machinery or a plant is 
installed on the land, the question arises whether the machinery or the plant is moveable property or 
immoveable property. In order to find out whether such a thing or chattel is an immoveable property or not, it 
is to find out the mode of annexation of the thing and the object or purpose of such annexation. If the 
machinery is fixed on the land permanently then it becomes immoveable property, whereas if the machinery 
or engine or any other thing is fixed on a temporary basis, then it will be regarded as moveable property. 
Thus, where the owner of a piece of land installed a bone mill along with machinery being held by iron bars 
which have been dug to a considerable depth then it is a permanent fixture and this will become immoveable 
property. Similarly, the machinery installed on a cement platform and held in position by being attached to 
iron pillars fixed in the ground was held to be immoveable property as the annexation was made by the 
person who owned the buildings as well as the machinery (Mohamed Ibrahim v. Northern Circars Fibre 
Trading Company, A.I.R. 1944 Mad. 492). 
Immoveable property 
The term “immoveable property” is also not defined under the Act. However, it is defined in the negative 
sense as “the immoveable property does not include standing timber, growing crops, or grass” (S. 3 Para 2). 
Standing timber are trees fit for use for building or repairing houses. This is an exception to the general rule 
that growing trees are immoveable property. 
Growing crops:  It includes all vegetable growths which have no existence apart form their produce such as 
pan leaves, sugar cane etc. 
Grass:  Grass is moveable property, but if it is a right to cut grass it would be an interest in land and hence 
forms immoveable property. 
The General Clauses Act defines the term "immoveable property" but not exhaustively. It states: 
“immoveable property shall include land, benefits to arise out of land and things attached to the earth, or 
permanently fastened to any thing attached to the earth” [Section 3(25)]. The Indian Registration Act 
expressly includes under to immoveable property the benefits to arise out of land, hereditary allowances, 
rights of way, lights, ferries and fisheries. 
If the definitions of "immoveable property" as given in the Transfer of Property Act, the General Clauses Act 
and the Registration Act are viewed together, it is evident that they do not say what immoveable property is. 
They only say what is either included or excluded therein. Still, reading the definition in the Act with one in 
the General Clauses Act, immoveable property will be found to include land, benefit to arise out of land such 
as rent, and things attached to the earth like trees and buildings but not standing timber, growing crops and 
grass. The last three things are regarded as severable from the land on which they stand and, therefore, they 
are not included in the term "immoveable property". 
Thus, the meaning of immoveable property is as under: 
"Immoveable property" means land, benefits to arise out of land, and things attached to the 
earth, or permanently fastened to anything attached to the earth. 
EP-EBCL 
350 
“Attached to the earth” means (a) rooted in the earth, as in the case of trees and shrubs; (b) embedded in the 
earth, as in the case of walls or buildings; or (c) attached to what is so embedded for the permanent 
beneficial enjoyment of that to which it is attached (S. 3 Para 6 of the Act). 
Things rooted in the earth:  Trees and Shrubs are immoveable property according to this definition subject to 
the exception as to standing timber. 
Things embedded in the earth:  A house being embedded in the earth is immoveable property and this is so 
even if it is sold for enjoyment as a house with an option to pull it down. The mode of annexation and object 
of annexation are the two tests to determine whether it is immoveable property or not. 
Attached to what is so...:  The attachment must be as the section says for the permanent beneficial 
enjoyment of that to which it is attached e.g. the doors, windows of a house or moveable parts of fixed 
machinery. But the attachment must be intended to be permanent. 
A orally grants to B for Rs. 700/- the rights to catch and carry away fish from his lake. Is the grant valid? The 
Supreme Court in Ananda Behra v. State of Orissa, (1956) SCJ p. 96, that such a right is a benefit arising 
out of immoveable property namely the lake. So under General Clauses Act it is immoveable property. The 
sale requires a registered instrument for its validity under Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act. 
Therefore, the oral grant is invalid and cannot pass away any title in favour of B. 
Distinction between moveable and immoveable property 
The distinction between moveable and immoveable property was explained 
in the case of Sukry Kurdepa v. Goondakull, (1872) 6 Mad. H.C. 71, by 
Holloway J. as moveability may be defined to be a capacity in a thing of 
suffering alteration. Immoveablity for such alteration e.g., a piece of land in 
all circumstances is immoveable. If a thing cannot change its place without 
injury to the quality it is immoveable. Certain things e.g. trees attached to 
the ground are so long as they are so attached, immoveable when the 
severance has been effected they become moveable. 
The following have been recognised as immoveable property: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property

The following have been held not to be immoveable property: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RULES 
RELATING 
TO 
TRANSFER 
OF 
PROPERTY 
(WHETHER 
MOVEABLE 
OR 
IMMOVEABLE) 
According to Section 5 of the Transfer of Property Act, the term “transfer of property” means an act by which 
a living person conveys property in present, or in future, to one or more other living persons, or to himself, 
and one or more other living persons and "to transfer property" is to perform such an act. In this section, 
"living person" includes a company or association or body of individuals whether incorporated or not. But the 
general provisions of the Act as to transfer do not effect the special provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. 
To effect a transfer, property must be in existence. The word “transfer” is defined with reference to the word 
“convey”. The fundamental rule is that a transfer cannot be affected in any way not prescribed by the Act. 
The first point to note is that transfer inter vivos (i.e., between living persons) alone is contemplated by the 
Act. A transfer by means of a will is not a transfer according to the Act, because it is not a transfer between 
two living persons. Section 5 also says that the transfer may be “in present or in future”. The words in 
present or in future qualify the words ‘conveys’, and not the word ‘property’. A transfer of property not in 
existence operates as a contract to be performed in future which may be specially enforced as soon as the 
property comes into existence (Jugalkishore v. Ram Cotton Company, (1955) I SCR 1369). 
Further Section 6 (h) provides that no transfer can be made in so far as it is opposed to the nature of the 
interest attached thereby or for an unlawful object or consideration or to a person legally disqualified to be a 
transferee. 
WHO CAN TRANSFER THE PROPERTY? 
According to Section 7 of the Transfer of Property Act, every person who is competent to contract and 
entitled to transferable property, or authorised to dispose of property is competent to transfer such property. 
Hence, every person competent to contract and having ownership can trasnfer property. According to Indian 
Contract Act, a person is competent to contract when he is a major and of sound mind and is not disqualified 
from contracting by any law to which he is subject. But a minor can be a transferee as there is nothing in the 
EP-EBCL 
352 
Transfer of Property Act to disqualify a person, who is a minor to be a transferee. Thus, a mortgage can be 
validly executed in favour of a minor who has paid the consideration (Hari Mohan v. Mohini, 22 C.W.C. 130, 
Raghava v. Srinivasa, (1917) 60 Mad. 308). Persons who are authorised to transfer property can also 
transfer property validly. Although a minor is not competent to be a transferor yet a transfer to a minor is 
valid. However, there are exceptions to this: 
If a person holds himself out is the owner with the consent of the owner i.e. doctrine of holding out or if a 
person represents to be the owner i.e. doctrine of feeding the grant by estoppel. 
SUBJECT MATTER OF TRANSFER 
Section 6 of the Transfer of Property Act says that property of any kind may be transferred except as provided 
by this Act or any other law for the time being in force. The words “property of any kind” indicate that 
transferability is the general rule and the right to property includes the right to transfer the property to another 
person. Property of any kind excludes from its purview the future property. A transfer of future property can only 
operate as a contract which may be specifically performed when the property comes into existence. 
Exceptions to the general rule of transferability made by other laws 
Certain restrictions are placed by Hindu law and Mohammedan law on the transfer of property. 
FORMALITIES OF TRANSFER 
Property can be transferred either orally or by writing. Moveable property can be transferred by delivery of 
possession or by registration. Section 54 lays down the mode of transfer of immoveable property. Such 
transfer, in the case of tangible immoveable property of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards, or in 
the case of a reversion or other intangible thing, can be made only by a registered instrument. 
In the case of tangible immoveable property of a value less than one hundred rupees, such transfer may be 
made either by a registered instrument or by delivery of the property. 
The tangible property means a property which can be touched physically and hence, capable of physical 
dealing. 
The intangible property means something in abstract, either capable of being touched or perceived and yet 
standing in relation to a certain thing. 
‘Reversion’ means the bundle of rights remaining with the lessor after the execution of a lease of a certain 
immoveable property. 
When a transfer is effected in writing, the person who signs the document professing to transfer the property 
is called the executant. Execution consists in affixing his signature to the document to the effect that he is 
transferring the property. An illiterate person who cannot write may direct some literate person to sign it on 
his behalf and in his presence and the illiterate person may put his thumb impression. 
(i)  Attestation 
Attestation is an important formality in connection with the execution of transfer. "Attest" means to testify a 
factor, to bear witness to a fact. Attestation, in relation to a document, signifies the fact of authentication of 
the signature of the executant of that document by the attestator by putting down his own signature on the 
document in testimony of the fact of its execution. All transfers do not require attestation. For example, a sale 
or a lease does not require attestation. But a mortgage or a gift requires that a mortgage deed or a gift deed 
must be attested by two or more witnesses. 
Attestation is valid and complete when two witnesses sign the instrument. According to the definition given in 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
353 
the Transfer of Property Act (Section 3), the following essentials are required for a valid attestation: 
 
(a) There must be at least two or more witnesses; 
 
(b) Each witness must see (a) the executant’s sign or affix his mark to the instrument, or (b) some other 
person sign the instrument in the presence and by the direction of the executant, or (c) receive from 
the executant a personal acknowledgement of his signature or mark or of the signature of such 
other person; and 
 
(c) Each witness must sign the instrument, (i.e. document), in the presence of the executant. 
It is not necessary that both attesting witnesses should be present at the same time. The instrument may be 
attested after its execution by each of the attestators at different times. Attestation cannot take place before 
the execution of the deed. The Act does not insist on any particular form of attestation. The attesting witness 
may not be described as such on the face of the document (Yakub v. Kalzurkan, 52 Bombay 203). However, 
the attesting witness must have put his signature antmus attestandi, i.e., with intention to attest. Thus, where 
a Registrar or an identifying witness puts his signature on the document he cannot be regarded as an 
attesting witness unless it is duly proved that he signed with the necessary intention to attest. 
(ii)  Registration 
Registration is an essential legal formality to effect a valid transfer in certain cases. The advantage of 
registering a document is that any person who deals with the property would be bound by the rights that are 
created in earlier registered document. 
Illustration 
A executes a mortgage on property X and gets it registered. Subsequently he sells property X to B, B is 
bound by the right of the mortgagee over the property X. Thus, whether B knows actually or not that there 
was a mortgage the fact that the earlier document was registered is a notice to B and B takes property, 
subject to the rights of the mortgagee. Therefore, if a document of transfer relating to immoveable property is 
required by the law to be and has been effected by registered instrument, the persons who deal with the 
property subsequently are deemed in the eye of law as having knowledge of the such registered instrument 
from the date of its registration. 
(iii)  Notice 
Notice, may be actual or constructive. If a person knows about a fact, he has an actual notice. But, in certain 
circumstances law treats a man who ought to have known a fact even though he did not in fact know it. This 
is called constructive notice. 
The equitable doctrine of notice is recognised in various Sections of this Act. For instance in Section 39 of the 
Act, where a transfer is made of property out of which a person has a right to receive maintenance, the 
transferee takes subject to that right if he had notice of it, but not otherwise. Similarly under Section 40 if A 
conveys to C property, which he had by a previous contract agreed to sell to B, then B can enforce the contract 
against C, if C had notice of it, but not otherwise. If C had notice of the prior contract, he purchases with 
knowledge that it was unconscionable of A to sell to him, and it is therefore, unconscionable of him to buy. 
A person is deemed in the eye of law to have constructive notice of a fact when (i) but for willful absentation 
from an enquiry or search which he ought reasonably to have made; or (ii) gross negligence on his part, he 
would have known it. Constructive notice arises from an irrefutable presumption of notice. In law such a 
presumption will arise when (i) there is a willful absentation on the part of a person to make necessary 
enquiries regarding the existence of certain facts, or (ii) he showed gross negligence in the matter. 
EP-EBCL 
354 
The words “wilful absentation” suggest want of bona fide in respect of particular transaction (Joshua v. 
Alliance Bank, 22 Cal. 185). Thus, a person who refuses to receive a registered letter is, deemed to have 
constructive notice of its contents. 
Similarly, if a person proposes to sell his property to X who, at the same time knows that rents due in respect of 
the property are paid by the tenants to a third person Y, X will be fixed with notice of the rights of Y (Mernt v. 
Luck (1902) 1 Ch. 429). 
In so far as gross negligence is concerned, it does not mean a mere carelessness but means carelessness 
of such an aggravated nature as to indicate mental indifference to obvious risks. For example, if A buys 
property from B and does not care to ask whether any amount by way of municipal tax is due on that 
property and if the municipal corporation asks him to pay the arrears of tax, then B is responsible, and if he 
does not pay, then the arrears of tax may be made a charge on the property. 
Other Illustrations 
 
(a) Where a purchaser was informed that the title deeds were in the possession of a bank for safe 
custody and yet failed to make any enquiry in the bank. It was held that he was guilty of gross 
negligence and must be deemed to have notice of the rights of the bank which has the custody of 
the title needs (Imperial Bank of India v. Rai Gyand, I A 283). 
 
(b) Where a person abstained from making further enquiries about the right of a person and did not 
cause a search, to be made in the office of the Sub-Registrar to ascertain if there was any 
encumbrance over the property, his omission must be held to be wilful or grossly negligent and he 
would be said to have notice of the prior encumbrances (Rangappa Goundan v. Marapa Goundan, 
AIR (1958) Madras 515). 
The three Explanations to the definition of notice in Section 3, further mention certain circumstances wherein 
statutorily presumption of knowledge arises. These circumstances relate to the fact of registration 
(Explanation-I, Explanation-II) actual possession and notice to an agent (Explanation-III). 
 
RESTRAINT ON TRANSFERS OR RULE AGAINST INALIENABILITY 
Section 10 of the Act says that when property is transferred, the transferee should not be restrained 
absolutely from alienating the property. One may give property to another subject to a condition, but the 
condition should not be one which absolutely prevents the transferee from alienating the property. Suppose, 
B gives property to A and his heirs adding a condition that if the property is alienated it should revert to B. 
This condition is invalid and the transferee can ignore such condition. The transfer takes effect and is valid, 
and the condition not to alienate the property is void. 
Examples of absolute restraint 
Suppose, A gives to B property worth only 2,000 rupees and adds a condition that B should sell property for 
`50,000 and not below that amount, this condition will at once become invalid for no one will buy the property 
which is only worth `2,000 for Rs. 50,000. Similarly, A gives to B property worth `50,000 and stipulates that if 
B wants to sell the property he should sell it to C only for Rs. 1,000. This again will operate as an absolute 
restraint. In Rosher v. Rosher, (1884) 26, Ch. D. 801, the testator gave his estate to his son and added a 
condition that if his son wanted to sell the property he should first give an option to the testator’s wife who 
should be able to buy for £ 3,000. The market value of the property when the testator died was £ 15,000. It 
was held by the Court that the condition which compelled the son to sell the property for £ 3,000 was void. In 
Trichinpoly Varthaga Sangum v. Shunmoga Sunderam, (1939) Madras 954, there was a partition between a 
Hindu father and his five sons. The deed of partition provided that if any one of the sons wanted to sell his 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property

share, he should not sell it to a stranger but to one of his brothers who should have the option to buy for a 
sum not exceeding `1,000. It was held by the Court that the condition absolutely prevented the son from 
selling the property to any one for good value. In this case the market value of the property of the son was far 
greater than `1,000. Hence, the condition was declared invalid. 
Partial restraint valid 
Though absolute restraints are bad in law, partial restraints are valid. If there are conditions which restrain 
the transferee not to alienate the property outside the family, it has been held by the Courts that they are 
partial restraints. For example, whenever there are conditions in a family settlement whereby the members 
are not allowed to sell their shares to a stranger, such conditions are valid. 
But it is not permissible to restrict the alienation to a particular time. Such a restriction is not partial but an 
absolute restraint and as such invalid. 
When absolute restraint valid? 
There are two exceptions to the rule that absolute restraints are void. Firstly, in the case of a lease, the 
lessor can impose a condition that the lessee shall not sublet the property or sell his leasehold interest. Such 
conditions are valid. The reason why such an exception is made in the case of a lease is that the lessor may 
have confidence in the lessee but may not have the same confidence in some other person. So, if the lessor 
puts a condition restraining the lessee from transferring the property to someone, the condition is valid. 
The second exception is made in respect of a woman who is not a Hindu, Buddhist or Muslim. In such a 
case, a condition to the effect that she shall not have power during her marriage to transfer the property is 
valid. 
Restraint on enjoyment 
Section 11 of the Act also embodies a rule which is based on the principle that restraint on the enjoyment of 
the property is invalid. The section lays down that where land is transferred by one to another, the transferor 
should not impose conditions as to how and in what manner the transferee should enjoy the property. 
Illustrations 
 
(a) A sells his house to B and adds a condition that B only should reside in that house, the condition is 
invalid. This is subject to the exception that, if a person transfers a plot of land keeping another plot 
for himself, he can impose certain conditions which may interfere with the right of enjoyment of the 
transferee. 
 
(b) A has properties X and Y. He sells property Y to B and puts a condition that B should not construct 
on property Y more than one storey so that A’s property X which he retains should have good light 
and free air. 
Thus, it is clear in the above illustration that the condition which is imposed by A is for the benefit of another 
property which he retains. Such a condition is valid. 
Section 12 also makes the transfer void if a property is transferred to any person adding a condition that if 
such person becomes insolvent he ceases to hold that property. Such a condition is not recognised as valid 
in law. Again, this is subject to the exception that if a landlord leases his property he can impose a condition 
on the lessee that if the lessee becomes insolvent the lease should come to an end. 
TRANSFER FOR BENEFIT OF UNBORN PERSON 
Section 13 of the Transfer of Property Act lays down that where on a transfer of property, an interest therein 
EP-EBCL 
356 
is created for the benefit of a person not in existence at the date of transfer, subject to a prior interest created 
by the same transfer, the interest created for the benefit of such person shall not take effect unless it extends 
to the whole of the remaining interest of the transferor in the property. Thus if a property is given to an 
unborn person, two conditions should be satisfied: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Illustration 
A transfers property of which he is the owner to B in trust for A and his intended wife successively for their 
lives, and after the death of the survivor, for the eldest son of the intended marriage for life, and after his 
death for A’s second son. The interest so created for the benefit of the eldest son does not take effect, 
because it does not extend to the whole of A’s remaining interest in the property. 
CONDITIONAL TRANSFER 
When an interest is created on the transfer of property but is made to depend on the fulfillment of a condition 
by the transferee, the transfer is known as a conditional transfer. Such a transfer may be subject to a 
condition precedent or a condition subsequent. If the interest is made to accrue on the fulfilment of a 
condition, the condition is said to be condition precedent. For instance, A agrees to sell his land to B if B 
marries C. This is a condition precedent. The condition precedent will be allowed to operate only if it is not hit 
by the provisions of Section 25 of the Act. Section 25 in the first place, says that, the condition must not be 
impossible to fulfil. For example, A lets a farm to B on condition that he shall walk a hundred miles in an 
hour. The lease is void. Secondly, the condition must not be forbidden by law. Thirdly, it should not be of 
such a nature that if permitted it would defeat the provisions of any law. For instance, A transfers Rs. 500 to 
B on condition that he shall murder C. The transfer is void. Fourthly, it should not be fraudulent. For example, 
X gives a false receipt to Y on behalf of his principal in consideration of transfer of land. The transfer would 
be void. Fifthly, the condition should not be such as to cause injury to the person or property of another. And 
lastly the condition should not be immoral or opposed to public policy. Thus, an agreement to give a son or 
daughter in adoption for a consideration is opposed to public policy as trafficking in children is forbidden by 
law. 
If the condition is not hit by any of the above provisions, it is valid. Still the law does not insist on its literal 
fulfilment. It is sufficient if it is substantially complied with. Thus, where A transfers, Rs. 5,000 to B on 
condition that he shall marry with the consent of C, D and E. B marries with the consent of C and D only as E 
has died earlier. B is deemed to have fulfilled the condition. 
A transfer may also be made subject to a contingency which may or may not occur. Thus, an interest may be 
created with the condition superadded that it shall cease to exist in case a specified uncertain event shall 
happen, or in case a specified uncertain event shall not happen. 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
357 
This is known as condition subsequent. Condition subsequent is one which destroys or divests the rights 
upon the happening or non-happening of an event. For example, A transfers a farm to B for his life with a 
proviso that in case B cuts down a certain wood, the transfer shall cease to have any effect. B cuts down the 
wood. He loses his life interest in the farm. Similarly, if A transfers a farm to B provided that B shall not go to 
England within three years after the date of transfer, the interest in the farm shall cease. B does not go to 
England within the term prescribed. His interest in the farm ceases. 
Now you will notice the distinction between condition precedent and condition subsequent. In condition 
precedent, the condition comes before the interest; whereas in condition subsequent, the interest is created 
before the condition. The one precedes the vesting of right and the other follows the vesting. In condition 
precedent, the vesting of right is delayed until the happening of an event. In condition subsequent, there is 
no postponement of vesting of right though it is to be destroyed or divested by reason of non-fulfilment of 
condition. There are certain situations where the law says that either the transfer will take effect on the 
fulfillment of a condition or will not take effect at all. 
Again, if a transfer is made to defeat or delay the rights of a creditor, the transfer may be declared invalid by 
the creditor. In some cases, if property is transferred during the period when parties are litigating in a Court 
over a piece of property, then the transfer is not valid, or even if there is a transfer, it is subject to the rights 
that are created in the Court’s decree. All these circumstances are given in the Transfer of Property Act e.g., 
doctrine of election, doctrine of fraudulent transfers and doctrine of Lis pendens. 
DOCTRINE OF ELECTION 
Section 35 of the Transfer of Property Act deals with what is called doctrine of election. Suppose, a property 
is given to you and in the same deed of gift you are asked to transfer something belonging to you to another 
person. If you want to take the property you should transfer your property to someone else, otherwise you 
cannot take the property which is transferred to you by some one. Election may be defined as “the choosing 
between two rights where there is a clear intention that both were not intended to be enjoyed. 
The foundation of doctrine of election is that a person taking the benefit of an instrument must also bear 
the burden, and he must not take under and against the same instrument. It is, therefore, a branch of a 
general rule that no one may approbate and reprobate (Copper v. Copper (1874) H.L. 53). However 
doctrine of election could not be applied to deprive a person of his statutory right to appear invoking 
extraordinary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 136, (PR Deshpande v. MB Haribatti (1995 
(2) Scale 804 SC). 
Illustration 
A transfers to you his paddy field and in the same deed of transfer asks you to transfer your house to C. 
Now, if you want to have the paddy field you must transfer your house to C, because the transferor is 
transferring to you his paddy field on the condition that you give your house to C. 
Thus, either you take the paddy field and part with your house or do not take it at all. This is called the 
doctrine of election. You must elect either to take under the instrument, in which case you will have to fulfil 
the condition and bear the burden imposed upon you or you must elect against the instrument, in which case 
neither the benefit nor the burden will come to you. The doctrine is based on the principle that “a donee shall 
not be allowed to approbate and reprobate and that if he approbates, he shall do all in his power to confirm 
the instrument which he approbates” (Cavendish v. Decre 31 C.D. 466). 
In case, the person upon whom benefit is conferred rejects it, the property which was attempted to be 
transferred to him will revert to the transferor and it is he who will compensate the disappointed person. If the 
EP-EBCL 
358 
transferor dies before the person upon whom the benefit is conferred and he rejects the transfer, then the 
representatives of the transferor will have to satisfy the disappointed person out of the property which was 
the subject of transfer. 
Explanation of the above principle 
A transfers his property worth `1,000 and by the same instrument asks B to transfer his property worth `500 
to C. Here, if B does not accept, he will not take A’s property and the property will revert to A. If A is alive, it 
is for him to give some property to C. But if A dies before B has made his election then the heirs of A have to 
compensate C from A’s property to the extent of `500. (You will note that B’s property worth `500 was 
intended by A to be transferred to C). 
The question of Election arises only when a transfer is made by the same document. If the transferor makes 
a gift of property by one deed and by another asks the donee to part with his own property then there is no 
question of election. 
Illustration 
A transfers his land to B by a document. A by another document transfers B’s property to C. In this case B 
can retain the property given to him and refuse to transfer his property to C as the two transfers do not form 
part of the same document. 
Further, the doctrine of election is applicable if the benefit is given directly. A person taking no benefit directly 
under a transaction but deriving a benefit under it indirectly need not elect. 
Illustration 
A transfers his property to B’s son and by the same instrument transfer B’s property to C. In this case B need 
not to elect and can keep his property. His son can have his gift. 
There is, however, an exception to the doctrine of election. That is, if the transferor gives two benefits to a 
person and one particular benefit is in lieu of an item of property belonging to that person which the 
transferor has asked to transfer to a third-party then if the person elects to retain his property, he can retain 
the other benefit. 
Illustration 
Under A’s marriage settlement, his wife is entitled, if she survives him to the enjoyment of the estate of 
Sultanpur during her life. A by his will bequeaths to his wife an annuity of `200 p.m. during her life, in lieu of 
her interest in the estate of Sultanpur, which estates he bequeaths to his son. A also gives his wife a legacy 
of `1,000. After the death of A, his widow elects to take what she is entitled to take under the marriage 
settlement (i.e., the enjoyment of estate of Sultanpur). In this case, the wife has to forfeit the claim of `200 
which her husband has given to her. But she can claim other benefit i.e., `1,000. 
Election may be express or implied by conduct. 
Illustration 
A transfers to B an estate to which C is entitled, and as part of the same transaction gives C a coal mine. C 
takes possession of the mine and exhausts it. He has thereby confirmed the transfer. 
In case of disability, the condition shall be postponed until the disability ceases, or until the election is made 
by some competent authority. 
TRANSFER BY OSTENSIBLE OWNER OR DOCTRINE OF HOLDING OUT 
Where, with the consent, express or implied, of the persons interested in immoveable property, a person is 
the ostensible owner of such property and transfers the same for consideration, the transfer shall not be 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
359 
voidable on the ground that the transferor was not authorised to make it, provided that the transferee, after 
taking reasonable care to ascertain that the transferor had power to make the transfer, has acted in good 
faith. (Section 41) 
The following conditions are necessary for the application of Section 41: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If any one of these elements is absent, the transferee is not entitled to the protection of this section. 
This Section is a statutory application of the law of estoppel. The section makes an exception to the rule that 
a person cannot confer a better title than he has. An ostensible owner is one who has all the indicia of 
ownership without being the real owner. 
Illustrations 
 
(a) A made a gift of property to B but continued in possession of the gifted property. He purported to 
exercise a power of revocation and then transferred the property to the defendant. The gift, 
however, was not revocable as it was an unconditional gift. B seeks to recover possession from the 
defendant. The defendant invoked protection under Section 41.  
 
 In the given example, the donor is not an ‘ostensible owner’ holding the property with the consent of 
the real owner. The defendant cannot, therefore, invoke the protection of Section 41. 
 
(b) The manager of a joint Hindu family consisting of some minor members alienated the ancestral 
house to P without any necessity and the alienee transferred it to the defendants. The minors 
challenged the alienation. The defendants sought protection under Section 41. 
Here Section 41 has no application for “P was not the ostensible owner of the ancestral family house with the 
consent, express or, implied, of the persons interested in the said ancestral house in as much as the plaintiff, who 
had an interest in the said house, did not and could not by reason of the disability of infancy give their consent”. 
DOCTRINE OF FEEDING THE GRANT BY ESTOPPEL 
Where, a person fraudulently or erroneously represents that he is authorised to transfer certain immoveable 
property and professes to transfer such property for consideration, such transfer shall, at the option of the 
transferee, operate on any interest which the transferor may acquire in such property at any time during 
which the contract of transfer subsists. (Section 43) 
Nothing in this Section shall impair the right of transferees in good faith for consideration without notice of the 
existence of the said option. 
Essentials: In order to invoke this section, the transferee must prove that: 
The transferor is the ostensible owner
He is so by the consent express or implied, of 
the real owner
The transfer is for consideration
The transferee has acted in good faith taking 
reasonable care to ascertain that th e transferor 
had power to transfer
EP-EBCL

Illustration 
A, a Hindu, who has separated from his father B, sells to C three fields, X, Y and Z, representing that A is 
authorised to transfer the same. Of these fields, Z does not belong to A, it having been retained by B on the 
partition, but on B’s dying, A as heir obtains Z. C, not having rescinded the contract of sale may require A to 
deliver Z to him. Thus, where a grantor has purported to grant an interest in land which he did not at that time 
possess, but subsequently acquires, the benefit of his subsequent acquisition goes automatically to the 
earlier grantee or as it usually expressed, feeds the estoppel. 
DOCTRINE OF FRAUDULENT TRANSFER 
Where a person transfers his property so that his creditors shall not have anything out of the property, the 
transfer is called a fraudulent transfer. A debtor in order to defeat or delay the rights of a creditor, may 
transfer his property to some person, who may be his relative or a friend. The law does not allow this. 
Section 53 embodies the principle. It states: 
“Every transfer of immoveable property made with intent to defeat or delay the creditors of the transferor 
shall be voidable at the option of any creditor so defeated or delayed.” 
Thus, where an owner of the property contracts a debt and then transfers his property to someone so that 
the creditor cannot proceed against the property to realise his debt, such a transfer is voidable at the option 
of the creditor. The transfer is valid so long as the creditor does not challenge it in a Court of law and gets a 
declaration that the transfer is invalid. A suit instituted by a creditor to avoid a transfer on the ground that it 
has been made with intent to defeat or delay the creditors of the transfer or shall be instituted on behalf of, or 
for the benefit of all the creditors. Once the creditor sues the debtor and says that the debtor has the 
intention to deceive him, the transfer can be declared invalid by the Court. The creditor has to satisfy the 
Court that there was an intention on the part of the debtor to defeat his rights. If he does not prove this, then 
the creditor will fail and the transfer is valid. The question arises as to when we can say that the transferor 
has the necessary intention to defeat the claim of the creditor. This can be gathered from the surrounding 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
361 
circumstances. Suppose a man takes a loan from the creditor. He does not pay the loan. Then the creditor 
sues him in a Court to get back his debt. On seeing this the debtor transfers his property to a friend of his or 
some other person who simply holds the property on behalf of the transferor. Again, the debtor may make a 
gift of his property to his wife or sell it to a friend who will afterwards retransfer the same to the transferor. 
Under these circumstances, we can easily say that the debtor’s intention was to prevent the creditor from 
taking the property by a suit in the Court and to realise his debt. 
But suppose the debtor has several creditors and he transfers his property to one of his creditors in 
satisfaction of his whole debt to him. Is this also a fraudulent transfer? The answer is No. For a mere 
preference of one creditor over the others is not fraudulent under the Section, even if the whole property is 
so transferred and nothing is left for the other creditors. But the other creditors may file a petition in the Court 
within three months of the transfer praying that the debtor be declared insolvent. If the debtor is adjudicated 
an insolvent, their interest will be protected and the transfer will be declared as fraudulent preference. The 
transfer will be set aside and the property will be distributed among all the creditors. 
However, under Section 53(2) the rights of a transferee in good-faith and for consideration are protected. It 
says nothing shall affect or impair the rights of a transferee in good-faith and for consideration. 
DOCTRINE OF PART-PERFORMANCE 
Lastly, we may also discuss briefly the doctrine of part-performance which is embodied in Section 53A of the 
Transfer of Property Act. 
A contract for the sale of land has been entered into between A and B. The transferee has paid the price 
entering into possession and is willing to carry out his contractual obligations. As registration has not been 
effected A, the transferor, seeks to evict B from the land. Can he do so? No, B will not be allowed to suffer 
simply because the formality of registration has not been through. The legislature grants some relief to such 
a transferee under Section 53A, which embodies the doctrine of part-performance. 
The rule did not exist on the statute book before 1929. Section 53A, was inserted by an 
amendment to the Act in 1929. Followings are the essential conditions for the operation of the 
doctrine of part-performance according to Section 53A. 
 
1. There must be a contract to transfer immoveable property. 
 
2. It must be for consideration. 
 
3. The contract should be in writing and signed by the transferor himself or on his behalf. 
 
4. The terms necessary to constitute the transfer must be ascertainable with reasonable certainty from 
the contract itself. 
 
5. The transferee should have taken the possession of the property in part performance of the 
contract. In case he is already in possession, he must have continued in possession in part 
performance of the contract and must have done something in furtherance of the contract. 
 
6. The transferee must have fulfilled or be ready to fulfill his part of the obligation under the contract. 
If all the abovementioned conditions are satisfied, then, the transferor and the persons claiming under him 
are debarred form exercising any right in relation to the property other than the rights expressly provided by 
the terms of the contract notwithstanding the fact that the instrument of transfer has not been registered or 
complete in the manner prescribed therefor by the law for time being in force. It should be noted that Section 
53A does not confer any positive right on the transferee. It only prohibits exercise of the right of ownership in 
EP-EBCL 
362 
relation to the property in order to evict the transferee from the property because legal requirements have not 
been satisfied. 
However, the doctrine of part-performance will not affect the right of a subsequent transferee for 
consideration without notice of the earlier contract and of its being partly performed. 
The right conferred by this section is a right only available to a defendant to 
protect his possession. This section does not create a title on the defendant. It 
merely operates as a bar to the plaintiff asserting his title. It is limited to cases 
where the transferee had taken possession, and against whom the transferor is 
debarred from enforcing any right other than that expressly provided by the 
contract. The section imposes a bar on the transferor. When the conditions 
mentioned in the sections are fulfilled, it debars him from enforcing against the transferee any right 
or interest expressly provided by the contract. So far as the tranferee is concerned, the section 
confers a right on him to the extent it imposes a bar on the transferor (Delhi Motor Co. v. Basurkas, 
(1968) SCR 720). 
The English rules as to what acts constitute part-performance have been generally followed in India. These 
rules are as follows: 
 
(1) An act of part-performance must be an act done in performance of the contract. An act introductory 
to and previous to the agreement, cannot therefore, be act of part-performance. 
 
(2) The acts relied upon must be unequivocally and referable to no other contract than that alleged. 
 
(3) An act of part-performance must be the act of the party seeking to avail himself of the equity. 
 
PROPERTIES WHICH CANNOT BE TRANSFERRED 
Section 6 of this Act contains some exceptions to the general rule that property of any kind may be 
transferred. Consequently, the following properties cannot be transferred, namely: 
 
(a) the chance of an heir apparent succeeding to an estate, the chance of a relation obtaining a legacy 
on the death of a kinsman or any other mere possibility of a like nature cannot be transferred. 
 
(b) A mere right of re-entry for breach of a condition subsequent cannot be transferred to any one 
except the owner of the property affected thereby. 
 
(c) An easement cannot be transfered apart from the dominant heritage. 
 
(d) An interest is property restricted in its enjoyment to the owner personally cannot be transferred by 
him. 
 
(e) A right to future maintenance in whatsoever manner arising, secured or determined, cannot be 
transferred. 
 
(f) A mere right to sue cannot be transferred. 
 
(g) A public office cannot be transferred nor can the salary of a public officer, whether before or after it 
has become payable. 
 
(h) Stipends allowed to military, naval, air force and civil pensioners of the Government and political 
pensions cannot be transferred. 
(a)  Chance of an heir apparent or ‘Spes Successionis’ 
In this clause possibilities referred are bare or naked possibilities and not coupled with an interest such as 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
363 
contingent remainders or future interest-also known as right of spes successionis which cannot be the 
subject to transfer. 
When a person is the owner of property, the property is in existence and it is in his possession. This he may 
transfer. But if property is neither in existence nor is the person the owner of the property then it cannot be 
transferred. For example, if a person is intending to buy certain property but, he has no interest in that 
property, he cannot transfer it unless the property comes to his hands, i.e., unless he becomes the owner of 
the property after buying it. But if a person obtains certain consideration and agrees to sell the property of 
which he is not the owner, then on becoming the actual owner of the property he has to transfer the property 
as there was a contract between him and the person who has agreed to buy the property. This transfer 
operates on a contract to be performed when the property comes into the hands of the person who has 
agreed to transfer. But where a person wants to make a gift of the property which is to come in his hands in 
future, he cannot transfer it because a gift is voluntary transfer without any consideration. Thus a gift of future 
property is void. Similarly, the chance of a heir apparent succeeding to the estate of a deceased person 
cannot be transferred. Suppose A is the owner of the property and B is his son. B is the heir of A. During the 
life time of his father A, B has only a hope expectancy that he will inherit the property of his father. This type 
of property which B hopes to get after the death of the father cannot be transferred, during the life time of A. 
Illustrations:  
(a) Suppose A, a Hindu who has separate property, dies leaving a widow W and a brother L, L’s succession 
to the property is dependent upon two factors, viz., (i) his surviving the widow, W, and (ii) W leaving the 
property intact. L has only a bare chance of succession to the property left by A. This is spes successionis, 
and therefore, cannot be transferred (Amrit Narayana v. Gyan Singh, (1918) 45 Cal. 690). 
(b) A transfers to B for valuable consideration his reversionary interest in a property. When A succeeds to the 
property, B sues him for possession of the same. B will not succeed as the reversionary interest is a spes 
successionis and non-transferable. So the transfer is void and B’s suit for possession fails. 
(b)  Right of re-entry 
The right which the lessor has against the lessee for breach of an express condition which provides that on 
its breach the lessor may re-enter is called the right of re-entry. For instance, if A leases his property to B 
and adds a condition that if B sub-lets the leased land, A will have the right to re-enter, i.e., the lease will 
terminate if the lessee breaks the condition by subletting to a third person. Thus, right of re-entry being a 
right for the personal benefit of any party cannot exist for the benefit of a person who has no personal 
interest in the land. For example, A grants his land by way of lease to B, a limited liability company on 
condition that the land should revert to A from B if the company goes into liquidation. This is a mere right in 
favour of A and this right A cannot transfer to anyone as this is a personal right which can be exercised by A 
only. But if A transfers the whole of his interest in the land including the right of re-entry to C, there the right 
to re-entry is a legal incident of property and can be validly transferred along with the property. 
(c)  Transfer of easement 
An easement is a right enjoyed by the owner of land over the land of another: such as, right of way, right of 
light, right of support, right to a flow of air or water. Section 4 of the Easements Act defines an easement as a 
right which the owner or occupier of certain land possesses as such for the beneficial enjoyment of the land, 
to do and continue to do something or to prevent and to continue to prevent something being done in or upon 
or in respect of certain other and not his own land. An easement includes a right to enjoy a profit out of the 
land of another. An easement exists for the accommodation and better enjoyment of the land to which it is 
annexed. The land owned by the possessor of the land is known as dominant tenement and the land over 
EP-EBCL 
364 
which the right is enjoyed is known as the servient tenement. As an easement confers no proprietory right on 
its owner, it cannot be transferred apart from the land itself. For example, the right of certain villagers to bath 
in another’s tank cannot be transferred. Similarly if A, the owner of a house X, has a right of way over an 
adjoining plot of land belonging to B, he cannot transfer this right of way to C. But if he transfers the house 
itself to C, the easement is also transferred to C. 
It may be noted, however, that the prohibition is only with regard to transfer of an existing easement. The law 
does not prohibit the grant or creation of new easement (Bhagwan Sahai v. Narsing. (1909) 31 ALL. 612; 
Satyanarayana v. Lakshamaya 5 H.L.J. 56 or the extension of an easement by release in favour of the owner 
of servient tenement). 
(d)  Restricted interest or personal interest 
An interest restricted in enjoyment to the owner personally is by its very nature not transferable unless the 
restriction is void under Section 10. Examples of such restricted interest or property are the following: 
 
(i) The right of pre-emption given under the Mohammedan Law. 
 
(ii) The office of a Shebait of a Temple or mohunt of a mutt or mutuwalli of a wakf. 
 
(iii) Emoluments attached to a priestly office. 
 
(iv) Service tenures. 
(e)  Right to future maintenance 
This again is a personal right in the property which the law says that it cannot be transferred. The right of a 
Hindu widow to maintenance is a personal right which cannot be transferred. Under the law the arrears of 
past maintenance can be transferred, but not the right to future maintenance. 
(f)  Mere right to sue and actionable claim 
A ‘mere right to sue’ apart from the interest from which such right accrues cannot be assigned. The ‘right to 
sue’ is a personal right annexed to the ownership of property and cannot be severed, from it. It is based on 
the principle of public policy to prevent multiplicity of suits; the object is mainly to prevent the abuse resulting 
from trafficking in litigation. 
The use of the word "mere" is significant. The question in every case is whether the subject-matter of transfer 
is property with an incidental remedy for its recovery or is a ‘mere’ right to ‘sue’. Where property is 
transferred along with a right to recover damages or compensation in respect of the property, the assignment 
is not hit by clause (4) of Section 6 of the T.P. Act. 
A mere right to sue cannot be transferred. The right refers to a right to damages arising both out of contracts 
as well as torts. For example, A commits an assault on B, B can file a suit to obtain damages; but B cannot 
assign the right to C and allow him to obtain damages. In contract also, the rule is the same. If A breaks a 
contract which he has entered into with B, B can bring action for damages, but B cannot transfer this right to 
C to recover damages. 
There is clear distinction between an actionable claim and a mere right to sue. An actionable claim is 
property and the assignee has a right to sue to enforce the claim. 
As already noted a right to recover an unascertained amount of damages resulting from breach of contract or 
tort is a mere right to sue. If, however, one has a right to recover an ascertained and definite debt, he may 
transfer it because it is an actionable claim. Thus, suppose A is indebted to B for Rs. 2,000 and B transfers 
the right to recover the debt of C, the transfer is void. A beneficial interest in specific moveable property is 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
365 
also an actionable claim. It has been held that the right to claim the benefit of an executory contract 
constitutes a beneficial interst in moveable property (Jaffer Meher Ali v. Budge Budge Jute Mills, (1900) 33 
Cal. 702). 
After breach of a contract for the sale of goods nothing is left but a right to sue for damages which cannot be 
transferred. But before breach the benefit of an executing contract for the sale of goods may generally be 
transferred and the buyer has the right to sue for the goods. 
(g)  Transfer of public office and salaries, stipends, etc. 
It is against public policy for a public officer to transfer the salary of his office, for the salary is given for the 
purpose of upholding its dignity and the proper performance of its duties. Civil and military pensions are not 
transferable. A pension retains its character as long as it is unpaid and is in the hands of Government, but as 
soon as it is paid to the pensioner or his legal representatives, it can be transferred. Since these allowances, 
pensions and stipends are given on personal basis, the law does not allow these types of property to be 
transferred. 
RULE AGAINST PERPETUITY 
Section 14 of the Act provides that no transfer of property can operate to create an interest which is to take 
effect after the life time of one or more persons living at the date of such transfer, and the minority of some 
person who shall be in existence at the expiration for that period, and to whom, if he attains full age, the 
interest created is to belong. 
The rule against perpetuity is based on the general principle that the liberty of alienation shall not be exercised 
to its own destruction and that all contrivances shall be void which tend to create a perpetuity or place property 
forever out of the reach of the exercise of the power of alienation. Perpetuity has been described as 
“exemptions from intermission or ceasing”. This has been said to be “odious in law, destructive to the 
commonwealth, and an impediment to commence, but preventing the wholesome circulation of property”. 
A perpetuity in the primary sense of the word, “is a disposition which makes property inalienable for an 
indefinite period” (Jarman on Wills, 8th ed., vol. 1, P. 284). Section 14 of the Act adopted with certain 
modifications the English rule against perpetuities which is enunciated by Jarman as “Subject to the 
exceptions to be presently mentioned, no contingent or executory interest in property can be validity created, 
unless it must necessarily vest within the maximum period of one or more lives in being and twenty-one 
years afterwards”. Section 14 of the Act fixes the perpetuity period as: Life (or Lives) living at the time of 
transfer and actual minority of the then unborn ultimate transferee. 
Any number of successive estates can be created between the transferees who are living persons e.g. A 
transfer may be made to A for life and then to B for life and then to C for life and so on, provided that A, B 
and C are all living persons at the date of the transfer. But if the ultimate beneficiary is some one who is not 
in existence at the date of the transfer, the whole residue of the estate should be transferred to him. If he is 
born before the termination of the last prior estate, he takes a vested interest at birth and takes possession 
on the termination of the last prior estate but if he is not born till the termination of the last prior estate, the 
transfer to him fails. 
Further, the rule is not that vested interest is created at the birth of the beneficiary but that vested interest 
cannot be delayed in any case beyond his minority. Therefore, the rule against perpetuity is that the minority 
of the ultimate beneficiary is the latest period at which an estate can be made to vest. 
EP-EBCL 
366 
In India minority terminates at the end of 18 years. 
The rule against perpetuities applies to both moveable and immoveable property. 
Thus, the rule against perpetuity contains two propositions, i.e.: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, Section 18 provides an exception to the above rule of perpetuity, where the transfer of property is 
for the benefit of the public in the advancement of religion, knowledge, commerce, health, safety, or any 
other object beneficial to mankind. 
Effect of a transfer on failure of prior interest 
Further, where by reason of any rules or the rules contained in Sections 13 and 14, interest created for the 
benefit of a person or class of persons fails in regard to such person or the whole of such class, any interest 
created in the same transaction and intended to take effect or upon failure of such prior intersts also fail 
(Section 16). For example, property is transferred to A for life then to his unborn son B for life and then to C, 
who is living at the date of transfer, absolutely. Here B is given only a life interest. So the transfer to B is 
invalid under Section 13. The subsequent transfer to C absolutely is also invalid, because according to 
Section 16, if a prior transfer fails, the subsequent transfer will also fail. 
No transfer of property can operate to create an interest which is to take effect after the life time of one or 
more persons living at date on such transfer, and the minority of some person who shall be in existence on 
the expiration of that period, to whom, if he attains full age, the interest created is to belong. 
The policy of the law has been to prevent property being tied up for ever. The vesting cannot be postponed 
beyond the life time of any person living at the date of transfer. For example, if an estate is given to a living 
person A for life and then to the unborn son of A, the son of A must be in existence on or before the date of 
the expiry of the life estate in favour of A. The vesting of absolute interest in favour of an unborn person may 
be postponed until he attains majority. For example, an estate may be transferred to A, living person, and 
after his death to his unborn son when he attains the age of 18. Such transfer would not be violative of the 
rule against perpetuity. 
ACCUMULATION OF INCOME 
Section 17 does not allow accumulation of income from the land for an unlimited period without the income-
being enjoyed by owner of the property. The law allows accumulation of income for a certain period only. The 
period for which such accumulation is valid is : 
 
(a) the life of the transferor, or 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
367 
 
(b) eighteen years from the date of transfer. 
Any direction to accumulate the income beyond the period mentioned above is void except where it is for: 
 
(i) the payment of the debts of the transferor or any other person taking any interest under the 
transferor, 
 
(ii) portions for children or any other person taking any interest in the property under the transfer, and 
(iii) for the preservation and maintenance of the property transferred. 
DOCTRINE OF LIS PENDENS 
Lis means dispute, Lis pendens means a pending suit, action, petition or the like. Section 52 of the T.P. Act 
incorporates the doctrine of Lis pendens. It states that during the pendency of a suit in a Court of Law, 
property which is subject to a litigation cannot be transferred. When we say that property cannot be 
transferred what we mean in this context is that property may be transferred but this transfer is subject to the 
rights that are created by a Court’s decree. For example, A and B are litigating in a Court of law over 
property X and during the pendency of the suit A transfers the property X to C. The suit ends in B’s favour. 
Here C who obtained the property during the time of litigation cannot claim the property. He is bound by the 
decree of the Court wherein B has been given the property. 
Section 52 lays down the Indian rule of Lis pendens being the legislative expression of the Maxim- “ut lite 
pendente nihil innovetur” ‘During litigation nothing new should be introduced’. 
Essentials 
In order to constitute a Lis pendens, the following elements must be present: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The rule is based on the doctrine of expediency i.e., the necessity for final adjudication. A plea of lis pendens 
will be allowed to be raised even though the point is not taken in the pleadings or raised as an issue. 
When an application to sue in forma pauperis is admitted, the suit is pending from the time of presentation of 
the application to the Court but not if it is rejected. 
A suit in foreign Court cannot operate as lis pendens. The doctrine of lis pendens does not apply to 
EP-EBCL 
368 
moveables. It is the essence of the rule that a right to immoveable property is directly and specifically in 
question in the suit. The doctrine is not applicable in favour of a third-party. 
Effect 
If the parties to the litigation, are completely prevented from transferring the property in litigation, it would 
cause unnecessary delay and hardship, as they would have to wait till the final disposal of the case. So, 
Section 53 creates a limitation over the transfer by making it subject to the result of the litigation. The effect 
of this doctrine is not to invalidate or avoid the transfer, or to prevent the vesting of title in the transfer, but to 
make it subject to the decision of the case, and the rule would operate even if the transferee pendente lite 
had no notice of the pending suit or proceeding at the time of the transfer. 
PROVISIONS RELATING TO SPECIFIC TRANSFERS 
The Act expressly provides for special types of transfers such as sale, exchange, gift, mortgage and lease. 
These are as follows: 
In a sale, exchange and gift, there is a transfer of the ownership of property but mortgage is a transfer of an 
interest in specific immoveable property and lease is a transfer of the right to enjoy immoveable property. 
1.  Sale 
 
Under Section 54 of the T.P. Act, "sale" has been defined as a transfer of ownership in exchange 
for a price paid or promised or part paid and part-promised. 
 
Essentials 
 
(a) The seller must be a person competent to transfer. The buyer must be any person who is not 
disqualified to be the transferee under Section 6(h)(3). 
 
(b) The subject matter is transferable property. 
 
(c) There is a transfer of ownership. This feature distinguishes a sale from mortgage, lease etc., where 
there is no such transfer of ownership. 
 
(d) It must be an exchange for a price paid or promised or part paid and part promised. 
 
(e) There must be present a money consideration. If the consideration is not money but some other 
valuable consideration it may be an exchange or barter but not a sale. 
Mode of transfer by sale 
Sale of an immoveable property can be effected, 
 
(a) Where such property is tangible (i) by a registered instrument if it is of the value of Rs. 100 and 
upwards, and (ii) by a registered instrument or by delivery of property when it is less than Rs. 100 in 
value, and 
 
(b) Where the property is tangible or a reversion, only by a registered instrument. 
Contract for sale 
A contract for the sale of immoveable property differs from a contract for the sale of goods in that the Court 
will grant specific performance of it unless special reasons to the contrary are shown. 
The rights and liabilities of a seller and buyer are dealt with in Section 55 of the Transfer of Property Act. 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
369 
2.  Exchange 
Sections 118 to 121 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deal with "Exchanges". 
When two persons mutually transfer the ownership of one thing for the ownership of another, 
neither thing or both things being money only, the transaction is called an "exchange". 
 
Essentials 
 
(i) The person making the exchange must be competent to contract. 
 
(ii) There must be mutual consent. 
 
(iii) There is a mutual transfer of ownership though things and interests may not be identical. 
 
(iv) Neither party must have paid money only. 
This Section applies to both moveable and immoveable property. 
Mode of exchange 
A transfer of property in completion of an exchange can be made only in the matter provided for the transfer 
of such property by sale. 
3.  Gift 
The provisions relating to "Gifts" have been stipulated under Sections 122 to 128 of the Act. 
Section 122 of the Transfer of Property Act defines "gift" as follows: 
“Gift" is the transfer of certain existing moveable or immoveable property made voluntarily and 
without consideration by one person called the donor, to another called the donee and 
accepted by or on behalf of the donee. 
Such acceptance must be made during the life time of the donor and while he is still capable 
of giving. If the donee dies before acceptance, the gift is void. 
Essentials 
 
1. There must be a transfer of ownership. 
 
2. The subject matter of gift must be a certain existing moveable or immoveable property. 
 
3. The transfer must be made voluntarily. 
 
4. It must be done without consideration. 
 
5. There must be acceptance by or on behalf of the donee, and such acceptance must be made during 
the lifetime of the donor and while he is capable of giving. 
There are two parties to the gift: donor and donee. The donor must be a person competent to transfer; 
whereas the donee may be any person. The gift can be made to any one, to an incompetent person or even 
to a juridicial person. The essence of a gift is that it is a gratuitous transfer. 
According to Section 123, a gift of immoveable property must be made by a registered instrument signed by 
or on behalf of the donor and attested by at least two witnesses. A gift of moveable property may be made by 
a registred instrument or by delivery of property. Where the donee is already in possession of the moveable 
property, as no future delivery is possible, the donor may make a declaration of the gift in his favour. For 
example, where a piece of furniture or a television set belonging to the donor is lying with a friend of his, the 
EP-EBCL 
370 
donor may simply declare that he makes a gift of the furniture or the television set and the gift is complete. 
The declaration must be clear and the donee must accept the gift. 
A gift of immoveable property, as said above, must be effected by registration. Where a gift in favour of 
someone is registered but it is not accepted by the donee, the gift is incomplete. Suppose, a document is 
executed by the donor who makes a gift of immoveable property and the deeds are delivered to donee, and 
the donee accepts the gifts but the document is not registered. Will the gift be valid? It has been held by the 
Courts that the gift is valid. While registration is a necessary formality for the enforcement of a gift of 
immoveable property, it does not suspend the gift until registration actually takes place. The donee in such a 
case can ask the donor to complete the gift by registration. Thus, the most essential thing for the validity of a 
gift is its acceptance. If the gift is accepted but not registred it is a valid gift. The Privy Council in Kalyan 
Sundram v. Kumarappa, A.I.R. 1925 P.C. 42, decided that after acceptance of the deed of gift and before 
registration, the donor cannot revoke the gift. The gift which is accepted by the donee, will take effect from 
the date of the execution of the document by the donor, even though it is registered at a later date. 
If the deed of gift is executed but never communicated to the intended donee and remains in the possession 
of the donor undelivered, it cannot be compulsory registered at the instance of the donee. The reason is that 
the donee did not accept the gift, the donor can at any time before such acceptance revoke the gift. But once 
a gift is accepted by the donee, the donor cannot revoke it. A gift may, however, be revoked if it is brought 
about by a fraud or misrepresentation or undue influence. 
The other essential characteristic of a gift is that it cannot be revoked at the will and pleasure of the grantor. 
A revocable gift is one which may be revoked by the donor at any time. Its revocation would depend upon 
the mere will or pleasure of the donor. Such a gift is void. But on the other hand, if the condition is one which 
does not depend on the will or pleasure of the donor, the gift can be revoked on the happening of such 
condition. 
Illustrations 
 
(a) A gives a field to B, reserving to himself, with B’s assent, the rights to take back the field in case B 
and his descendents die before A, B dies without descendents during A’s lifetime. A may take back 
the field. 
 
(b) A gives a lakh of rupees to B, reserving to himself with B’s assent the right to take back at leisure 
Rs. 10,000 out of one lakh. The gift holds goods as to Rs. 90,000 but is void as to Rs. 10,000 which 
continues to belong to A. 
A gift which comes into existence on the fulfilment of a condition, that is to say, a gift which is subject to a 
condition precedent is also valid. A condition precedent, as already explained in this study dealing with 
vested interest and contingent interest, is one which must be fulfilled before the transfer takes effect. But the 
condition attached to the gift should not be illegal or immoral. For instance, a gift to A on condition that he 
murders B is not valid. 
A gift comprising both of existing property and future property is void as to the latter. For example, A makes a 
gift of his house and also makes a gift of the additions that he is likely to make in future. Here the gift of the 
house is valid but the gift of the additions that are yet to be made is invalid. 
Onerous gift:  Lastly reference may also be made to what is known as an onerous gift. It may be that several 
things are transferred as a gift by single transaction. Whereas some of them are really beneficial the others 
convey burdensome obligations. The result is that the benefit which it confers is more than counter balanced 
by the burden it places. For instance, A makes a gift of shares in the companies X and Y. X is prosperous 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
371 
but heavy calls are expected in respect of shares in Y company. The gift is onerous.The rule as laid down in 
Section 127 is that the donee takes nothing by the gift unless he accepts it fully. Where the gift is in the form 
of two or more independent transfers to the same person of several things, the donee is at liberty to accept 
one of them and refuse the other. 
The rules pertaining to gifts in the Transfer of Property Act do not apply to the gifts by Mohammedans. If a 
gift is made by a Mohammedan, its validity has to be judged according to Muslim law and not according to 
the Transfer of Property Act. 
4.  Leases 
(i)  Meaning and nature of lease:  According to Section 105, a "lease" of immoveable 
property is a transfer of a right to enjoy property. Since it is a transfer to enjoy and 
use the property, possession is always given to the transferee. The lease of 
immoveable property must be made for a certain period. For example, you may give 
a lease of property for a definite number of years, or for life, or even permanently. 
 
Essentials 
The essentials of a lease are: 
 
(1) It is a transfer of a right to enjoy immoveable property; 
 
(2) Such transfer is for a certain time or perpetuity; 
 
(3) It is made for consideration which is either premium or rent or both; 
 
(4) The transfer must be accepted by the transferee. 
The transferor is called the lessor, the transferee is called the lessee, the price is called premium and the 
money, share, service or any other thing of value to be so rendered is called the rent. 
The parties to the lease (i.e. lessor and lessee), must be competent to make and to take the lease 
respectively. 
(ii)  Lease and licence:  A lease should be distinguished from a licence. A licence is a right to do or continue 
to do in or upon the immoveable property of the grantor, something which would, in the absence of such a 
right, be unlawful. 
A licence does not transfer any interest in the property and the licencee has no right to possession. A licence 
can be revoked by the grantor at any time, whereas a lease cannot be revoked. If, I sell the fruits of my 
garden to you, you are given permission or licence to enter my garden and take away the fruits. A lease 
involves a transfer of interest followed by possession of the property for a specified period. The real test is 
the intention of the parties.  
If the document creates an interest in the property, it is a lease but if it only permits another to make use of 
the property of which the legal possession continues with the owner, it is a licence because it does not create 
any interest in that property (Associated Hotel of India v. R.N. Kapoor, A.I.R. (1956) S.C. 1962).  
The question is not of words but of substance and the label which the parties choose to put upon the 
transaction though relevant is not decisive. 
(iii)  Formalities:  According to Section 107, a lease from year to year or for any term exceeding one year can 
be made only by a registered document. If a lease is  for a term below one year, it can be made by an oral 
agreement. If a lease is created by oral agreement, it must be accompanied by delivery of possession. If the 
EP-EBCL 
372 
lease is for a year or more, it must be effected by a registered document. If after the registration, the lessor 
does not give possession, the lessee can sue for possession. 
(iv)  Types of tenancies:  Following are the various types of tenancies: 
 
(a) Tenancy from year to year:  A tenancy from year to year may be made by a grant of land from year 
to year. If the tenancy is for a year to start with but after the expiration of one year the lessee 
continues to be in possession and pays the rent to the landlord, the tenancy is regarded as a year-
to-year tenancy. If, in case of a tenancy for a period more than a year the landlord wants to 
terminate or end the lease, he has to give a six-month’s notice to the lessee to quit. In case of a 
tenancy from month to month, a fifteen days notice to quit is necessary. The monthly tenancy may 
be created either by contract or may be presumed from the nature of the tenancy to be one, from 
month to month. 
 
(b) Tenancy-at-will:  Tenancy-at-will is a tenancy recognised by law. This comes into existence where a 
tenant holds over with the consent is let into occupation. We have stated above that if the tenant 
continues to be in possession after the expiration of tenancy and pays the rent to the landlord, the 
tenancy may be one from year to year or from month to month. During a period when the tenant is 
in possession after expiry of the period, if the tenant stays with the consent of the landlord till such 
time as further period is fixed or a fresh contract is made, the tenant is called a tenant-at-will. The 
landlord will decide for what further period shall the tenancy be given. ‘A tenancy-at-will is implied 
when a person is in possession by the consent of the owner and is not held in view of any tenancy 
for a certain time. The tenancy-at-will does not mean that the landlord has to give a proper notice to 
quit. The tenant-at-will cannot sublet during that period because no valid contract for further 
extension in his favour has been made. The death of the landlord or tenant determines the tenancy, 
i.e., the tenancy comes to an end. 
 
(c) A tenancy by sufferance:  This is a tenancy which is created by fiction of law. If a tenant continues 
to be in possession after the determination of the period of the lease without the consent of the 
landlord, he becomes a tenant by sufferance. A tenant-at-will is in possession with the consent of 
the landlord, whereas a tenant by sufferance is in possession without his permission after the term 
of the lease comes to an end. This type of tenant is not regarded as a trespasser because the 
tenant had in his favour a valid lease to start with. No notice is necessary to such a tenant for 
eviction. This tenant is not responsible for rent. He is liable to pay compensation for use and 
occupation of the land. 
(v) Requirements of a valid notice:  In order that a notice to quit is valid it must be a proper notice. The notice 
must convey the intention to terminate the tenancy as a whole and must specify the date on which the 
tenancy would expire. As mentioned earlier, if the lease is a lease from month to month, 15 days, notice is 
required. If it is from year to year 6 months’ notice is required. A lease of the moveable property for 
agricultural or manufacturing purposes shall be deemed to be a lease from year to year. The notice should 
expire with the end of the period of the tenancy. If it is a lease from month to month and the notice is given 
by the landlord, the tenant should be asked to quit at the end of the month of the tenancy. The landlord 
cannot ask his tenant to quit at any time before the expiry of a month or a year of the tenancy. 
 (vi)  Determination of leases:  Section 111 of the Transfer of Property Act spells out the various 
contingencies in which a lease comes to an end. A lease is determined, i.e., comes to an end in the following 
ways: 
 
(1) By efflux of time or lapse of time:  A lease for a definite period, such as a lease for a year, or for a 
term of years, expires on the last day of the term and the lessor or any person entitled to get back 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
373 
the property may enter without notice or any other formality. Since a lease is a transfer of interest in 
the property, if during the period for which a lease is valid, the lessee dies, the heirs of the lessee 
can continue the lease till the expiry of the period. 
 
(2) By the happening of a special event:  When a lease is granted subject to the happening of an event, 
it comes to an end when the event takes place. Thus, if B grants lease to A for life, it comes to an 
end on the death of A. Similarly, if a lease is granted for the duration of the war, it comes to an end 
when the war ends. Where the interest of the lessor is limited, the lease comes, to an end when he 
loses the interest or where he does not have any power to grant a lease. For example, a tenant for 
life can grant a lease only to last during his life time. It comes to an end on his death. 
 
(3) Merger:  A lease comes to an end when the lessee buys the property of the lessor or when the 
lessee takes the lessor’s interest by succession. Here the right of the lessee merges in that of the 
lessor. Naturally, the lessee becomes the owner of the property after he acquires it. So there will be 
no more a lease. 
 
(4) By surrender:  A lease may come to an end by surrender. Surrender may be either express or 
implied. Express surrender arises when the lessee yields up his interst under a lease by mutual 
consent. Implied surrender occurs, as follows :- if during the subsistence of the lease, a new lease 
is granted to the tenant to commence at once in substitution for the existing lease, it operates as a 
surrender of the old lease. For example, a lessee, accepts to take effect during the continuance of 
the existing lease. This is an implied surrender of the former lease and such lease comes to an end. 
Similarly, when the landlord reserves possession without any objection on the tenant’s part, there is 
a surrender by implication. Mere non-payment of rent does not amount to surrender. 
 
(5) By forfeiture:  A lease also comes to an end by forfeiture. A forfeiture occurs when there is breach of 
a condition in a lease contract by the lessee. Under the Transfer of Property Act, forfeiture occurs in 
the following circumstances—the first case in which forfeiture occurs is the case when the lessee 
breaks an express condition which may be of various types such as, if the lessee does not pay the 
rent regularly, or if the lessee becomes insolvent, or where the lessee sublets the property to 
another person. In all such cases there will be a forfeiture. But the condition that the lessee breaks 
must be an express condition which must have been incorporated in the contract of lease. Then 
only the lessor can re-enter the leased property and claim that the lease shall be forfeited. 
In the case of a forfeiture due to default in payment of the rent, if the lessor sues the lessee to quit, the Court 
can direct the lessee to pay the rent or arrears of rent and continue the lease. But in a breach of any other 
condition, such as the breach of a condition preventing the lessee from subletting the property, the Court will 
not help the lessee if he breaks the condition. He will incur forfeiture. A breach of condition by the lessee 
gives an option to the lessor to bring the lease to an end. But if he does not exercise the option the lease will 
continue validly. The lessee, however, cannot on breaking the condition, take advantage of his wrong and 
terminate the lease. 
The second case of forfeiture occurs when the tenant denies the title of the landlord and claims that 
somebody else or he himself is the owner of the property. In order that a denial of the landlord’s title should 
work as a forfeiture of the lease, three things are necessary: 
 
(a) the tenant must set up title either in himself or in a third-party; 
 
(b) the denial must be direct and not casual; 
 
(c) it must be made known to the landlord. 
 (vii)  Duties of the Lessor:  Following are some of the duties of the lessor: 
EP-EBCL 
374 
 
(a) The lessor is bound to disclose to the lessee any material defect in the property with reference to its 
intended use of which the lessor is and the lessee is not aware. This rule applies only to physical 
defects of the property such as the condition and the nature of the property leased. You will note 
that the lessor is not bound to disclose whether or not he has title to the property. 
 
(b) The next duty of the lessor is to put the lessee in possession of the property. A lease is a transfer of 
possession the consideration being rent and, therefore, it follows that the landlord cannot recover 
the rent unless he has delivered possession to the tenant. If a contract of lease has been executed 
and the lessor does not give possession of the property to the lessee, the lessee can sue the lessor 
for possession. 
 
(c) The next duty that is cast on the lessor is what is usually called convenant for quiet enjoyment. The 
covenant, that is the right to undisturbed possession, so long as the lessee pays the rent, 
presupposes possession and, therefore, no action can be brought on this convenant unless the 
lessee has first obtained possession. The covenant for possession gives the lessee the right to 
obtain possession; the covenant for quiet enjoyment gives the lessee a right to continue in such 
possession. If the lessee’s possession is disturbed, he can sue for damages or, in case a part of the 
leased property is taken possession of either by the lessor or by any third-party; the lessee can hold 
a part of the leased property and pay a proportionate rent. 
(viii)  Duties of the lessee:  The lessee has the following duties: 
 
(a) The lessee is bound to disclose to the lessor any fact as to nature or extent of the interest that the 
lessee is about to take, of which the lessee is, and the lessor is not aware and which materially 
increases the value of such interest. 
 
(b) The lessee is bound to pay or tender at the proper time and place, the premium or rent to the lessor 
or his agent in this behalf. We have already seen that in case the lessee does not pay the rent, he 
may incur forfeiture of the tenancy. The liability to pay the rent commences from the date the tenant 
is put into possession. 
 
(c) The next duty of the lessee is that he uses the property as a person of ordinary prudence would 
make use of. But he shall not permit another person to use the property for purposes other than that 
for which it was leased. 
 
(d) He should not do any act which is destructive of or permanently injurious to the property. 
 
(e)  The lessee must not, without the lessor’s consent, erect on the property any permanent structure 
except for agricultural purpose. If he wants to erect certain fixtures or chattel on the leased property, 
it must be done without causing any damage to the property. Before the termination of the lease, he 
can remove all the things attached to the earth. If permanent fixtures are to be made, the lessee 
must obtain the consent of the landlord. 
 
(f) If the lessee comes to know of any proceedings by way of suit to recover the property of the lessor, 
the lessee should immediately inform the lessor. Since, the tenant is in possession of the property 
he is the person who is not likely to know of any encroachment on the landlord’s property and he 
should therefore inform the landlord. 
 
(g) The lessee should hand over the property at the end of the lease. 
(ix)  Rights of the lessee:  The lessee enjoys the following rights: 
 
(a) If during the continuance of the lease any accession is made to the property, such accession is 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
375 
deemed to be comprised in the lease, the lessee has a right to enjoy the accretions of the leased 
property. 
 
(b) Where, under the contract, the landlord has agreed to repair the property, the lessee can carry out 
the repairs and deduct the expenses from the rent if the landlord fails to do so. 
 
(c) If the lessee has made payment which the lessor is bound by law to pay such as payment of 
Government revenues or municipal taxes on the property, the lessee can deduct the amount from 
the rent and pay the balance to the lessor. He can even take interest on the amount he has paid. 
 
(d) The lessee has a right to remove the fixtures he has erected-during the term of the lease. 
 
(e) If, due to no fault of his, the lease comes to an end (i.e., when the lease is of uncertain duration), 
the lessee or his legal representatives are entitled to all the crops planted or grown by the lessee. 
The lessee or his representatives have got a right to come and carry away the crops, etc., which are 
growing on the land. If the lease is of a definite period, such a right cannot be claimed, particularly, 
when lessee has committed a fault, e.g., where he has committed a breach of a condition entailing 
forfeiture. 
 
(f) The lessee may avoid the lease, if property is wholly or partly destroyed by tempest, flood, or fire so 
as to make it impossible to continue the lease for the purpose for which it was let. 
 
(g) The lessee has right to transfer absolutely or by way of mortgage or sub-lease, the whole or any 
part of his interest in the property. We have also noticed that the lessee’s rights are transferable. 
 
5.  Actionable Claims 
"Actionable claim" has been dealt with under Sections 130 to 137 of the Act. 
 
(i) Definition: "Actionable claim" is defined in Section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act as follows: 
 
 A claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immoveable property or by 
hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in moveable property not 
in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the Civil courts recognize as 
affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing, 
conditional or contingent. 
Actionable claims are claims, to unsecured debts. If a debt is secured by the mortgage of immoveable 
property it is not an actionable claim, because the Section clearly excludes such a debt. A debt is a 
liquidated money obligation which is usually recoverable by a suit. To create a debt, first of all, there must be 
a liquidated or definite sum which is actually due. For example, arrears of rent due. The term debt may also 
include a sum of money which is due in the sense that it exists, but is not actually payable until a later date. 
For example, A borrows money from B on the 1st of January and promises to repay on March 15, the 
amount is not payable till the 15th of March, but certainly it is a debt and it is an accruing debt. Another 
essential of an actionable claim is that it is not in possession of a person and the person can claim such a 
debt by bringing an action in a Court of law. 
The Section also says that it must be a claim to any debt which the Civil Courts recognise as affording 
grounds for relief to the person who claims it. 
Illustrations of actionable claims: 
 
(i) Arrears of rent accrual constitute a ‘debt’ so it is an actionable claim (Sheu Gobind Singh v. Gauri 
Prasad, AIR 1925 Pat. 310). 
EP-EBCL 
376 
 
(ii) Provident Fund that is standing to the credit of a member of the Provident Fund. 
 
(iii) Money due under the Insurance Policy. 
 
(iv) A partner’s right to sue for accounts of dissolved partnership is an actionable claim being a 
beneficial interest in moveable property not in possession (Thakardas v. Vishindas). 
Non-actionable claims 
 
(i) Debentures are secured debts and therefore not regarded as actionable claims. 
 
(ii) Copy right though a beneficial interest in immoveable property is not an actionable claim 
since the owner has actual or constructive possession of the same (Savitri Devi v. Dwarka 
Bhatya, (1939) All 305). 
Again, an actionable claim includes a beneficial interest in the moveable property not in possession. Now, a 
benefit of a contract for the purchase of goods is a beneficial interest in moveable property. 
6.  Mortgages  
Sections 58 to 104 of the Act deal with "Mortgages". 
Definition and nature of mortgage:   
According to Section 58 of the Transfer of Property Act, a "mortgage" is the transfer of an interest in specific 
immoveable property for the purpose of securing the payment of money advanced or to be advanced by way 
of loan, an existing or future debt or the performance of an engagement which may give rise to pecuniary 
liability. 
The transferor is called a mortgagor, the transferee a mortgagee. The principal money and interest the 
payment of which is secured for the time being are called the mortgage money and the instrument by which 
the transfer is effected is called a mortgage deed. 
Essentials of a mortgage: 
 
(1) Transfer of interest:  The first thing to note is that a mortgage is a transfer of interest in the specific 
immoveable property. The mortgagor as an owner of the property is possessed of all the interests in 
it, and when he mortgages the property to secure a loan, he only parts with an interest in that 
property in favour of the mortgagor. After mortgage, the interest of the mortgagor is reduced by the 
interest which has been transferred to the mortgagee. His ownership has become less for the time 
being by the interest which he has parted with in favour of the mortgagee. If the mortgagor transfers 
this property, the transferee gets it subject to the right of the mortgagor to recover from it what is 
due to him, i.e., the principal plus interest. 
 
(2) Specific immoveable property:  The second point is that the property must be specifically mentioned 
in the mortgage deed. Where, for instance, the mortgagor stated “all of my property” in the 
mortgage deed, it was held by the Court that this was not a mortgage. The reason why the 
immoveable property must be distinctly and specifically mentioned in the mortgage deed is that, in 
case the mortgagor fails to repay the loan the Court is in a position to grant a decree for the sale of 
any particular property in a suit by the mortgagee. 
 
(3) To secure the payment of a loan:  Another characteristic of a mortgage is that the transaction is for 
the purpose of securing the payment of a loan for the performance of an obligation which may give 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
377 
rise to pecuniary liability. It may be for the purpose of obtaining a loan, or if a loan has already been 
granted to secure the repayment of such loan. There is thus a debt and the relationship between the 
mortgagor and the mortgagee is that of debtor and creditor. When A borrows 100 bags of paddy 
and further quantity by way of interest, it is mortgage transaction for the performance of an 
obligation. 
Where, however, a person borrows money and agrees with the creditor that till the debt is repaid he will not 
alienate his property, the transaction does not amount to a mortgage. Here the person merely says that he 
will not transfer his property till he has repaid the debt; he does not transfer any interest in the property to the 
creditor. In sale as distinguished from a mortgage, all the interest or rights of ownership are transferred to the 
purchaser. In a mortgage, as stated earlier, only part of the interests are transferred to the mortgagee, some 
of them remaining vested in the mortgagor. 
  
To sum up, it may be stated that there are three outstanding characteristics of a mortgage: 
(a) the mortgagee’s interest in the property mortgaged terminates upon the performance of 
the obligation secured by the Mortgage. 
 
(b) the mortgagor has a right of foreclosure upon the mortgagor’s failure to perform. 
 
(c) the mortgagor has a right to redeem or regain the property on repayment of the debt or performance 
of the obligation. 
 
Form of a mortgage contract:   
According to Section 59, where the principal money secured is Rs. 100 or upwards, a mortgage, other than a 
mortgage by deposit of title-deeds, can be effected only by a registered instrument or by delivery of property. 
It should be noted that a mortgage is not a mere contract but it is the Conveyance of Interest in the 
mortgaged property and as soon as the mortgage deed is registered an interest in the property vests in the 
mortgagee. 
Kinds of mortgages:  
 There are in all six kinds of mortgages in immoveable property, namely 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Simple mortgage 
Anomalous 
mortgage 
Mortgage by 
deposit of title 
deeds or equitable 
mortgage 
Mortgage 
by 
conditional sale 
Usufractuary 
mortgage 
English mortgage 
EP-EBCL 
378 
(a)  Simple mortgage 
In a simple mortgage, the mortgagor binds himself personally to pay the debt and agrees in the event of his 
failure to pay the mortgage money, the mortgagee shall have the right to cause the property to be applied so 
far as may be necessary by means of a decree for the sale of property. If the mortgaged property is not 
sufficient to discharge the debt, the mortgagee can bring a personal action against the mortgagor and obtain 
a decree which, like any other money decree, can be executed against other properties of the mortgagor. In 
simple mortgage, no right of possession or foreclosure is available to the mortgagee. 
(b)  Mortgage by conditional sale 
In this type of mortgage, the property is mortgaged with a condition super added that in the event of a failure 
by the debtor to repay the debt at the stipulated time, the transaction should be regarded a sale, and in case 
the loan is repaid at the stipulated time, the sale shall be invalid, or on condition that on such payment being 
made the buyer shall transfer the property to the seller. 
Thus, for all practical purposes, this type of mortgage is ostensible sale of the mortgaged property with a 
condition for re-purchase by the mortgagor by repaying the loan. It will be noted that the mortgagor transfers 
the property with the following three conditions: 
 
(a) If the loan is repaid, the sale becomes void. 
 
(b) If the loan is not repaid at the stipulated time, the sale will become absolute and binding. 
 
(c) When the debt has been repaid at the stipulated time, the mortgagee shall re-transfer the property 
to the mortgagor. 
 
 In case of mortgage by conditional sale, there is no personal covenant. That is unlike in the case of 
a simple mortgage, the mortgagor in this case does not bind himself personally to repay the debt. 
The mortgagee is not given the possession of the property in this type of mortgage. This is also the 
position in the case of a simple mortgage. Again, in a mortgage by conditional sale, the mortgagee’s 
remedy is ‘foreclosure’, that is he becomes the owner of the property in default of payment of the 
debt by the mortgagor, he has to institute a regular suit in a Court of law to "foreclose" the 
mortgage. To "foreclose" means to debar the mortgagor from redeeming the property forever. 
(c)  Usufructuary mortgage 
Section 58(d) defines a "usufructuary mortgage" as “where the mortgagor delivers possession or expressly 
or by implication binds himself to deliver possession of the mortgaged property to the mortgagee, and 
authorises him to retain such possession until payment of the mortgage money, and to receive the rents and 
profits accruing from the property or any part of such rents and profits and to appropriate the same in lieu of 
interest, or in payment of the mortgage money, or partly in lieu of interest or partly in payment of the 
mortgage money, the transaction is called an usufractuary mortgage. It is also called a mortgage with 
possession. 
Thus is this type of mortgage the mortgagor has to deliver possession of the property to the mortgagee. If the 
possession is not given, the mortgagee can sue for possession. The mere fact that possession has not been 
delivered will not alter the nature of the transaction. In Pratap Bahadur v. Gajadhar, 24 All 521, it was agreed 
that the mortgagee will put the mortgagor in possession of a village on a certain date and to pay interest till 
possession was delivered. It was held that mortgage was an usufructuary mortgage. The mortgagee is 
authorised to retain possession and receive rents, etc., until he recovers the whole debt and the interest. The 
usufructuary mortgagee has to look only to the profits that arise out of the property for realising his debt; 
there is no personal liability on the part of the mortgagor. Similarly, the mortgagee has no right to foreclose 
the mortgage or to sue for sale. 
A mortgage may be regarded as usufructuary even though the entire debt is not to be paid out of the profits 
of the property. Therefore, a usufructuary mortgage may be either (i) where the entire mortgage money is to 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
379 
be paid from the profit of the land; or (ii) where only part of the mortgage money is principal or interest 
amount is to be paid from the profit of the land. 
If in a usufructuary mortgage a time is mentioned during which the mortgagee should recover the debt, etc., 
then after the time is over, the mortgagee should deliver back the property to the mortgagor. He cannot 
refuse to give back the property, if he has not been able to recover the debt and the interest, etc. A 
usufructuary mortgagee is supposed to remain in possession of the mortgaged property and manage the 
same as a person of ordinary prudence would manage subject to the conditions of mortgage agreement. Any 
loss due to failure on his part would be debited to his account (Panchanan Sharma v. B.P. Jagnani, SCALE 
1995 (2) 641). 
Thus, a usufructuary mortgage has the following characteristics: 
 
1. Possession of property must be delivered to the mortgagee; 
 
2. There is no personal liability on the part of the mortgagor to pay; 
 
3. The mortgagee is entitled to rents and profits in lieu of interest or principal or both; and 
 
4. The mortgagee however is not entitled to foreclose the mortgagee or to sue for sale. 
(d)  English mortgage 
Section 58(e) states that: “where the mortgagor binds himself to repay the mortgage money on a certain 
date, and transfers the mortgaged property absolutely to the mortgagee but subject to a proviso that he will 
retransfer it to the mortgagor upon payment of the money as agreed, the transaction is called an English 
mortgage”. 
Here the mortgagor transfers the ownership of the property as security and the mortgagee promises to re-
transfer the ownership, if the money is paid within a definite time. There is also a personal covenant as the 
mortgagor promises to repay within a certain date. In this type of mortgage, there is proviso that if money is 
repaid the property would be reconveyed. The remedy of the mortgagee is sale of the property to recover the 
debt. Thus, the essential features of an English mortgage are as under: 
 
1. The mortgagor binds himself to repay the mortgage money on a certain day. In other words, there 
should be a personal undertaking to pay. 
 
2. The mortgaged property is absolutely transferred to the mortgagee. 
 
3. Such absolute transfer is subject to a proviso that the mortgagee will reconvey the property to the 
mortgagor upon payment by him of the mortgage money on the fixed day. 
Distinction between English mortgage and mortgage by conditional sale 
An English mortgage looks like a mortgage by conditional sale but there are obvious differences between the 
two: 
 
1. In English mortgage there is a personal liability undertaken by the mortgagor to pay the debt. In a 
mortgage by conditional sale there is no personal covenant (agreement for payment of the 
mortgage money and mortgagee has his remedy against the mortgaged property only; 
 
2. In English mortgage the ownership in the mortgaged property is absolutely transferred to the creditor 
(i.e. mortgagee) which however, may be divested on repayment of the loan on the fixed day. 
In a mortgage by conditional sale, the mortgagee gets only a qualified ownership which may, however, ripen 
into an absolute ownership in default of payment of the mortgage money. 
 (e)  Mortgage by deposit of title deeds 
This type of mortgage is called equitable mortgage in English law. In this transaction, a person delivers to the 
EP-EBCL 
380 
creditor or his agent documents of title of his immoveable property with an intention to create a security, and 
obtains a loan. The requisites of such a mortgage are (i) a debt, (ii) deposit of title deeds, and (iii) an 
intention that the deeds shall be security for the debt. 
In order that a valid mortgage on an immoveable property should be effected, it must be in writing and 
attested by two witnesses and the document must be registered. But in case of a mortgage by deposit of title 
deeds, it need not be registered and an oral agreement between the person and the creditor followed by the 
delivery of the documents of title to the property is enough. The creditor will have the possession of the 
documents and he will advance the money at the stipulated rate of interest. In case the mortgagor does not 
repay the loan, the creditor on the basis of having the title deeds in his possession can sue the debtor to 
recover the money. This type of mortgage has been recognized due to expediency. Many persons, specially 
the business people, may need money urgently and they cannot wait till a formal document is written, signed, 
attested and then registered. So they will simply approach the creditor and hand over the title deeds of their 
property and borrow money. This avoids delay and other formalities for effecting a valid mortgage. 
There must be a clear intention on the part of the person who hands over the title deeds to effect a valid 
mortgage. In the absence of any intention, the mere holding in possession of the title deeds will not create a 
valid mortgage. 
The term ‘documents of title’ or title deeds means such documents as will show prima facie or apparent title 
to the property of the person who is borrowing money. Accordingly, in one case it was held that tax receipt 
was not a document of title to the property on which the tax was paid. What is necessary to deposit is a 
document which gives him his right to the property and the creditor should insist on the production of this 
document before he gives money on a pledge of documents. 
It should be noted that this type of mortgage can be created only in certain towns and not everywhere in 
India. The facility to create a valid mortgage is available in the following towns in India: Calcutta, Madras, 
Bombay, Adoni, Ajmer, Allahabad, Alwar, Bangalore, Bellary, Cochin, Coimbatore, Delhi, Jaipur, Jodhpur, 
Kanpur, Rajahmundry, Udaipur, Vellor, Ellora, Pali, Bhilwara, Bikaner, Kakinada, Narayanganj, Mysore, and 
Madurai. Though this type of mortgage is limited to specific cities it is at par with any other legal mortgage 
(K.J. Nathan v. S.V. Maruthi Rao, A.I.R. 1965 S.C. 443). 
Title deeds should be delivered in these areas, the property of the person may be situated elsewhere. If the 
deposit of title deeds has taken place in any other town, it will not be a valid mortgage. Similarly, if the 
property is situated in any one of the towns mentioned above, but the deposit of title deeds is made in other 
towns or areas then again it will not be a valid mortgage. 
(f)  Anomalous mortgage 
Section 58(g) of the Transfer of Property Act provides that “a mortgage which is not a simple mortgage, a 
mortgage by conditional sale, usufructuary mortgage, an English mortgage, or a mortgage by deposit of title 
deeds within the meaning of this section is called an anomalous mortgage”. 
Thus, an anomalous mortgage is a combination of various other mortgages, for example, a usufructuary 
mortgage may be created and the mortgagee shall have the right of sale. You have already noticed that in a 
usufructuary mortgage only possession is given to the mortgagee and there is no right of sale. But in an 
anomalous mortgage the right of sale along with the possession of the property may be given. You have also 
seen that in the case of usufructuary mortgage, there is no personal liability on the part of a mortgagor but if 
the mortgagor assumes personal liability to pay the mortgage money, it will be an anomalous mortgage. 
Again, a mortgagee may be given possession of the property for a fixed period with a condition that in case 
the debt is not discharged at the expiry of the period mentioned, the mortgage shall be regarded as a 
mortgage by conditional sale. In this case, the mortgage has got a right of "foreclosure" and after the expiry 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
381 
of the period if the debt is not paid, the mortgagee will become the owner of the property. 
Two other terms in common use in connection with mortgage may be considered here. These terms are (i) 
Sub-mortgage; and (ii) Puisne mortgage. 
Sub-mortgage:  
Where the mortgagee transfers by mortgage his interest in the mortgaged property, or creates a mortgage of 
a mortgage the transaction is known as a sub-mortgage. For example, where A mortgages his house to B for 
Rs. 10,000 and B mortgage his mortgagee right to C for Rs. 8,000. B creates a sub-mortgage. 
Puisne mortgage:  
Where the mortgagor, having mortgaged his property, mortgages it to another person to secure another loan, 
the second mortgage is called a puisne mortgage. For example, where A mortgages his house worth ` one 
lakh to B for `40,000 and mortgages the same house to C for a further sum of `30,000, the mortgage to B is 
first mortgage and that to C the second or puisne mortgage. C is the puisne mortgagee, and can recover the 
debt subject to the right of B, the first mortgagee, to recover his debt of `40,000 plus interest. 
Rights of mortgagor:   
By mortgaging the property the mortgagor does not cease to be its owner, he only transfers an interest in it. 
The law, therefore, grants him the following rights: 
 
(a) Right of redemption:  The first and the most important right of the mortgagor is the right to redeem 
i.e., take back the mortgaged property by paying the mortgage money at any time after the 
stipulated date for repayment. Section 60 of the Act provides that any time after the principal 
amount has become due, the mortgagor has a right to redeem the property. Although the Act gives 
him the right to redeem “any time” after their debt has become due, it enjoins upon the mortgagor 
the obligation to exercise this right (i) before the right is extinguished by the Act of parties or by a 
decree of Court, or (ii) before it is barred by the Limitation Act. According to the Law of Limitation 
the, mortgagor can redeem the property within 60 years after the money has become due. This right 
to redeem the property even after the time of payment has elapsed is called the Right of Equity or 
Redemption. But the mortgagor is not entitled to redeem before the mortgage money becomes due 
on the date fixed for repayment of the loan. His right to redeem arises only when mortgage money 
becomes due and not before. 
 
(b) Right against clog on equity of redemption: Right of redemption or equity of redemption is the essence 
of a mortgage, and any provision inserted in the mortgage deed to prevent, evade or hamper 
redemption is void. Any condition which prevents the mortgagor from redeeming the property is called 
a “clog” on the equity or right of redemption and is void. The rule of equity that once a mortgage 
always a mortgage prohibits a clog on the right of redemption. In other words, once a transaction is 
found to be a mortgage, the Court would not permit any condition in a mortgage deed which would 
prevent or impede redemption or repayment of the loan for which the security was given.  
 
(c) Right of partial redemption: A mortgage, as a rule, being one and indivisible for the debt and every 
part of it, the mortgagor cannot redeem piecemeal; he must redeem the whole property. But Section 
61 of the Act gives a right of partial redemption stating that “a mortgagor who has executed two or 
more mortgages in favour of the same mortgagee shall, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, 
when the principal money of any two or more of the mortgages has become due, be entitled to 
redeem any one such mortgage separately or any two or more of such mortgages together.” 
Implied contract by mortgagor: 
The parties are free to enter into any terms they like. Where, however, the contract does not contain all the 
EP-EBCL

terms, Section 65 provides for implied terms as follows: 
In the absence of a contract to the contrary, the mortgagor shall be deemed to have contracted with the 
mortgagee that the: 
 
(a) mortgagor is entitled to transfer the interest (covenant for title); 
 
(b) mortgagor will assist the mortgagee to enjoy quiet possession; 
 
(c) mortgagor will pay public charges in respect of the mortgaged property; 
 
(d) mortgagor covenants as to payment of the rent due on lease where, the mortgaged property is 
leased; 
 
(e) mortgagor covenants as to payment of interest and principal on prior encumbrances, where the 
mortgage is a second or subsequent encumbrance on the property. 
Rights of mortgagee and his remedies:   
If the mortgagor does not pay the mortgage money, the mortgagee may proceed to recover (i) from the 
mortgaged property, or (ii) sue for recovery from the mortgagor personally. Thus the mortgagor has two 
remedies: one against the property and the other against the mortgagor personally. 
7.  Charges 
Meaning of charge:  "Charge" has been defined under Section 100 as follows:  “Where immoveable property 
of one person is by the act of parties or operation of law made security for the payment of money to another, 
and the transaction does not amount to a mortgage, the latter person is said to have a charge on the 
property”. 
As is evident from the above definition, a charge comes into existence either by the act of parties or by 
operation of law. 
Charge by act of parties:  When in a transaction for value, both the parties (debtor and creditor) intend that 
the property existing or future shall be made available as security for the payment of a debt and that the 
creditor shall have a present right to have it made available, there is a charge. 
Charge by Operation of Law: Charges created by law are those which arise on account of some statutory 
provisions. They are not created by the voluntary action of parties but arise as a result of some legal 
obligation. 
Floating charge: A charge may be floating as well as fixed. A fixed charge is a charge on specific property 
but a floating charge is an equitable charge on the assets for time being of a going concern. It is peculiar to 
companies which are able to borrow money without any interference with their assets so long as they are 
going concern. In other words, it is a charge on a class of the assets of the company, present as well as 
future. The assets of the company are constantly undergoing a change but the creditors will not normally 
interfere with the assets of the company unless there is breach of some condition. As Professor Gower says, 
the assets are liquid and the charge is floating. It is ambulatory and shifting in its nature hovering over and so 
to speak floating with the property which it is intended to effect. As it does not attach to any specific property, 
it remains document until it crystallises. 
A floating charge has the following characteristics: 
 
1. It is a charge on class of assets both present and future. 
 
2. The class of assets charged is one which in the ordinary course of business would be changing 
from time to time. 
 
3. It is contemplated by the charge that until some future step is taken by those who are interested in 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
383 
the charge the company may carry on its business in the ordinary way, i.e., it may use its assets 
charged in the ordinary course of its business. (Per Roman L.J. in Reyork Shive Wool Combers 
Associated Limited, (1903) 2 Ch. 284) A floating charge is created by debentures on the company’s 
undertaking or its estate, property and effects. It is not necessary that the charge should be on all 
company’s assets. Thus a mortgage of a cinema and of the chattels used in the cinema premises 
was held to be a floating charge as to the chattles (National Provisional Bank of England Limited v. 
Charteb Electric Theatres Limited, (1916) Ch. 132). Similarly, a floating charge was created by a 
mortgage of book and other debts which shall become due during the continuance of this security 
(Reyork Shive Wool Combers Association, Supra). 
Crystallisation of floating charge 
A floating charge becomes fixed or crystallises in the following cases: 
 
1. When the money becomes payable under a condition in the debenture and the debenture holder, 
(i.e., the creditor) takes some steps to enforce the security; 
 
2. When the company ceases to carry on business; and 
 
3. When the company is being wound-up. 
  
8.  Distinction between Mortgage and Charge 
Although in a charge, the property is made a security for the payment of the loan, yet the transaction does 
not amount to mortgage. It is important, therefore to distinguish between a charge and mortgage. 
 
(a) A mortgage is transfer of an interest in the property made by the mortgagor as a security for the 
loan, while the charge is not the transfer of any interest in the property though it is security for the 
payment of an amount. 
 
(b) A charge may be created by act of parties or by operation of law. A mortgage can only be created 
by act of parties. 
 
(c) A mortgage deed must be registered and attested by two witnesses, while a charge need not be 
made in writing, and if reduced to writing, it need not be attested or registered. 
 
(d) In certain types of mortgage (viz., mortgage by conditional sale and anomalous mortgage) the 
mortgagor can foreclose the mortgaged property but in charge, the charge-holder cannot foreclose 
though he can get the property sold as in a simple mortgage. 
 
(e) From the very nature of it, a charge as a general rule, cannot be enforced against a transferee for 
consideration without notice. But in a mortgage, the transferee of mortgaged property from the mortgagor, 
can only acquire the remaining interest of the mortgagor, and is therefore, only bound by the mortgage. 
 
(f) In a charge created by act of parties the specification of the particular fund or property negatives a 
personal liability and the remedy of the charge-holder is against the property only. In a mortgage, 
there can be security as well as personal liability. In fact, the absence of a personal liability is the 
principal test that distinguishes a charge from a simple mortgage. 
 
LESSON ROUND-UP 
• The law relating to transfer of property is governed by the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. ‘Transfer of 
Property’ means an act by which a living person conveys property, in present or future, to one or more 
EP-EBCL 
384 
other living persons, or to himself, and one or more other living persons. ‘living person’ includes a company 
or association or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not. 
• Every person who is competent to contract and entitled to transferable property, or authorized to dispose of 
property is competent to transfer such property. Property can be transferred either orally or by writing. 
Moveable property can be transferred by delivery of possession or by registration. In the case of tangible 
immoveable property of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards, or in the case of a reversion or 
other intangible thing, transfer can be made only by a registered instrument. In the case of tangible 
immoveable property of a value less than one hundred rupees, such transfer may be made either by a 
registered instrument or by delivery of the property. 
• When property is transferred, the transferee should not be restrained absolutely from alienating the 
property. One may give property to another subject to a condition, but the condition should not be one 
which absolutely prevents the transferee from alienating the property. A transfer may also be made subject 
to a contingency which may or may not occur. This is known as condition subsequent. Condition 
subsequent is one which destroys or divests the rights upon the happening or non-happening of an event.  
• Section 35 of the Transfer of Property Act deals with what is called doctrine of election. Election may be 
defined as “the choosing between two rights where there is a clear intention that both were not intended to 
be enjoyed”. The foundation of doctrine of election is that a person taking the benefit of an instrument must 
also bear the burden, and he must not take under and against the same instrument. 
• Where, with the consent, express of implied, of the persons interested in immoveable property, a person is 
the ostensible owner of such property and transfers the same for consideration, the transfer shall not be 
voidable on the ground that the transferor was not authorized to make it, provided that the transferee, after 
taking reasonable care to ascertain that the transferor had power to make the transfer, has acted in good 
faith. This is called doctrine of Holding Out. 
• Doctrine of Feeding the Grant by Estoppel means where, a person fraudulently or erroneously represents 
that he is authorized to transfer certain immoveable property and professes to transfer such property for 
consideration, such transfer shall, at the option of the transferee, operate on any interest which the 
transferor may acquire in such property at any time during which the contract of transfer subsists. 
• Where a person transfers his property so that his creditors shall not have anything out of the property, the 
transfer is called a fraudulent transfer. A debtor in order to defeat or delay the rights of a creditor, may 
transfer his property to some person, who may be his relative or a friend. The law does not allow this. 
• The Act does not allow accumulation of income from the land for an unlimited period without the income-
being enjoyed by owner of the property. The law allows accumulation of income for a certain period only. 
The period for which such accumulation is valid is : (a) the life of the transferor, or (b) eighteen years from 
the date of transfer. Any direction to accumulate the income beyond the period mentioned above is void. 
However, this is subject to certain exceptions. 
• Lis pendens means a pending suit, action, petition or the like. Section 52 of the T.P. Act incorporates the 
doctrine of Lis pendens. It states that during the pendency of a suit in a court of law, property which is 
subject to a litigation cannot be transferred. 
• The Act expressly provides for special types of transfers such as sale, exchange, gift, mortgage and lease. 
In a sale, exchange and gift, there is a transfer of the ownership of property but mortgage is a transfer of an 
interest in specific immovable property and lease is a transfer of the right to enjoy immoveable property. 
• Actionable claims are claims, to unsecured debts. If a debt is secured by the mortgage of immoveable 
                                                                         Lesson 16        Law Relating to Transfer of Property 
385 
property it is not an actionable claim, because the section clearly excludes such a debt. 
• Charge under the Act has been defined as “where immoveable property of one person is by the act of 
parties or operation of law made security for the payment of money to another, and the transaction does not 
amount to a mortgage, the latter person is said to have a charge on the property”. 
• As is evident from the above definition, a charge comes into existence either by the act of parties or by 
operation of law. A charge may be floating as well as fixed. A fixed charge is a charge on specific property 
but a floating charge is an equitable charge on the assets for time being of a going concern. It is peculiar to 
companies which are able to borrow money without any interference with their assets so long as they are 
going concerns.

INTRODUCTION 
Real estate sector plays a catalytic role in fulfilling the needs and demand for housing and infrastructure in 
the country and is an important pillar of the economy. While this sector has grown significantly in recent 
years, it has been largely unregulated, with absence of professionalism and standardisation and lack of 
adequate consumer protection. It has no sectoral regulator like there are for other specific sectors like 
insurance, telecom, stock markets etc. History is witness to the fact that whenever sectoral regulators like 
SEBI, IRDAI, TRAI etc have been formed, they have helped in deepening the market and made it more 
robust. Though the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is available as a forum to the buyers in the real estate 
market, the recourse is only curative and is not adequate to address all the concerns of buyers and 
promoters in that sector. The lack of standardisation has been a constraint to the healthy and orderly growth 
of industry. Therefore, since more than a decade the need for regulating the sector was being emphasised in 
various forums. 
In view of the above, Parliament enacted the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 which 
aims at protecting the rights and interests of consumers and promotion of uniformity and standardization of 
business practices and transactions in the real estate sector. It attempts to balance the interests of 
consumers and promoters by imposing certain responsibilities on both. It seeks to establish symmetry of 
information between the promoter and purchaser, transparency of contractual conditions, set minimum 
standards of accountability and a fast-track dispute resolution mechanism. 
This Act will be put in operation just like the Motor Vehicles Act passed by the Central Government, pursuant 
to which respective State Governments (“SG”) and Union Territories (‘UT”) are required to notify their own 
Rules, which would be in the lines of the Central Act and accordingly administer their own State Rules. 
Accordingly, every SG and UT are to required to promulgate their own Real Estate Rules which would be 
based on the lines of the central Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act 2016, and establish a Real 
Estate Regulatory Authority (“RERA”) pursuant to the Rules, which will administer the respective Real Estate 
Rules of the State or UT. State Governements and UTs were required to notify and enforce RERA by 1st 
May 2017, which was the deadline set by the the Central Government. But a few State Governements have 
missed the deadline of 1st May 2017. It is expected that most of the State Governments would meet the 
second deadline of 31st July 2017, by which the ongoing projects are to be registered with RERA. 
The objects and reasons for which the Act has been framed are:

REGISTRATION OF REAL ESTATE PROJECT AND REGISTRATION OF REAL ESTATE 
AGENTS 
Many developers across India follow a common practice of pre-lauching a project without securing requisite 
approvals for the project from the local authorities, which is termed as “soft launch”, “pre-launch” etc. Buyers 
also lap into this opportunity as they get discounted prices during the pre-launches period. But if it is from a 
developer who is unscrupulous or a fly by night operator, then it carries a great risk. Hence, to plug this gap, 
registration of every project with the regulatory authority has been mandatory before it is launched for sale 
and for registration the basic pre-requisite is that the developer must have all the requisite approvals. Thus 
the buyer is protected as the project is ring-fenced from the vagaries of non-approvals or delays in approvals 
which are one of the major causes of delay for the project. The gist of relevant provisions for registration as 
ascribed in sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Act are stated below: 
Prior Registration of Real Estate project with Real Estate Regulatory Authority 
A promoter shall not advertise, market, book, sell or offer for sale, or invite persons to purchase in any 
EP-EBCL 
396 
manner any plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, in any real estate project or part of it, in any 
planning area, without registering the real estate project with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority 
established. 
The projects that are ongoing on the date of commencement of this Act and for which the completion 
certificate has not been issued, the promoter shall make an application to the Authority for registration of the 
said project within a period of three months from the date of commencement of this Act. 
Authority in the interest of allottees, for projects which are developed beyond the planning area but with the 
requisite permission of the local authority, it may, by order, direct the promoter of such project to register with 
the Authority, and the provisions of this Act or the rules and regulations made there under, shall apply to 
such projects from that stage of registration where the real estate project is to be developed in phases, every 
such phase shall be considered a stand alone real estate project, and the promoter shall obtain registration 
under this Act for each phase separately. 
Projects exempt from the ambit of the Act 
The following projects do not require to be registered under the Act: 
 
1. Area of land does not exceed 500 Sq. Meters

commencement of this Act;

concerned with the development of the proposed project; 
 
(l) a declaration, supported by an affidavit, which shall be signed by the promoter or any person 
authorised by the promoter, stating:— 
 
(A) that he has a legal title to the land on which the development is proposed along with legally 
valid documents with authentication of such title, if such land is owned by another person; 
 
(B) that the land is free from all encumbrances, or as the case may be details of the encumbrances

The promoter shall withdraw the amounts from the separate account, to cover the cost of the project, in 
proportion to the percentage of completion of the project. The amounts from the separate account shall be 
withdrawn by the promoter after it is certified by an engineer, an architect and a chartered accountant in

such other documents as may be prescribed by the rules or regulations made under. 
The Authority shall operationalise a web based online system for submitting applications for registration of 
projects within a period of one year from the date of its establishment. 
Granting of Registration by the Authority 
On receipt of the application, the Authority shall within a period of thirty days- 
 
(a) grant registration subject to the provisions of the Act and the rules and regulations made 
thereunder. A registration number, including a Login Id and password to the applicant for accessing 
the website of the Authority and to create his web page and to fill therein the details of the proposed 
project; or 
 
(b) reject the application for reasons to be recorded in writing, if such application does not conform to 
the provisions of this Act or the rules or regulations made thereunder.Application shall not be 
rejected unless the applicant has been given an opportunity of being heard in the matter. 
If the Authority fails to grant the registration or reject the application, as the case may be, the project shall be 
deemed to have been registered, and the Authority shall within a period of seven days of the expiry of the 
said period of thirty days specified. 
The registration granted shall be valid for a period declared by the promoter for completion of the project or 
phase thereof, as the case may be. 
Extension of registration 
Delay in handing over of projects by the developer within the stipulated time frame has been a major woe of 
the buyers and hence has been a major trigger for promulgation of this Act. Hence, at the time of registration, 
a developer has to specify a time line during which he will complete and handover the project to the buyer. 
The timeline is very sacrosanct because if he fails to do so within the stated time, then there are rigorous 
provisions in the Act as prescribed in section 7 & 8 whereby his registration would be revoked and his project 
would be usurped by the Regulator. Though as per section 6, an extension of registration may be granted at 
the sole discretion of the regulator due to Force Majeure conditions or if there are reasonable circumstances 
which merit extension. 
The registration granted may be extended by the Authority on an application made by the promoter due to 
force majeure, in such form and on payment of such fee as may be specified by regulations made by the 
Authority. 
"Force majeure" shall mean a case of war, flood, drought, fire, cyclone, earthquake or any other calamity 
caused by nature affecting the regular development of the real estate project. 
The Authority may in reasonable circumstances, without default on the part of the promoter, based on the 
facts of each case, and for reasons to be recorded in writing, extend the registration granted to a project for 
such time as it considers necessary, which shall, in aggregate, not exceed a period of one year. 
Application for extension of registration shall not be rejected unless the applicant has been given an 
opportunity of being heard in the matter. 
                                                                 Lesson 17        Real Estate (Regulation & Development) Act, 2016 
399 
Revocation of registration 
The Authority may, on receipt of a complaint or suomotu in this behalf or on the recommendation of the 
competent authority, revoke the registration granted, after being satisfied that— 
 
(a) the promoter makes default in doing anything required by or under this Act or the rules or the 
regulations made there under; 
 
(b) the promoter violates any of the terms or conditions of the approval given by the competent 
authority; 
 
(c) the promoter is involved in any kind of unfair practice or irregularities. 
The term "unfair practice means" a practice which, for the purpose of promoting the sale or development of 
any real estate project adopts any unfair method or unfair or deceptive practice including any of the following 
practices, namely:— 
 
A. the practice of making any statement, whether in writing or by visible representation which,— 
 
(i) falsely represents that the services are of a particular standard or grade; 
 
(ii) represents that the promoter has approval or affiliation which such promoter does not have; 
 
(iii) makes a false or misleading representation concerning the services;

or otherwise of services that are not intended to be offered;

the proposed revocation. 
The Authority may, instead of revoking the registration, permit it to remain in force subject to such further 
terms and conditions as it thinks fit to impose in the interest of the allottees, and any such terms and 
conditions so imposed shall be binding upon the promoter. 
The Authority, upon the revocation of the registration-

list of defaulters and display his photograph on its website and also inform the other Real Estate 
Regulatory Authority in other States and Union territories about such revocation or registration;

provided under the provisions of the Act: 
In case of revocation of registration of a project under the Act, the association of allottees shall have the first 
right of refusal for carrying out of the remaining development works. 
Registration of real estate agents 
Real estate broking is one of the easiest business in India as there are no specific qualification or experience 
requirements and also there is no code of practice which sets accountability, transparency and professional 
benchmarks. Hence, there are thousands of non-professional agents/ brokers in every city operating without 
any accountability. Hence, to bring in transparency and accountability, agents have also been covered under 
the ambit of RERA and registration requirement has been mandatory for them as per section 9 of the Act. 
Without obtaining registration, real estate agent shall not facilitate the sale or purchase of or act on behalf of 
any person to facilitate the sale or purchase of any plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, in a real 
estate project or part of it, being the part of the real estate project registered, being sold by the promoter in 
any planning area. 
Every real estate agent shall make an application to the Authority for registration in such form, manner, 
within such time and accompanied by such fee and documents as may be prescribed. 
The Authority shall, within such period, in such manner and upon satisfying itself of the fulfilment of such 
conditions, as may be prescribed— 
 
(a) grant a single registration to the real estate agent for the entire State of Union territory, as the case 
may be; 
 
(b) reject the application for reasons to be recorded in writing, if such application does not conform to 
the provisions of the Act or the rules or regulations made there under: 
Application shall not be rejected unless the applicant has been given an opportunity of being heard in the 
matter. 
Whereon the completion of the period prescribed under the act, if the applicant does not receive any 
communication about the deficiencies in his application or the rejection of his application, he shall be 
deemed to have been registered. 
Every real estate agent who is registered as per the provisions of this Act or the rules and regulations made 
there under, shall be granted a registration number by the Authority, which shall be quoted by the real estate 
agent in every sale facilitated by him under this Act. 
Every registration shall be valid for such period as may be prescribed, and shall be renewable for a period in 
such manner and on payment of such fee as may be prescribed. 
Where any real estate agent who has been granted registration under this Act commits breach of any of the 
conditions thereof or any other terms and conditions specified under this Act or any rules or regulations 
made there under, or where the Authority is satisfied that such registration has been secured by the real 
estate agent through misrepresentation or fraud, the Authority may, without prejudice to any other provisions 
                                                                 Lesson 17        Real Estate (Regulation & Development) Act, 2016 
401 
under this Act, revoke the registration or suspend the same for such period as it thinks fit: 
Provided that no such revocation or suspension shall be made by the Authority unless an opportunity of 
being heard has been given to the real estate agent. 
Functions of real estate agents 
Every real estate agent which is not registered with the Authority shall not facilitate the sale or purchase of 
any plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, in a real estate project or part of it, being sold by the 
promoter in any planning area. So, firstly they require to register themselves with the authority.

prescribed. 
Every real estate agent not to involve himself in any unfair trade practices, namely:— 
 
(i) the practice of making any statement, whether orally or in writing or by visible representation

▪ represents that the promoter or himself has approval or affiliation which such promoter or 
himself does not have; 
 
▪ makes a false or misleading representation concerning the services; 
 
(ii) permitting the publication of any advertisement whether in any newspaper or otherwise of services 
that are not intended to be offered. 
Every real estate agent shall facilitate the possession of all the information and documents, as the allottee, is

other functions as may be prescribed.

THE REAL ESTATE REGULATORY AUTHORITY 
As stated earlier, though this sector has seen unprecedented growth since Independence, it has remained 
unregulated till know. We have witnessed that whenever a regulator is appointed for a sector, like SEBI, 
IRDAI, TRAI etc, it widens the sectors. Accordingly, this act mandates that RERA would be established by 
each of the State and UT for administering the real estate sector in the respective State/UT. A state can have 
more than one RERA or two states can have the same authority. All States and UTs were to appoint RERA 
by 1st May 2017 but few States have missed the deadline but it is expected that they will appoint RERA in 
their respective states by 31st July 2017 as it is the last date by which the ongoing projects have to 
registered by the developer with RERA.

India is witnessing a phenomenal growth and expansion in the corporate sector. The growing demand for 
specialists in almost every sphere of the corporate functions has led to emergence of professionals who can 
perform specialized skills with near perfection in their respective fields. A company secretary is one such 
professional who is responsible for efficient management of the corporate sector. He ensures compliance of 
various company legislations and advises directors on statutory requirements of the company. Apart from 
carrying out these functions, he also looks after finance, accounts, legal, secretarial, personnel and 
administrative functions in private as well as public sectors. 
The Companies Act, 2013 confers a special status to Company Secretary as the key managerial personnel 
and has bracketed him along with Managing Director (MD) or Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or Manager, 
Whole-time director(s) or Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Every listed company and every other public 
company having a paid up share capital of ten crore rupees or more has to appoint a whole time Key 
Managerial Personnel. Whole time Company Secretary is also required to be appointed in other companies 
which have a paid up share capital of five crore rupees or more. 
Almost every kind of organization whose affairs are conducted by boards, councils or other corporate 
structures, be it a company, trust, association, federation, authority, commission or the like find it useful to 
appoint a person who holds the qualification of Company Secretaryship in key administrative position. 
Practising Company Secretaries have been authorized to issue Certificate regarding compliance of 
conditions of Corporate Governance. Practising Company Secretaries have also been recognized to appear 
before various Tribunals such as NCLT, NCLAT, Securities Appellate Tribunal, Competition Commission of 
India, Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal, Consumer Forums, Tax Tribunals etc. Reserve 
Bank of India has also recognized the Practising Company Secretaries to undertake Diligence Report for 
Banks. 
The rapid Change in Indian Legislative has brought about a sea change in the role and profile of a company 
secretary. They are now being seen as corporate development planners. Besides embarking upon traditional 
areas of practice, Company Secretaries in Practice are increasingly required to advise and guide on legal 
aspects of business which intimately concern areas such as registration under RERA, production, drafting of 
various documents, sales, marketing and administration for identifying expansion opportunities, issuing due 
diligence or comfort certificate, arranging foreign collaborations, amalgamations, mergers, acquisition, 
EP-EBCL

takeovers, setting up of subsidiaries and joint ventures within and outside India etc. The new opportunities 
offered by the growing capital markets and financial services have greatly contributed to the development of 
the practice side of the profession.

LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL 
446 
INTRODUCTION 
The Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 was enacted to prohibit benami transactions and the right 
to recover property held benami. The said Act, inter alia, provides that—(a) all the properties held benami 
shall be subject to acquisition by such authority in such manner and after following such procedure as may 
be prescribed; (b) no amount shall be payable for the acquisition of any property held benami; (c) the 
purchase of property by any person in the name of his wife or unmarried daughter for their benefit would not 
be benami transaction; (d) the securities held by a depository as registered owner under the provisions of the 
Depositories Act, 1996 or participant as an agent of a depository would not be benami transactions.  
During the administration of the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988, it was found that the provisions 
of the aforesaid Act are inadequate to deal with benami transactions as the Act does not—(i) contain any 
specific provision for vesting of confiscated property with Central Government; (ii) have any provision for an 
appellate mechanism against an action taken by the authorities under the Act, while barring the jurisdiction of 
a civil court; (iii) confer the powers of the civil court upon the authorities for its implementation; and (iv) 
provide for adequate enabling rule making powers.  
In view of the circumstances stated above, comprehensive amendments to the Benami Transactions 
(Prohibition) Act, 1988 has become necessary in order to prohibit holding property in benami and restrict 
right to recover or transfer property held benami and also to provide a mechanism and procedure for 
confiscation of property held benami. It is, therefore, felt necessary to bring comprehensive amendments to 
the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 to deal with benami transactions.  
With a view to providing effective regime for prohibition of benami transactions, the Benami Transactions 
(Prohibition) Act, 1988 was amended through the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amended Act, 2016. 
The amended law empowers the specified authorities to provisionally attach benami properties which can 
eventually be confiscated. Besides, if a person is found guilty of offence of benami transaction by the 
competent court, he shall be punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than one year but 
which may extend to 7 years and shall also be liable to fine which may extend to 25% of the fair market value 
of the property.  
The legislation is also intended to effectively prohibit benami transactions and consequently prevent 
circumvention of law through unfair practices. It empowers the Government to confiscate benami property by 
following due procedure. It therefore promotes equity across all citizens. However, those who declare their 
benami properties under income declaration scheme will get immunity under the Benami Act.  
The Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016 received the assent of the President on 
the10th August, 2016and came into effect from1st November, 2016. 
The Salient Features of the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 are as under: 
It defines a benami transaction and benami property and also provides for exclusions and 
transactions which shall not be construed benami 
It provides the consequences of entering into a prohibited benami transactions 
It lays down the procedure for determination and related penal consequences in the case of 
a prohibited benami transaction 
It also provides that the powers of civil court shall be available to authorities under the said 
Act 
                                                                       Lesson 18        The Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 447 
Miscellaneous Provisions have been provided for service of notice, protection of action taken 
in good faith, etc. 
Central Government empowers to make rules for the implementation of the provisions of the 
Bill 
It enables the Central Government in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court to 
designate one or more Courts of Session as Special Court or Special Courts for the purpose 
of the Bill 
It provides penalty for entering into benami transactions and for furnishing any false 
documents in any proceeding under the Bill

LESSON ROUND-UP 
• The Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 prohibits benami transactions and consequently prevent 
circumvention of law through unfair practices. It empowers the Government to confiscate benami property 
by following due procedure. It therefore promotes equity across all citizens. However, those who declare 
their benami properties under income declaration scheme will get immunity under the Benami Act.  
• The Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016received the assent of the President on the 
10th August, 2016 and came into effect from1st November, 2016. 
• Where any person enters into any benami transaction on and after the date of commencement of the 
Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016, shall be punishable in accordance with the 
provisions contained in Chapter VII. 
• Any property, which is subject matter of benami transaction, shall be liable to be confiscated by the Central 
Government.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
The globalization process driven by advancements in 
communications and information technology, have 
made the international system more interactive, 
integrated, interrelated, and interconnected. This 
dynamic 
has 
unleashed 
the 
floodgates 
of 
opportunities for criminals to expand, widen and 
deepen their reach, become more sophisticated in 
their operations, and intensify their level and pace of 
transactions.  
Because of the opportunities and needs created by 
the global dimension of business, crimes such as 
fraud, counterfeiting, corruption and embezzlement 
have opportunities to shift from individual or family 
ambit to more organized and competitive global 
structures. 
The problem of money-laundering is no longer 
restricted to the geo political boundaries of any 
country. It is a global menace that cannot be 
contained by any nation alone. In view of this, India 
has become a member of the Financial Action Task 
Force and Asia Pacific Group on money-laundering, 
which are committed to the effective implementation 
and 
enforcement 
of 
internationally 
accepted 
standards 
against 
money-laundering 
and 
the 
financing of terrorism. 
The Prevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002 
addresses the international obligations under the 
Political Declaration and Global Programme of Action 
adopted by the General Assembly of the United 
Nations to prevent money laundering. The Act was 
amended in the year 2005, 2009 and 2012 to remove 
the difficulties arisen in implementation of the Act. 
Therefore, it is essential for the students to be 
familiar with the law relating to Prevention of Money-
laundering Act, 2002. 
  
The Prevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002 enacted to prevent money laundering and to provide for confiscation of 
property derived from, or involved in, money laundering and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL 
458 
INTRODUCTION 
Money laundering is the processing of criminal proceeds to disguise its illegal origin. Terrorism, illegal arms 
sales, financial crimes, smuggling, and the activities of organised crime, including drug trafficking and 
prostitution rings, generate huge sums. Embezzlement, insider trading, bribery and computer fraud also 
produce large profits and create an incentive to legitimise the ill-gotten gains through money laundering. 
When a criminal activity generates substantial profits, the individual or group involved in such activities route 
the funds to safe heavens by disguising the sources, changing the form, or moving the funds to a place 
where they are less likely to attract attention. 
Most fundamentally, money laundering is inextricably linked to the underlying criminal activity that generates 
it. In essence, the laundering enables criminal activity to continue. 
Process of Money Laundering 
The process of money laundering can be classified into three stages, namely, placement, layering and 
integration. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the initial or placement stage of money laundering, the launderer introduces his illegal profits into the 
financial system, by breaking up large amounts of cash into less conspicuous smaller sums that are then 
deposited directly into a bank account, or by purchasing a series of monetary instruments that are later 
collected and deposited into accounts at another location. 
After the funds are entered into the financial system, the layering takes place. In this stage, the launderer 
engages in a series of conversions or movements of the funds to distance them from their source. The funds 
might be channeled through the purchase and sale of investment instruments, or the launderer might simply 
wire the funds through a series of accounts at various banks across the globe. 
After successful processing of criminal profits through the first two phases of the money laundering process, 
the launderer moves them to integration. In this stage the funds re-enter the legitimate economy. The 
launderer might choose to invest the funds into real estate, luxury assets, or business ventures. 
Impact of Money Laundering on Development 
Economies with growing or developing financial centers, but inadequate controls are particularly vulnerable 
to money laundering, as against the established financial center countries, which implement comprehensive 
anti-money laundering regimes. The gaps in a national anti-money laundering system are exploited by 
launderers, who tend to move their networks to countries and financial systems with weak or ineffective 
countermeasures. As with the damaged integrity of an individual financial institution, there is a damping 
effect on foreign direct investment when a country’s commercial and financial sectors are perceived to be 
subject to the control and influence of organised crime.

In times of decelerating growth, an infusion of hard currency can bolster a country’s foreign reserves; ease 
the hardship associated with budget tightening policies and moderate foreign indebtedness. While these are 
short-term benefits associated with an inflow of criminal monies, the long-term effects are mostly negative. 
One difference between official borrowing and laundered funds is that the former can be controlled by 
Government, whereas the funds owned by criminals escape the governments ability to control and regulate 
the economy. 
The possible social, economic and political effects of money laundering, if left unchecked or dealt with 
ineffectively, are serious. Through the process of money laundering, organised crime can infiltrate financial 
institutions, acquire control of large sectors of the economy through investment, or offer bribes to public 
officials and indeed governments. Thus, the economic and political influence of criminal organisations can 
weaken the social fabric, ethical standards and ultimately the democratic institutions of society. 
What is the connection of money laundering with society at large? 
The possible social and political costs of money laundering, if left unchecked or dealt 
with ineffectively, are serious. Organised crime can infiltrate financial institutions, 
acquire control of large sectors of the economy through investment, or offer bribes to 
public officials and indeed governments.  
The economic and political influence of criminal organisations can weaken the social 
fabric, collective ethical standards, and ultimately the democratic institutions of 
society. In countries transitioning to democratic systems, this criminal influence can 
undermine the transition. Most fundamentally, money laundering is inextricably 
linked to the underlying criminal activity that generated it. Laundering enables 
criminal activity to continue. 
 
Prevention of Money Laundering – Global Initiatives 
Since money laundering is an international phenomenon, transnational co-operation is of critical importance 
in the fight against this menace. A number of initiatives have been taken to deal with the problem at 
international level. In this context, the United Nations or the Bank for International Settlements, took some 
initiatives in 1980s to address the problem of money laundering. However, with the creation of the Financial 
Action Task Force (FATF) in 1989, regional groupings, such as the European Union, Council of Europe, and 
organisation of American States also established anti- money laundering standards for their member 
countries. 
The major international agreements addressing money laundering include the United Nations Convention 
against Illicit Trafficking in Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (the Vienna Convention) and Council of 
Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds of Crime. The role of 
financial institutions in preventing and detecting money laundering has also been the subject of 
pronouncements by the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation Supervisory Practices, the European Union 
and the International Organization of Securities Commissions. 
The Vienna Convention 
The first major initiative in the prevention of money laundering was the United Nations Convention against 
Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances in December 1988 (popularly known as Vienna 
Convention). This convention laid the groundwork for efforts to combat money laundering by obliging the 
member states to criminalize the laundering of money from drug trafficking. It promotes international 
cooperation in investigations and makes extradition between member states applicable to money laundering. 
EP-EBCL 
460 
The convention also establishes the principle that domestic bank secrecy provisions should not interfere with 
international criminal investigations. 
Council of Europe Convention 
The Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime, 
1990 establishes a common policy on money laundering. It sets out a common definition of money 
laundering and common measures for dealing with it. The Convention lays down the principles for 
international cooperation among the member states, which may also include states outside the Council of 
Europe. This convention came into force in September 1993. One of the purposes of the convention is to 
facilitate international cooperation as regards investigative assistance, search, seizure and confiscation of 
the proceeds of all types of criminality, particularly serious crimes, such as, drug offences, arms dealing, 
terrorist offences etc. and other offences which generate large profits. 
European Union Money Laundering Directive 
In response to the new opportunities for money laundering opened up by the liberalization of capital 
movements and cross-border financial services in the European Union, the Council of the European 
Communities in June, 1991 issued a directive on the Prevention of Use of the Financial System for the 
Purpose of Money Laundering. The directive requires member states to outlaw money laundering. The 
member states have been put under obligation to require financial institutions to establish and maintain 
internal systems to prevent laundering, to obtain the identification of customers with whom they enter into 
transaction of more than a particular amount and to keep proper records for at least five years. The financial 
institutions are also required to report suspicious transactions and ensure that such reporting does not result 
in liability for the institution or its employees. 
Basle Committee’s Statement of Principles 
In December 1988 the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation Supervisory Practices issued a statement of 
principles to be complied by the international banks of member states. These principles include identifying 
customers, avoiding suspicious transactions, and cooperating with law enforcement agencies. The statement 
aims at encouraging the banking sector to adopt common position in order to ensure that banks are not used 
to hide or launder funds acquired through criminal activities. 
Resolution of the International Organization of Securities Commissions 
The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) adopted, in October 1992, a resolution 
encouraging its members to take necessary steps to combat money laundering in securities and futures 
markets. 
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF)  
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 by the Ministers 
of its Member jurisdictions. The objectives of the FATF are to set standards and promote effective 
implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist 
financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system. The FATF is therefore 
a “policy-making body” which works to generate the necessary political will to bring about national legislative 
and regulatory reforms in these areas. 
The FATF has developed a series of Recommendations that are recognised as the international standard for 
combating of money laundering and the financing of terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction. They form the basis for a co-ordinated response to these threats to the integrity of the financial 
                                                                       Lesson 19        Prevention of Money Laundering

system and help ensure a level playing field. First issued in 1990, the FATF Recommendations were revised 
in 1996, 2001, 2003 and in 2012 to ensure that they remain up to date and relevant, and they are intended to 
be of universal application. 
The FATF monitors the progress of its members in implementing necessary measures, reviews money 
laundering and terrorist financing techniques and counter-measures, and promotes the adoption and 
implementation of appropriate measures globally. In collaboration with other international stakeholders, the 
FATF works to identify national-level vulnerabilities with the aim of protecting the international financial 
system from misuse. 
History of the FATF 
In response to mounting concern over money laundering, the Financial Action Task Force on Money 
Laundering (FATF) was established by the G-7 Summit that was held in Paris in 1989. Recognising the 
threat posed to the banking system and to financial institutions, the G-7 Heads of State or Government and 
President of the European Commission convened the Task Force from the G-7 member States, the 
European Commission and eight other countries. 
FATF Recommendations 
The Task Force was given the responsibility of examining money laundering techniques and trends, 
reviewing the action which had already been taken at a national or international level, and setting out the 
measures that still needed to be taken to combat money laundering. In April 1990, less than one year after 
its creation, the FATF issued a report containing a set of Forty Recommendations, which were intended to 
provide a comprehensive plan of action needed to fight against money laundering.  
In 2001, the development of standards in the fight against terrorist financing was added to the mission of the 
FATF. In October 2001 the FATF issued the Eight Special Recommendations to deal with the issue of 
terrorist financing. The continued evolution of money laundering techniques led the FATF to revise the FATF 
standards comprehensively in June 2003. In October 2004 the FATF published a Ninth Special 
Recommendations, further strengthening the agreed international standards for combating money laundering 
and terrorist financing - the 40+9 Recommendations. 
In February 2012, the FATF completed a thorough review of its standards and published the revised FATF 
Recommendations,. This revision is intended to strengthen global safeguards and further protect the integrity 
of the financial system by providing governments with stronger tools to take action against financial crime. 
They have been expanded to deal with new threats such as the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction, and to be clearer on transparency and tougher on corruption. The 9 Special Recommendations 
on terrorist financing have been fully integrated with the measures against money laundering. This has 
resulted in a stronger and clearer set of standards. 
United Nations Global Programme Against Money Laundering 
Office of the Drug Control and Crime Prevention implement this programme against Money Laundering with 
a view to increase the effectiveness of international action against money laundering through comprehensive 
technical cooperation services offered to Governments. The programme encompasses following three areas 
of activities, providing various means to states and institutions in their efforts to effectively combat money 
laundering: 
 
(i) Technical cooperation is the main task of the Programme. It encompasses activities of creating 
awareness, institution building and training. 
 
EP-EBCL 
462 
 
(ii) The research and analysis aims at offering States Key Information to better understand the 
phenomenon of money laundering and to enable the international community to devise more 
efficient and effective countermeasure strategies. 
 
(iii) The commitment to support the establishment of financial investigation services for raising the 
overall effectiveness of law enforcement measures. 
The implementation of the Global Programme against Money Laundering is carried out in the spirit of 
cooperation with other international, regional and national organizations and institutions. 
 
What influence does money laundering have on economic development? 
Launderers are continuously looking for new routes for laundering their 
funds. Economies with growing or developing financial centres, but 
inadequate controls are particularly vulnerable as established financial 
centre countries implement comprehensive anti-money laundering regimes. 
Differences between national anti-money laundering systems will be 
exploited by launderers, who tend to move their networks to countries and 
financial systems with weak or ineffective countermeasures. 
Some might argue that developing economies cannot afford to be too 
selective about the sources of capital they attract. But postponing action is 
dangerous. The more it is deferred, the more entrenched organised crime 
can become. 
As with the damaged integrity of an individual financial institution, there is a damping effect on foreign direct 
investment when a country’s commercial and financial sectors are perceived to be subject to the control and 
influence of organised crime. Fighting money laundering and terrorist financing is therefore a part of creating 
a business friendly environment which is a precondition for lasting economic development.

(KYC) Norms/ (AML) Measures/ (CFT) Guidelines – Anti Money Laundering Standards 
RBI issued Master Circular on Know Your Customer (KYC) norms/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) 
standards/Combating of Financing of Terrorism (CFT)/Obligation of banks under Prevention of Money 
Laundering Act, (PMLA), 2002 and Banks were advised to follow certain customer identification procedure 
for opening of accounts and monitoring transactions of a suspicious nature for the purpose of reporting it to 
appropriate authority. These ‘Know Your Customer’ guidelines have been revisited in the context of the 
Recommendations made by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Anti Money Laundering (AML) 
standards and on Combating Financing of Terrorism (CFT). Banks have been advised to ensure that a 
proper policy framework on ‘Know Your Customer’ and Anti-Money Laundering measures with the approval 
of the Board is formulated and put in place. 
The objective of KYC Norms/ AML Measures/ CFT Guidelines  
The objective of Know Your Customer (KYC) Norms/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Measures/Combating of 
Financing of Terrorism (CFT) guidelines is to prevent banks from being used, intentionally or unintentionally, 
by criminal elements for money laundering or terrorist financing activities. KYC procedures also enable 
banks to know/understand their customers and their financial dealings better which in turn help them manage 
their risks prudently. 
Obligation of Banks 
• Banks should keep in mind that the information collected from the customer for the purpose of opening 
of account is to be treated as confidential and details thereof are not to be divulged for cross selling or 
any other like purposes. Banks should, therefore, ensure that information sought from the customer is 
relevant to the perceived risk, is not intrusive, and is in conformity with the guidelines issued in this 
regard. Any other information from the customer should be sought separately with his/her consent and 
after opening the account. 
• Banks should ensure that any remittance of funds by way of demand draft, mail/telegraphic transfer or 
any other mode and issue of travellers’cheques for value of Rupees fifty thousand and above is 
effected by debit to the customer’s account or against cheques and not against cash payment.  
• Banks should ensure that the provisions of Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 1976 as amended 
from time to time, wherever applicable are strictly adhered to. 
KYC Policy 
Banks should frame their KYC policies incorporating the following four key elements: 
 
 
 
 
 
EP-EBCL 
470 
For the purpose of KYC policy, a ‘Customer’ is defined as: 
• a person or entity that maintains an account and/or has a business relationship with the bank; 
• one on whose behalf the account is maintained (i.e. the beneficial owner); 
• beneficiaries of transactions conducted by professional intermediaries, such as Stock Brokers, 
Chartered Accountants, Solicitors etc. as permitted under the law, and 
• any person or entity connected with a financial transaction which can pose significant reputational or 
other risks to the bank, say, a wire transfer or issue of a high value demand draft as a single 
transaction. 
Introduction of New Technologies – Credit cards/debit cards/ smart cards/gift cards 
Banks should pay special attention to any money laundering threats that may arise from new or developing 
technologies including internet banking that might favour anonymity, and take measures, if needed, to 
prevent their use in money laundering schemes. Many banks are engaged in the business of issuing a 
variety of Electronic Cards that are used by customers for buying goods and services, drawing cash from 
ATMs, and can be used for electronic transfer of funds. Banks are required to ensure full compliance with all 
KYC/AML/CFT guidelines issued from time to time, in respect of add-on/ supplementary cardholders also. 
Further, marketing of credit cards is generally done through the services of agents. Banks should ensure that 
appropriate KYC procedures are duly applied before issuing the cards to the customers. It is also desirable 
that agents are also subjected to KYC measures. 
Information to be preserved 
Banks are required to maintain all necessary information in respect of transactions to permit reconstruction of 
individual transaction, including the following information: 
 
(a) the nature of the transactions; 
 
(b) the amount of the transaction and the currency in which it was denominated; 
 
(c) the date on which the transaction was conducted; and 
 
(d) the parties to the transaction 
Maintenance and Preservation of record 
 
(a) Banks are required to maintain the records containing information of all transactions. Banks should 
take appropriate steps to evolve a system for proper maintenance and preservation of account 
information in a manner that allows data to be retrieved easily and quickly whenever required or 
when requested by the competent authorities.  
 
(b) Banks should ensure that records pertaining to the identification of the customer and his address 
(e.g. copies of documents like passports, identity cards, driving licenses, PAN card, utility bills etc.) 
obtained while opening the account and during the course of business relationship, are properly 
preserved. The identification records and transaction data should be made available to the 
competent authorities upon request. 
 
(c) Banks have been advised to pay special attention to all complex, unusual large transactions and all 
unusual patterns of transactions, which have no apparent economic or visible lawful purpose. It is 
further clarified that the background including all documents/office records/memorandums 
pertaining to such transactions and purpose thereof should, as far as possible, be examined and the 
                                                                       Lesson 19        Prevention of Money Laundering 
471 
findings at branch as well as Principal Officer level should be properly recorded. Such records and 
related documents should be made available to help auditors in their day-to-day work relating to 
scrutiny of transactions and also to Reserve Bank/other relevant authorities.  
Reporting to Financial Intelligence Unit – India 
In terms of the PMLA Rules, banks are required to report information relating to cash and suspicious 
transactions and all transactions involving receipts by non-profit organisations of value more than rupees ten 
lakh or its equivalent in foreign currency to the Director, Financial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND) in respect 
of transactions.

LESSON ROUND-UP 
• 
Money laundering is the processing of criminal proceeds to disguise its illegal origin. 
• 
The process of money laundering can be classified into three stages, namely, placement, layering and integration. 
• 
The Prevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002 was enacted to prevent money laundering and to provide for 
confiscation of property derived from, or involved in, money laundering and for matters connected therewith or 
incidental thereto.  
• 
The Act also addresses the international obligations under the Political Declaration and Global Programme of Action 
adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations to prevent money laundering. 
• 
The Act contains provisions pertaining to offences and punishment for money laundering, attachment, adjudication 
and confiscation, obligations of banking companies, financial institutions and intermediaries, Summons, Searches 
and Seizures etc.  
• 
The Act states that whoever, acquires, owns, possesses, or transfers any proceeds of crime or knowingly enters into 
any transaction which is related to proceeds of crime directly or indirectly or conceals or aids in the concealment of 
the proceeds of crime, shall be guilty of offence of money laundering. 
• 
Every banking company, financial institution and intermediary is required to maintain a record of all transactions, the 
nature and value of which may be prescribed, whether such transactions comprise of a single transaction or a series 
of transactions legally connected to each other, and when such series of transactions take place within a month. 
• 
The objective of Know Your Customer (KYC) Norms/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Measures/Combating of 
Financing of Terrorism (CFT) guidelines is to prevent banks from being used, intentionally or unintentionally, by 
criminal elements for money laundering or terrorist financing activities. KYC procedures also enable banks to 
know/understand their customers and their financial dealings better which in turn help them manage their risks 
prudently.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
A contract is an agreement enforceable at law, 
made between two or more persons, by which 
rights are acquired by one or more to acts or 
forbearances on the part of the other or others. A 
contract is an agreement creating and defining 
obligations between the parties. 
The Indian Contract Act, 1872 regulates all the 
transactions of a company. It lays down the general 
principles 
relating 
to 
the 
formation 
and 
enforceability of contracts; rules governing the 
provisions of an agreement and offer; the various 
types of contracts including those of indemnity and 
guarantee, bailment and pledge and agency. It also 
contains provisions pertaining to breach of a 
contract.  
The Law of Contract constitutes the most important 
branch of Mercantile or Commercial Law. It affects 
everybody, more so, trade, commerce and industry. 
It may be said that the contract is the foundation of 
the civilized world. Therefore, it is essential for the 
students to be familiar with the law relating to 
Contract.

LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL 
474 
Meaning and Nature of Contract 
The law relating to contract is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872. The Act came into force on the first 
day of September, 1872. The preamble to the Act says that it is an Act “to define and amend certain parts of 
the law relating to contract”. It extends to the whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir. The Act 
is by no means exhaustive on the law of contract. It does not deal with all the branches of the law of contract. 
Thus, contracts relating to partnership, sale of goods, negotiable instruments, insurance etc. are dealt with 
by separate Acts. 
The Indian Contract Act mostly deals with the general principles and rules governing contracts. The Act is divisible 
into two parts. The first part (Section 1-75) deals with the general principles of the law of contract, and therefore 
applies to all contracts irrespective of their nature. The second part (Sections 124-238) deals with certain special 
kinds of contracts, namely contracts of Indemnity and Guarantee, Bailment, Pledge, and Agency. 
The Indian Contract Act has defined contract in Section 2(h) as “an agreement enforceable by law”. 
These definitions indicate that a contract essentially consists of two distinct parts. First, there must be an 
agreement. Secondly, such an agreement must be enforceable by law. To be enforceable, an agreement 
must be coupled with an obligation. 
A contract therefore, is a combination of the two elements: (1) an agreement and (2) an obligation. 
Agreement 
An agreement gives birth to a contract. As per Section 2(e) of the Indian Contract Act “every promise and 
every set of promises, forming the consideration for each other, is an agreement. It is evident from the 
definition given above that an agreement is based on a promise. What is a promise? According to Section 
2(b) of the Indian Contract Act “when the person to whom the proposal is made signifies his assent thereto, 
the proposal is said to be accepted. A proposal, when accepted, becomes a promise. An agreement, 
therefore, comes into existence when one party makes a proposal or offer to the other party and that other 
party signifies his assent thereto. In nutshell, an agreement is the sum total of offer and acceptance.” 
An analysis of the definition given above reveals the following characteristics of an agreement: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
475 
Obligation 
An obligation is the legal duty to do or abstain from doing what one has promised to do or abstain from 
doing. A contractual obligation arises from a bargain between the parties to the agreement who are called 
the promisor and the promisee. Section 2(b) says that when the person to whom the proposal is made 
signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted; and a proposal when accepted becomes a 
promise. In broad sense, therefore, a contract is an exchange of promises by two or more persons, resulting 
in an obligation to do or abstain from doing a particular act, where such obligation is recognised and 
enforced by law. 
Rights and Obligations 
Where parties have made a binding contract, they have created rights and obligations between themselves. 
The contractual rights and obligations are correlative, e.g., A agrees with B to sell his car for Rs. 10,000 to 
him. In this example, the following rights and obligations have been created: 
 
(i) A is under an obligation to deliver the car to B. 
 
 B has a corresponding right to receive the car. 
 
(ii) B is under an obligation to pay `10,00,000 to A. 
 
 A has a correlative right to receive `10,00,000. 
Agreements which are not Contracts 
Agreements in which the idea of bargain is absent and there is no intention to create legal relations are not 
contracts. These are: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a) Agreements relating to social matters: An agreement between two persons to go together to the 
cinema, or for a walk, does not create a legal obligation on their part to abide by it. Similarly, if I 
promise to take you for a dinner and break that promise, I do not expect to be liable to legal 
penalties. There cannot be any offer and acceptance to hospitality. 
 
(b) Domestic arrangements between husband and wife: In Balfour v. Balfour (1919) 2 KB 571, a 
husband working in Ceylone, had agreed in writing to pay a housekeeping allowance to his wife 
living in England. On receiving information that she was unfaithful to him, he stopped the allowance. 
Held, he was entitled to do so. This was a mere domestic arrangement with no intention to create 
legally binding relations. Therefore, there was no contract. 
Three consequences follow from the above discussion: 
Agreement relating to social matters 
Domestic arrangements between husband 
and wife 
EP-EBCL 
476 
 
(i) To constitute a contract, the parties must intend to create legal relationship. 
 
(ii) The law of contract is the law of those agreements which create obligations, and those obligations 
which have their source in agreement. 
 
(iii) Agreement is the genus of which contract is the specie and, therefore, all contracts are agreements 
but all agreements are not contracts. 
ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF A VALID CONTRACT 
Section 10 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 provides that “all agreements are contracts if they are made by 
the free consent of parties competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object, and are 
not hereby expressly declared to be void”. 
The essential elements of a valid contract are: 
 
(i) An offer or proposal by one party and acceptance of that offer by another party resulting in an 
agreement—consensus-ad-idem. 
 
(ii) An intention to create legal relations or an intent to have legal consequences. 
 
(iii)  The agreement is supported by a lawful consideration. 
 
(iv) The parties to the contract are legally capable of contracting. 
 
(v) Genuine consent between the parties. 
 
(vi) The object and consideration of the contract is legal and is not opposed to public policy. 
 (vii) The terms of the contract are certain. 
 (viii) The agreement is capable of being performed i.e., it is not impossible of being performed. 
Therefore, to form a valid contract there must be (1) an agreement, (2) based on the genuine consent of the 
parties, (3) supported by a lawful consideration, (4) made for a lawful object, and (iv) between the competent 
parties. 
(a) Offer or Proposal and Acceptance 
One of the early steps in the formation of a contract lies in arriving at an agreement between the contracting 
parties by means of an offer and acceptance. Thus, when one party (the offeror) makes a definite proposal to 
another party (the offeree) and the offeree accepts it in its entirety and without any qualification, there is a 
meeting of the minds of the parties and a contract comes into being, assuming that all other elements are 
also present. 
What is an Offer or a Proposal? 
A proposal is also termed as an offer. The word ‘proposal’ is synonymous with the English word “offer”. An 
offer is a proposal by one person, whereby he expresses his willingness to enter into a contractual obligation 
in return for a promise, act or forbearance. Section 2(a) of the Indian Contract Act defines proposal or offer 
as “when one person signifies to another his willingness to do or abstain from doing anything with a view to 
obtaining the assent of that other to such act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal”. The person 
making the proposal or offer is called the proposer or offeror and the person to whom the proposal is made is 
called the offeree. 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
477 
Rules Governing Offers 
A valid offer must comply with the following rules: 
 
(a) An offer must be clear, definite, complete and final. It must not be vague. For example, a promise to 
pay an increased price for a horse if it proves lucky to promisor, is too vague and is not binding. 
 
(b) An offer must be communicated to the offeree. An offer becomes effective only when it has been 
communicated to the offeree so as to give him an opportunity to accept or reject the same. 
 
(c) The communication of an offer may be made by express words-oral or written-or it may be implied 
by conduct. A offers his car to B for `10,000. It is an express offer. A bus plying on a definite route 
goes along the street. This is an implied offer on the part of the owners of the bus to carry 
passengers at the scheduled fares for the various stages. 
 
(d) The communication of the offer may be general or specific. Where an offer is made to a specific 
person it is called specific offer and it can be accepted only by that person. But when an offer is 
addressed to an uncertain body of individuals i.e. the world at large, it is a general offer and can be 
accepted by any member of the general public by fulfilling the condition laid down in the offer. The 
leading case on the subject is Carlillv. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. The company offered by 
advertisement, a reward of `100 to anyone who contacted influenza after using their smoke ball in 
the specified manner. Mrs. Carlill did use smoke ball in the specified manner, but was attacked by 
influenza. She claimed the reward and it was held that she could recover the reward as general 
offer can be accepted by anybody. Since this offer is of a continuing nature, more than one person 
can accept it and can even claim the reward. But if the offer of reward is for seeking some 
information or seeking the restoration of missing thing, then the offer can be accepted by one 
individual who does it first of all. The condition is that the claimant must have prior knowledge of the 
reward before doing that act or providing that information. 
Example: A advertises in the newspapers that he will pay rupees one thousand to anyone who brings to him 
his lost son. B without knowing of this reward finds A’s lost son and restore him to A. In this case since B did 
not know of the reward, he cannot claim it from A even though he finds A’s lost son and brings him to A. 
In India also, in the case of HarbhajanLal  v. HarcharanLal (AIR 1925 All. 539), the same rule was applied. In 
this case, a young boy ran away from his fathers home. The father issued a pamphlet offering a reward of 
`500 to anybody who would bring the boy home. The plaintiff saw the boy at a railway station and sent a 
telegram to the boys father. It was held that the handbill was an offer open to the world at large and was 
capable to acceptance by any person who fulfilled the conditions contained in the offer. The plaintiff 
substantially performed the conditions and was entitled to the reward offered. 
An Offer must be Distinguished from 
(a) An invitation to treat or an invitation to make an offer: e.g., an auctioneers request for bids (which are 
offered by the bidders), the display of goods in a shop window with prices marked upon them, or the display 
of priced goods in a self- service store or a shopkeepers catalogue of prices are invitations to an offer. 
(b) A mere statement of intention: e.g., an announcement of a coming auction sale. Thus, a person who 
attended the advertised place of auction could not sue for breach of contract if the auction was cancelled 
(Harris v. Nickerson (1873) L.R. 8 QB 286). 
(c) A mere communication of information in the course of negotiation: e.g., a statement of the price at which 
one is prepared to consider negotiating the sale of piece of land (Harvey v. Facey (1893) A.C. 552). 
EP-EBCL 
478 
An offer that has been communicated properly continues as such until it lapses, or until it is revoked by the 
offeror, or rejected or accepted by the offeree. 
Lapse of Offer 
Section 6 deals with various modes of lapse of an offer. It states that an offer lapses if— 
 
(a) it is not accepted within the specified time (if any) or after a reasonable time, if none is specified. 
 
(b) it is not accepted in the mode prescribed or if no mode is prescribed in some usual and reasonable 
manner, e.g., by sending a letter by mail when early reply was requested; 
 
(c) the offeree rejects it by distinct refusal to accept it; 
 
(d) either the offeror or the offeree dies before acceptance; 
 
(e) the acceptor fails to fulfill a condition precedent to an acceptance. 
 
(f) the offeree makes a counter offer, it amounts to rejection of the offer and an offer by the offeree 
may be accepted or rejected by the offeror. 
Revocation of Offer by the Offeror 
An offer may be revoked by the offeror at any time before acceptance. 
Like any offer, revocation must be communicated to the offeree, as it does not take effect until it is actually 
communicated to the offeree. Before its actual communication, the offeree, may accept the offer and create a 
binding contract. The revocation must reach the offeree before he sends out the acceptance. 
An offer to keep open for a specified time (option) is not binding unless it is supported by consideration. 
Acceptance 
A contract emerges from the acceptance of an offer. Acceptance is the act of assenting by the offeree to an 
offer. Under Section 2(b) of the Contract Act when a person to whom the proposal is made signifies his 
assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted. A proposal, when accepted becomes a promise.. 
Rules Governing Acceptance 
 
(a) Acceptance may be express i.e. by words spoken or written or implied from the conduct of the 
parties. 
 
(b) If a particular method of acceptance is prescribed, the offer must be accepted in the prescribed 
manner. 
 
(c) Acceptance must be unqualified and absolute and must correspond with all the terms of the offer. 
 
(d) A counter offer or conditional acceptance operates as a rejection of the offer and causes it to lapse, 
e.g., where a horse is offered for Rs. 1,000 and the offeree counter-offers Rs. 990, the offer lapses 
by rejection. 
 
(e) Acceptance must be communicated to the offeror, for acceptance is complete the moment it is 
communicated. Where the offeree merely intended to accept but does not communicate his 
intention to the offeror, there is no contract. Mere mental acceptance is not enough. 
 
(f) Mere silence on the part of the offeree does not amount to acceptance. 
 
 Ordinarily, the offeror cannot frame his offer in such a way as to make the silence or inaction of the 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
479 
offeree as an acceptance. In other words, the offeror can prescribe the mode of acceptance but not 
the mode of rejection. 
 
(g) If the offer is one which is to be accepted by being acted upon, no communication of acceptance to 
the offeror is necessary, unless communication is stipulated for in the offer itself. 
 
 Thus, if a reward is offered for finding a lost dog, the offer is accepted by finding the dog after 
reading about the offer, and it is unnecessary before beginning to search for the dog to give notice 
of acceptance to the offeror. 
 
(h) Acceptance must be given within a reasonable time and before the offer lapses or is revoked. An 
offer becomes irrevocable by acceptance. 
 
 An acceptance never precedes an offer. There can be no acceptance of an offer which is not 
communicated. Similarly, performance of conditions of an offer without the knowledge of the specific 
offer, is no acceptance. Thus in Lalman Shukla v.GauriDutt(1913), where a servant brought the boy 
without knowing of the reward, he was held not entitled to reward because he did not know about 
the offer. 
Standing Offers 
Where a person offers to another to supply specific goods, up to a stated quantity or in any quantity which 
may be required, at a certain rate, during a fixed period, he makes a standing offer. Thus, a tender to supply 
goods as and when required, amounts to a standing offer. 
A standing offer or a tender is of the nature of a continuing offer. An acceptance of such an offer merely 
amounts to intimation that the offer will be considered to remain open during the period specified and that it 
will be accepted from time to time by placing order for specified quantities. Each successive order given, 
while the offer remains in force, is an acceptance of the standing offer as to the quantity ordered, and creates 
a separate contract. It does not bind either party unless and until such orders are given. 
Where P tendered to supply goods to L upto a certain amount and over a certain period, L’s order did not 
come up to the amount expected and P sued for breach of contract Held: Each order made was a separate 
contract and P was bound to fulfill orders made, but there was no obligation on L to make any order to all 
(Percival Ltd. v. L.C.C. (1918). 
Tickets 
Tickets purchased for entrance into places of amusement, or tickets issued by railways or bus companies, 
clock-room tickets, and many other contracts set out in printed documents contain numerous terms, of many 
of which the party receiving the ticket or document is ignorant. If a passenger on a railway train receives a 
ticket on the face of which is printed “this ticket is issued subject to the notices, regulations and conditions 
contained in the current time-tables of the railway”, the regulations and conditions referred to are deemed to 
be communicated to him and he is bound by them whether or not he has read them. He is bound even if he 
is illiterate and unable to read them. But it is important that the notice of the conditions is contemporaneous 
with the making of the contract and not after the contract has been made. 
Contracts by Post 
Contracts by post are subject to the same rules as others, but because of their importance, these are stated 
below separately: 
 
(a) An offer by post may be accepted by post, unless the offeror indicates anything to the contrary. 
EP-EBCL 
480 
 
(b) An offer is made only when it actually reaches the offeree and not before, i.e., when the letter 
containing the offer is delivered to the offeree. 
 
(c) An acceptance is made as far as the offeror is concerned, as soon as the letter containing the 
acceptance is posted, to offerors correct address; it binds the offeror, but not the acceptor. 
 
 An acceptance binds the acceptor only when the letter containing the acceptance reaches the 
offeror. The result is that the acceptor can revoke his acceptance before it reaches the offeror. 
 
(d) An offer may be revoked before the letter containing the acceptance is posted. An acceptance can 
be revoked before it reaches the offeror. 
Contracts over the Telephone 
Contracts over the telephone are regarded the same in principle as those negotiated by the parties in the 
actual presence of each other. In both cases an oral offer is made and an oral acceptance is expected. It is 
important that the acceptance must be audible, heard and understood by the offeror. If during the 
conversation the telephone lines go “dead” and the offeror does not hear the offerees word of acceptance, 
there is no contract at the moment. If the whole conversation is repeated and the offeror hears and 
understands the words of acceptance, the contract is complete (Kanhaiyalal v. Dineshwarchandra (1959) 
AIR, M.P. 234). 
(b) Intention to Create Legal Relations 
The second essential element of a valid contract is that there must be an intention among the parties that the 
agreement should be attached by legal consequences and create legal obligations. If there is no such 
intention on the part of the parties, there is no contract between them. Agreements of a social or domestic 
nature do not contemplate legal relationship. As such they are not contracts. 
A proposal or an offer is made with a view to obtain the assent to the other party and when that other party 
expresses his willingness to the act or abstinence proposed, he accepts the offer and a contract is made 
between the two. But both offer and acceptance must be made with the intention of creating legal relations 
between the parties. The test of intention is objective. The Courts seek to give effect to the presumed 
intention of the parties. Where necessary, the Court would look into the conduct of the parties, for much can 
be inferred from the conduct. The Court is not concerned with the mental intention of the parties, but rather 
with what a reasonable man would say, was the intention of the parties, having regard to all the 
circumstances of the case. 
For example, if two persons agree to assist each other by rendering advice, in the pursuit of virtue, science 
or art, it cannot be regarded as a contract. In commercial and business agreements, the presumption is 
usually that the parties intended to create legal relations. But this presumption is rebuttable which means that 
it must be shown that the parties did not intend to be legally bound. 
(c) Consideration 
 
Need for Consideration 
Consideration is one of the essential elements of a valid contract. The requirement of consideration stems 
from the policy of extending the arm of the law to the enforcement of mutual promises of parties. A mere 
promise is not enforceable at law. For example, if A promises to make a gift of `500 to B, and subsequently 
changes his mind, B cannot succeed against A for breach of promise, as B has not given anything in return. 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
481 
It is only when a promise is made for something in return from the promisee, that such promise can be 
enforced by law against the promisor. This something in return is the consideration for the promise. 
Definition of Consideration 
Sir Fredrick Pollock has defined consideration “as an act or forbearance of one party, or the promise thereof 
is the price for which the promise of the other is bought”. 
It is “some right, interest, profit, or benefit accruing to one party or some forbearance, detriment, loss or 
responsibility, given, suffered or undertaken by the other” (Currie v. Misa (1875) L.R. 10 Ex. 153). 
Section 2(d) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 defines consideration thus: “when at the desire of the promisor, 
the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains from doing, or 
promises to do or to abstain from doing something, such act or abstinence or promise is called a 
consideration for the promise”. 
The fundamental principle that consideration is essential in every contract, is laid down by both the 
definitions but there are some important points of difference in respect of the nature and extent of 
consideration and parties to it under the two systems: 
 
(a) Consideration at the desire of the promisor: Section 2(d) of the Act begins with the statement that 
consideration must move at the desire or request of the promisor. This means that whatever is done 
must have been done at the desire of the promisor and not voluntarily or not at the desire of a third 
party. If A rushes to B’s help whose house is on fire, there is no consideration but a voluntary act. 
But if A goes to B’s help at B’s request, there is good consideration as B did not wish to do the act 
gratuitously. 
 
(b) Consideration may move from the promisee or any other person: In English law, consideration must 
move from the promisee, so that a stranger to the consideration cannot sue on the contract. A 
person seeking to enforce a simple contract must prove in court that he himself has given the 
consideration in return for the promise he is seeking to enforce. 
In Indian law, however, consideration may move from the promisee or any other person, so that a stranger to 
the consideration may maintain a suit. In Chinnaya v. Ramaya, (1882) 4 Mad. 137, a lady by a deed of gift 
made over certain property to her daughter directing her to pay an annuity to the donors brother as had been 
done by the donor herself before she gifted the property. On the same day, her daughter executed in writing 
in favour of the donors brother agreeing to pay the annuity. Afterwards the donee (the daughter) declined to 
fulfil her promise to pay her uncle saying that no consideration had moved from him. The Court, however, 
held that the uncle could sue even though no part of the consideration received by his niece moved from 
him. The consideration from her mother was sufficient consideration. 
Privity of Contract 
A stranger to a contract cannot sue both under the English and Indian law for want of privity of contract. The 
following illustration explains this point. 
In Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. v. Selfridge Ltd. (1915) A.C. 847, D supplied tyres to a wholesaler X, on 
condition that any retailer to whom X re-supplied the tyres should promise X, not to sell them to the public 
below Ds list price. X supplied tyres to S upon this condition, but nevertheless S sold the tyres below the list 
price. Held: There was a contract between D and X and a contract between X and S. Therefore, D could not 
obtain damages from S, as D had not given any consideration for Ss promise to X nor was he party to the 
contract between D and X. 
EP-EBCL 
482 
Thus, a person who is not a party to a contract cannot sue upon it even though the contract is for his benefit. 
A, who is indebted to B, sells his property to C, and C the purchaser of the property, promises to pay off the 
debt to B. In case C fails to pay B, B has no right to sue C for there is no privity of contract between B and C. 
The leading English case on the point is Tweddle v. Atkinson (1861) 1B and Section 393. In this case, the 
father of a boy and the father of a girl who was to be married to the boy, agreed that each of them shall pay a 
sum of money to the boy who was to take up the new responsibilities of married life. After the demise of both 
the contracting parties, the boy (the husband) sued the executors of his father-in-law upon the agreement 
between his father-in-law and his father. Held: the suit was not maintainable as the boy was not a party to 
the contract. 
Exception to the doctrine of privity of contract: Both the Indian law and the English law recognize certain 
exceptions to the rule that a stranger to a contract cannot sue on the contract. In the following cases, a 
person who is not a party to a contract can enforce the contract: 
 
(i) A beneficiary under an agreement to create a trust can sue upon the agreement, though not a party 
to it, for the enforcement of the trust so as to get the trust executed for his benefit. In Khawaja 
Muhammad v. Hussaini Begum, (1910) 32 All. 410, it was held that where a Mohammedan lady 
sued her father-in- law to recover arrears of allowance payable to her by him under an agreement 
between him and her own father in consideration of her marriage, she could enforce the promise in 
her favour in so far as she was a beneficiary under the agreement to make a settlement in her 
favour, and she was claiming as beneficiary under such settlement. 
 
(ii) An assignee under an assignment made by the parties, or by the operation of law (e.g. in case of 
death or insolvency), can sue upon the contract for the enforcement of his rights, tittle and interest. 
But a mere nominee (i.e., the person for whose benefit another has insured his own life) cannot sue 
on the policy because the nominee is not an assignee. 
 
(iii) In cases of family arrangements or settlements between male members of a Hindu family which 
provide for the maintenance or expenses for marriages of female members, the latter though not 
parties to the contract, possess an actual beneficial right which place them in the position of 
beneficiaries under the contract, and can therefore, sue. 
 
(iv) In case of acknowledgement of liability, e.g., where A receives money from B for paying to C, and 
admits to C the receipt of that amount, then A constitutes himself as the agent of C. 
 
(v) Whenever the promisor is by his own conduct estopped from denying his liability to perform the 
promise, the person who is not a party to the contract can sue upon it to make the promisor liable. 
 
(vi) In cases where a person makes a promise to an individual for the benefit of third party and creates 
a charge on certain immovable property for the purpose, the third party can enforce the promise 
though, he is stranger to the contract. 
Kinds of Consideration 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Kind of Consideration 
Executory or future 
Executed or  present 
Past which means a 
past act or forbearance 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
483 
 
Consideration may be: 
 
(a) Executory or future which means that it makes the form of promise to be performed in the future, 
e.g., an engagement to marry someone; or 
 
(b) Executed or present in which it is an act or forbearance made or suffered for a promise. In other 
words, the act constituting consideration is wholly or completely performed, e.g., if A pays today Rs. 
100 to a shopkeeper for goods which are promised to be supplied the next day, A has executed his 
consideration but the shopkeeper is giving executory consideration—a promise to be executed the 
following day. If the price is paid by the buyer and the goods are delivered by the seller at the same 
time, consideration is executed by both the parties. 
 
(c) Past which means a past act or forbearance, that is to say, an act constituting consideration which 
took place and is complete (wholly executed) before the promise is made. 
According to English law, a consideration may be executory or executed but never past. The English law is 
that past consideration is no consideration. The Indian law recognizes all the above three kinds of 
consideration. 
Rules Governing Consideration 
 
(a) Every simple contact must be supported by valuable consideration otherwise it is formally void 
subject to some exceptions. 
 
(b) Consideration may be an act of abstinence or promise. 
 
(c) There must be mutuality i.e., each party must do or agree to do something. A gratuitous promise as 
in the case of subscription for charity, is not enforceable. For example, where A promises to 
subscribe `5,000 for the repair of a temple, and then refuses to pay, no action can be taken against 
him. 
 
(d) Consideration must be real, and not vague, indefinite, or illusory, e.g., a son’s promise to “stop 
being a nuisance” to his father, being vague, is no consideration. 
 
(e) Although consideration must have some value, it need not be adequate i.e., a full return for the 
promise. Section 25 (Exp. II) clearly provides that “an agreement to which the consent of the 
promisor is freely given is not void merely because the consideration is inadequate”. It is upon the 
parties to fix their own prices. For example, where A voluntarily agreed to sell his motor car for `500 
to B, it became a valid contract despite the inadequancy of the consideration. 
 
(f) Consideration must be lawful, e.g., it must not be some illegal act such as paying someone to 
commit a crime. If the consideration is unlawful, the agreement is void. 
 
(g) Consideration must be something more than the promisee is already bound to do for the promisor. 
Thus, an agreement to perform an existing obligation made with the person to whom the obligation 
is already owed, is not made for consideration. For example, if a seaman deserts his ship so 
breaking his contract of service and is induced to return to his duty by the promise for extra wages, 
he cannot later sue for the extra wages since he has only done what he had already contracted for: 
Stilk  v. Myrick (1809). 
When Consideration not Necessary 
The general rule is that an agreement made without consideration is void. But Section 25 of the Indian 
EP-EBCL 
484 
Contract Act lays down certain exceptions which make a promise without consideration valid and binding. 
Thus, an agreement without consideration is valid: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The requirements in the above exceptions are noteworthy. The first one requires written and registered 
promise. The second may be oral or in writing and the third must be in writing. 
Illustrations 
A, for natural love and affection, promises to give his son B `10,000. A put his promise to B into writing and 
registered it. This is a contract. 
A registered agreement between a husband and his wife to pay his earnings to her is a valid contract, as it is 
in writing, is registered, is between parties standing in near relation, and is for love and affection (Poonoo 
Bibi v. FyazBuksh, (1874) 15 Bom L.R. 57). 
But where a husband by a registered document, after referring to quarrels and disagreement between 
himself and his wife, promised to pay his wife a sum of money for her maintenance and separate residence, 
it was held that the promise was unenforceable, as it was not made for love and affection (Rajluckhy Deb 
v.Bhootnath(1900) 4 C.W.N. 488). 
Whether Gratuitous Promise can be Enforced 
A gratuitous promise to subscribe to a charitable cause cannot be enforced, but if the promisee is put to 
some detriment as a result of his acting on the faith of the promise and the promisor knew the purpose and 
also knew that on the faith of the subscription an obligation might be incurred, the promisor would be bound 
by promise (KedarNath v. Gorie Mohan 64). 
It may be noted that it is not necessary that the promisor should benefit by the consideration, it is sufficient if 
the promisee does some act from which a third person is benefited and he would not have done that act but 
for the promise of the promisor. 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
485 
For example, Y requests X for loan, who agrees to give loan to Y if S gives guarantee of repayment of the 
loan. S gives such a guarantee of repayment by Y. Thereupon X gives loan to Y. Here S will be promisor and 
X the promisee, but from X’s action, benefit is derived by Y and not by S. X would not have given the loan to 
Y had S not given the guarantee of repayment of loan. Thus, the benefit conferred on Y by X at the request 
of S is a sufficient consideration on the part of X as against the promise of S to repay the loan. Alternatively, 
it may be said that the detriment which X suffered by giving loan to Y at the request of S is sufficient 
consideration on the part of X in respect of the promise of S to repay the loan. 
Consideration therefore, is some detriment to the promisee or some benefit to the promisor. Detriment to one 
person and benefit to the other are the same things looked from two angles. Ordinarily a promisor is not 
bound by his promise, unless some consideration is offered by the promisee. 
Terms Must be Certain 
It follows from what has been explained in relation to offer, acceptance and consideration that to be binding, 
an agreement must result in a contract. That is to say, the parties must agree on the terms of their contract. 
They must make their intentions clear in their contract. The Court will not enforce a contract the terms of 
which are uncertain. Thus, an agreement to agree in the future (a contract to make a contract) will not 
constitute a binding contract e.g., a promise to pay an actress a salary to be “mutually agreed between us” is 
not a contract since the salary is not yet agreed: Loftus v. Roberts (1902). 
Similarly, where the terms of a final agreement are too vague, the contract will fail for uncertainty. Hence, the 
terms must be definite or capable of being made definite without further agreement of the parties. 
The legal maxim, therefore, is “a contract to contract is not a contract”. If you agree “subject to contract” or 
“subject to agreement”, the contract does not come into existence, for there is no definite or unqualified 
acceptance. 
Resume 
Thus, a contract is always based upon: 
 
(i) Agreement (consensus ad idem) an unqualified acceptance of a definite offer; 
 
(ii) An intent to create legal obligations; and 
 
(iii) Consideration. 
FLAWS IN CONTRACT 
There may be the circumstances under which a contract made under these rules may still be bad, because 
there is a flaw, vice or error somewhere. As a result of such a flaw, the apparent agreement is not a real 
agreement. 
Where there is no real agreement, the law has three remedies: 
Firstly: The agreement may be treated as of no effect and it will then be known as void agreement. 
Secondly: The law may give the party aggrieved the option of getting out of his bargain, and the contract is 
then known as voidable. 
Thirdly: The party at fault may be compelled to pay damages to the other party. 
(a) Void Agreement  
A void agreement is one which is destitute of all legal effects. It cannot be enforced and confers no rights on 
EP-EBCL 
486 
either party. It is really not a contract at all, it is non-existent. Technically the words ‘void contract’ are a 
contradiction in terms. But the expression provides a useful label for describing the situation that arises when 
a ‘contract’ is claimed but in fact does not exist. For example, a minors contract is void. 
(b) Voidable Contract  
A voidable contract is one which a party can put to an end. He can exercise his option, if his consent was not 
free. The contract will, however be binding, if he does not exercise his option to avoid it within a reasonable 
time. The consent of a party is not free and so he is entitled to avoid the contract, if he has given his cosent 
due to misrepresentation, fraud, coercion or undue influence. 
(c) Illegal Agreement 
An illegal agreement is one which, like the void agreement has no legal effects as between the immediate 
parties. Further, transactions collateral to it also become tainted with illegality and are, therefore, not 
enforceable. Parties to an unlawful agreement cannot get any help from a Court of law, for no polluted hands 
shall touch the pure fountain of justice. On the other hand, a collateral transaction can be supported by a 
void agreement. 
For example, one party may have deceived the other party, or in some other way there may be no genuine 
consent. The parties may be labouring under a mistake, or one or both the parties may be incapable of 
making a contract. Again, the agreement may be illegal or physically impossible. All these are called “the 
FLAWS in contract or the VICES of contract”. 
The chief flaws in contract are: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(i) Flaw in Capacity Capacity and Persons 
In law, persons are either natural or artificial. Natural persons are human beings and artificial persons are 
corporations. Contractual capacity or incapacity is an incident of personality. 
The general rule is that all natural persons have full capacity to make binding contracts. But the Indian 
Contract Act, 1872 admits an exception in the case of: 
 
(i) minors, 
 
(ii) lunatics, and 
 
(iii) persons disqualified from contracting by any law to which they are subject. 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
487 
These persons are not competent to contract. Section 11 provides that every “person is competent to contract 
who is of the age of majority according to the law to which he is subject, and who is of sound mind, and is not 
disqualified from contracting by any law to which he is subject”. A valid agreement requires that both the parties 
should understand the legal implications of their conduct. Thus, both must have a mature mind. The legal 
yardstick to measure maturity according to the law of contract is, that both should be major and of sound mind 
and if not, the law would presume that the maturity of their mind has not reached to the extent of visualising the 
pros and cons of their acts, hence, a bar on minors and lunatics competency to contract. 
The contractual capacity of a corporation depends on the manner in which it was created. 
Minor’s Contract 
According to the Indian Majority Act, 1875, a minor is a person, male or female, who has not completed the 
age of 18 years. In case a guardian has been appointed to the minor or where the minor is under the 
guardianship of the Court of Wards, the person continues to be a minor until he completes his age of 21 
years. According to the Indian Contract Act, no person is competent to enter into a contract who is not of the 
age of majority. It was finally laid down by the Privy Council in the leading case of Mohori Bibi v. 
DharmodasGhose, (1903) 30 Cal. 539, that a minor has no capacity to contract and minors contract is 
absolutely void. In this case, X, a minor borrowed Rs. 20,000 from Y, a money lender. As a security for the 
money advanced, X executed a mortgage in Y’s favour. When sued by Y, the Court held that the contract by 
X was void and he cannot be compelled to repay the amount advanced by him. 
Indian Courts have applied this decision to those cases where the minor has incurred any liability or where 
the liabilities on both sides are outstanding. In such cases, the minor is not liable. But if the minor has carried 
out his part of the contract, then, the Courts have held, that he can proceed against the other party. The 
rationale is to protect minors interest. According to the Transfer of Property Act, a minor cannot transfer 
property but he can be a transferee (person accepting a transfer). This statutory provision is an illustration of 
the above principle. 
The following points must be kept in mind with respect to minors contract: 
 
(a) A minor’s contract is altogether void in law, and a minor cannot bind himself by a contract. If the 
minor has obtained any benefit, such as money on a mortgage, he cannot be asked to repay, nor 
can his mortgaged property be made liable to pay. 
 
(b) Since the contract is void ab initio, it cannot be ratified by the minor on attaining the age of majority. 
 
(c) Estoppel is an important principle of the law of evidence. To explain, suppose X makes a statement 
to Y and intends that the latter should believe and act upon it. Later on, X cannot resile from this 
statement and make a new one. 
 
 In otherwords, X will be estopped from denying his previous statement. But a minor can always 
plead minority and is not estopped from doing so even where he had produced a loan or entered 
into some other contract by falsely representing that he was of full age, when in reality he was a 
minor. 
 
 But where the loan was obtained by fraudulent representation by the minor or some property was 
sold by him and the transactions are set aside as being void, the Court may direct the minor to 
restore the property to the other party. 
 
 For example, a minor fraudulently overstates his age and takes delivery of a motor car after 
executing a promissory note in favour of the trader for its price. The minor cannot be compelled to 
pay the amount to the promissory note, but the Court on equitable grounds may order the minor to 
EP-EBCL 
488 
return the car to the trader, if it is still with the minor. 
 
 Thus, according to Section 33 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 the Court may, if the minor has 
received any benefit under the agreement from the other party require him to restore, so far as may 
be such benefit to the other party, to the extent to which he or his estate has been benefited 
thereby. 
 
(d) A minors estate is liable to pay a reasonable price for necessaries supplied to him or to anyone 
whom the minor is bound to support (Section 68 of the Act). 
 
 The necessaries supplied must be according to the position and status in life of the minor and must 
be things which the minor actually needs. The following have also been held as necessaries in 
India. 
 
 Costs incurred in successfully defending a suit on behalf of a minor in which his property was in 
jeopardy; costs incurred in defending him in a prosecution; and money advanced to a Hindu minor 
to meet his marriage expenses have been held to be necessaries. 
 
(e) An agreement by a minor being void, the Court will never direct specific performance of the 
contract. 
 
(f) A minor can be an agent, but he cannot be a principal nor can he be a partner. He can, however, be 
admitted to the benefits of a partnership. 
 
(g) Since a minor is never personally liable, he cannot be adjudicated as an insolvent. 
 
(h) An agreement by a parent or guardian entered into on behalf of the minor is binding on him 
provided it is for his benefit or is for legal necessity. For, the guardian of a minor, may enter into 
contract for marriage on behalf of the minor, and such a contract would be good in law and an 
action for its breach would lie, if the contract is for the benefit of the minor (Rose Fernandez v. 
Joseph Gonsalves, 48 Bom. L. R. 673) e.g., if the parties are of the community among whom it is 
customary for parents to contract marriage for their children. The contract of apprenticeship is also 
binding. 
 
 However, it has been held that an agreement for service, entered into by a father on behalf of his 
daughter who is a minor, is not enforceable at law (Raj Rani v. PremAdib, (1948) 51 Bom. L.R. 
256). 
Lunatics Agreement (Section 2) 
A person of unsound mind is a lunatic. That is to say for the purposes of making contract, a person is of 
unsound mind if at the time when he makes the contract, he is incapable of understanding it and of forming 
rational judgment as to its effect upon his interests. 
A person of unsound mind cannot enter into a contract. A lunatics agreement is therefore void. But if he 
makes a contract when he is of sound mind, i.e., during lucid intervals, he will be bound by it. 
A sane man who is delirious from fever, or who is so drunk that he cannot understand the terms of a 
contract, or form a rational judgement as to its effect on his interests cannot contract whilst such delirium or 
state of drunkenness lasts. A person under the influence of hypnotism is temporarily of unsound mind. 
Mental decay brought by old age or disease also comes within the definition. 
Agreement by persons of unsound mind are void. But for necessaries supplied to a lunatic or to any member 
of his family, the lunatics estate, if any, will be liable. There is no personal liability incurred by the lunatic. 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
489 
If a contract entered into by a lunatic or person of unsound mind is for his benefit, it can be enforced (for the 
benefit) against the other party but not vice-versa (Jugal Kishore v. Cheddu, (1903) l All. L.J 43). 
Persons Disqualified from Entering into Contract 
Some statues disqualify certain persons governed by them, to enter into a contract. For example, Oudh Land 
Revenue Act provides that where a person in Oudh is declared as a ‘disqualified proprietor under the Act, he 
is incompetent to alienate his property. 
Alien Enemies 
A person who is not an Indian citizen is an alien. An alien may be either an alien friend or a foreigner whose 
sovereign or State is at peace with India, has usually contractual capacity of an Indian citizen. On the 
declaration of war between his country and India he becomes an alien enemy. A contract with an alien 
enemy becomes unenforceable on the outbreak of war. 
For the purposes of civil rights, an Indian citizen of the subject of a neutral state who is voluntarily resident in 
hostile territory or is carrying on business there is an alien enemy. Trading with an alien enemy is considered 
illegal, being against public policy. 
Foreign Sovereigns and Ambassadors 
Foreign sovereigns and accredited representatives of foreign states, i.e., Ambassadors, High 
Commissioners, enjoy a special privilege in that they cannot be sued in Indian Courts, unless they voluntarily 
submit to the jurisdiction of the Indian Courts. Foreign Sovereign Governments can enter into contracts 
through agents residing in India. In such cases the agent becomes personally responsible for the 
performance of the contracts. 
Professional Persons 
In England, barristers-at law are prohibited by the etiquette of their profession from suing for their fees. So 
also are the Fellow and Members of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons. But they can sue and be 
sued for all claims other than their professional fees. In India, there is no such disability and a barrister, who 
is in the position of an advocate with liberty both to act and plead, has a right to contract and to sue for his 
fees (Nihal Chand v. Dilawar Khan, 1933 All. L.R. 417). 
Corporations 
A corporation is an artificial person created by law, e.g., a company registered under the Companies Act, 
public bodies created by statute, such as Municipal Corporation of Delhi. A corporation exists only in 
contemplation of law and has no physical shape or form. 
The Indian Contract Act does not speak about the capacity of a corporation to enter into a contract. But if 
properly incorporated, it has a right to enter into a contract. It can sue and can be sued in its own name. 
There are some contracts into which a corporation cannot enter without its seal, and others not at all. A 
company, for instance, cannot contract to marry. Further, its capacity and powers to contract are limited by 
its charter or memorandum of association. Any contract beyond such power in ultra vires and void. 
Married Women 
In India there is no difference between a man and a woman regarding contractual capacity. A woman 
married or single can enter into contracts in the same ways as a man. She can deal with her property in any 
manner she likes, provided, of course, she is a major and is of sound mind. 
EP-EBCL 
490 
Under the English law, before the passing of the Law Reform (Married Women and Tortfeasors) Act, 1935, a 
husband was responsible for his wifes contracts but since 1935 this liability no longer arises unless the wife 
is acting as the husbands agent. Now, therefore, even in England a married woman has full contractual 
capacity, and can sue and be sued in her own name. 
Flaw in Consent 
The basis of a contract is agreement, i.e., mutual consent. In other words, the parties should mean the 
something in the same sense and agree voluntarily. It is when there is consent, that the parties are said to be 
consensus ad idem i.e. their minds have met. Not only consent is required but it must be a free consent. 
Consent is not free when it has been caused by coercion, undue influence, misrepresentation, fraud or 
mistake. These elements if present, may vitiate the contract. 
When this consent is wanting, the contract may turn out to be void or voidable according to the nature of the flaw 
in consent. Where there is no consent, there can be no contract as in the case of mutual mistake. Where there is 
consent, but it is not free, a contract is generally voidable at the option of the party whose consent is not free. In 
the case of misrepresentation, fraud, coercion, undue influence, the consent of one of the parties is induced or 
caused by the supposed existence of a fact which did not exist. 
(ii) Mistake (Sections 20 and 21) 
The law believes that contracts are made to be performed. The whole structure of business depends on this 
as the businessmen depend on the validity of contracts. Accordingly, the law says that it will not aid any one 
to evade consequences on the plea that he was mistaken. 
On the other hand, the law also realises that mistakes do occur, and that these mistakes are so fundamental 
that there may be no contract at all. If the law recognises mistake in contract, the mistake will render the 
contract void. 
Effect of Mistake 
A mistake in the nature of miscalculation or error of judgement by one or both the parties has no effect on the 
validity of the contract. For example, if A pays an excessive price for goods under a mistake as to their true 
value, the contract is binding on him (Leaf v. International Galleries (1950) 1 All E.R. 693). 
Therefore, mistake must be a “vital operative mistake”, i.e. it must be a mistake of fact which is fundamental 
to contract. 
To be operative so as to render the contract void, the mistake must be: 
 
(a) of fact, and not of law or opinion; 
 
(b) the fact must be essential to agreement, i.e., so fundamental as to negative the agreement; and 
 
(c) must be on the part of both the parties. 
Thus, where both the parties to an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to 
agreement, the agreement is void (Section 20). Such a mistake prevents the formation of any contract at all 
and the Court will declare it void. For example, A agrees to buy from B a certain horse. It turns out that the 
horse was dead at the time of bargain though neither party was aware of the fact. The agreement is void. 
Mistake of Law and Mistake of Fact 
Mistakes are of two kinds: (i) mistake of law, and (ii) mistake of fact. If there is a mistake of law of the land, 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
491 
the contract is binding because everyone is deemed to have knowledge of law of the land and ignorance of 
law is no excuse (ignorantia juris non-excusat). 
But mistake of foreign law and mistake of private rights are treated as mistakes of fact and are execusable. 
The law of a foreign country is to be proved in Indian Courts as ordinary facts. So mistake of foreign law 
makes the contract void. Similarly, if a contract is made in ignorance of private right of a party, it would be 
void, e.g., where A buys property which already belongs to him. 
Mutual or Unilateral Mistake 
Mistake must be mutual or bilateral, i.e., it must be on the part of both parties. A unilateral mistake, i.e., 
mistake on the part of only one party, is generally of no effect unless (i) it concerns some fundamental fact 
and (ii) the other party is aware of the mistake. For this reason, error of judgement on the part of one of the 
parties has no effect and the contract will be valid. 
Mutual or Common Mistake as to Subject-matter 
A contract is void when the parties to it assume that a certain state of things exist which does not actually 
exist or in their ignorance the contract means one thing to one and another thing to the other, and they 
contract subject to that assumption or under that ignorance. There is a mistake on the part of both the 
parties. Such a mistake may relate to the existence of the subject matter, its identity, quantity or quality. 
 
(a) Mistake as to existence of the subject matter: Where both parties believe the subject matter of the 
contract to be in existence but in fact, it is not in existence at the time of making the contract, there 
is mistake and the contract is void. 
 
 In Couturier v. Hastie (1856), there was a contact to buy cargo described as shipped from port A to 
port B and believed to be at sea which in fact got lost earlier unknown to the parties and hence not 
in existence at the time of the contract. Held, the contract was void due to the parties mistake. 
 
(b) Mistake as to identity of the subject matter: Where the parties are not in agreement to the identity of 
the subject matter, i.e., one means one thing and the other means another thing, the contract is 
void; there is no consensus ad idem. 
 
 In Raffles v. Wichelhhaks (1864), A agreed to buy from B a cargo of cotton to arrive “ex Peerless 
from Bombay”. There were two ships called “Peerless” sailing from Bombay, one arriving in October 
and the other in December. A meant the earlier ship and B the latter. Held, the contract was void for 
mistake. 
 
(c) Mistake as to quantity of the subject matter: There may be a mistake as to quantity or extent of the 
subject matter which will render the contract void even if the mistake was caused by the negligence 
of a third-party. 
 
 In Henkel v. Pape (1870), P wrote to H inquiring the price of rifles and suggested that he might buy 
as many as fifty. On receipt of a reply he wired send three rifles. Due to the mistake of the telegraph 
clerk the message transmitted to H was send the rifles. H despatched 50 rifles. Held, there was no 
contract between the parties. 
 
(d) Mistake as to quality of the subject-matter or promise: Mistake as to quality raises difficult questions. 
If the mistake is on the part of both the parties the contract is void. But if the mistake is only on the 
part of one party difficulty arises. 
The general rule is that a party to a contract does not owe any duty to the other party to discloses all the 
facts in his possession during negotiations. Even if he knows that the other party is ignorant of or under 
EP-EBCL 
492 
some misapprehension as to an important fact, he is under no obligation to enlighten him. Each party must 
protect his own interests unaided. In contract of sale of goods, this rule is summed up in the maxim caveat 
emptor (Let the buyer beware.) The seller is under no duty to reveal the defects of his goods to the buyer, 
subject to certain conditions. 
Unilateral Mistake as to Nature of the Contract 
The general rule is that a person who signs an instrument is bound by its terms even if he has not read it. But 
a person who signs a document under a fundamental mistake as to its nature (not merely as to its contents) 
may have it avoided provided the mistake was due to either- 
 
(a) the blindness, illiteracy, or senility of the person signing, or 
 
(b) a trick or fraudulent misrepresentation as to the nature of the document. 
Unilateral Mistake as to the Identity of the Person Contracted With 
It is a rule of law that if a person intends to contract with A, B cannot give himself any right under it. Hence, 
when a contract is made in which personalities of the contracting parties are or may be of importance, no 
other person can interpose and adopt the contract. For example, where M intends to contract only with A but 
enters into contract with B believing him to be A, the contract is vitiated by mistake as there is no consensus 
ad idem.  
Mistake as to the identity of the person with whom the contract is made will operate to nullify the contract 
only if: 
 
(i) the identity is for material importance to the contracts; and 
 
(ii) the mistake is known to the other person, i.e., he knows that it is not intended that he should 
become a party to the contract. 
In Cundy  v. Lindsay [(1878) 3 A.C. 459, one Blenkarn posing as a reputed trader Blankiron, placed an order for 
some goods with M/s Lindsay and Co. The company, thought that it is dealing with Blankiron and supplied the 
goods. Blenkarn sold the goods to Cundy and did not pay to Lindsay. The latter sued Cundy. The Court held 
that there was no contract between Lindsay and Blenkarn and therefore Cundy has no title to the goods. 
(iii) Misrepresentation(Section 18) 
The term “misrepresentation” is ordinarily used to connote both “innocent misrepresentation” and “dishonest 
misrepresentation”. Misrepresentation may, therefore, be either (i) Innocent misrepresentation, or (ii) Wilful 
misrepresentation with intent to deceive and is called fraud. 
Innocent Misrepresentation 
If a person makes a representation believing what he says is true he commits innocent misrepresentation. 
Thus, any false representation, which is made with an honest belief in its truth is innocent. The effect of 
innocent misrepresentation is that the party misled by it can avoid the contract, but cannot sue for damages 
in the normal circumstances. 
But in order to avoid a contract on the ground of misrepresentation, it is necessary to prove that: 
 
(i) there was a representation or assertion, 
 
(ii) such assertion induced the party aggrieved to enter into the contract. 
 
(iii) the assertion related to a matter of fact ( and not of law as ignorance of law is no excuse). 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
493 
 
(iv) the statement was not a mere opinion or hearsay, or commendation (i.e., reasonable praise). For 
example an advertisement saying, “washes whiter than the whitest". 
 
(v) the statement which has become or turned out to be untrue, was made with an honest belief in its 
truth. 
Damages for Innocent Misrepresentation 
Generally the injured party can only avoid the contract and cannot get damages for innocent 
misrepresentation. But in the following cases, damages are obtainable: 
 
(i) From a promoter or director who makes innocent misrepresentation in a company prospectus 
inviting the public to subscribe for the shares in the company; 
 
(ii) Against an agent who commits a breach of warranty of authority: 
 
(iii) From a person who (at the Courts discretion) is estopped from denying a statement he has made 
where he made a positive statement intending that it should be relied upon and the innocent party 
did rely upon it and thereby suffered damages; 
 
(iv) Negligent representation made by one person to another between whom a confidential relationship, 
like that of a solicitor and client exists.  
(iv) Wilful Misrepresentation or Fraud(Section 17) 
Fraud is an untrue statement made knowingly or without belief in its truth or recklessly, carelessly, whether it 
be true or false with the intent to deceive. The chief ingredients of a fraud are: 
 
(i) a false representation or assertion; 
 
(ii) of fact (and not a mere opinion), 
 
(iii) made with the intention that it should be acted upon, 
 
(iv) the representation must have actually induced the other party to enter into the contract and so 
deceived him, 
 
(v) the party deceived must thereby be damnified, for there is no fraud without damages, and 
 
(vi) the statement must have been made either with the knowledge that it was false or without belief in 
its truth or recklessly without caring whether it was true or false. 
It is immaterial whether the representation takes effect by false statement or with concealment. The party 
defrauded can avoid the contract and also claim damages. 
Mere silence as to facts likely to affect the willingness of a person to enter into a contract is not fraud, unless 
silence is in itself equivalent to speech, or where it is the duty of the person keeping silent to speak as in the 
cases of contracts uberrimaefidei- (contracts requiring utmost good faith). 
Contracts Uberrimae Fidei 
There are contracts in which the law imposes a special duty to act with the utmost good faith i.e., to disclose 
all material information. Failure to disclose such information will render the contract voidable at the option of 
the other party. 
Contracts uberrimaefidei are: 
 
(a) Contract of insurance of all kinds: The assured must disclose to the insurer all material facts and 
EP-EBCL 
494 
whatever he states must be correct and truthful. 
 
(b) Company prospectus: When a company invites the public to subscribe for its shares, it is under 
statutory obligation to disclose truthfully the various matters set out in the Companies Act. Any 
person responsible for non-disclosure of any of these matters is liable to damages. Also, the 
contract to buy shares is voidable where there is a material false statement or non- disclosure in the 
prospectus. 
 
(c) Contract for the sale of land: The vendor is under a duty to the purchaser to show good title to the 
land he has contracted to sell. 
 
(d) Contracts of family arrangements: When the members of a family make agreements or 
arrangements for the settlement of family property, each member of the family must make full 
disclosure of every material fact within his knowledge. 
Difference between Fraud and Innocent Misrepresentation 
 
1. Fraud implies an intent to deceive, which is lacking if it is innocent misrepresentation. 
 
2. In case of misrepresentation and fraudulent silence, the defendant can take a good plea that the 
plaintiff had the means of discovering the truth with ordinary diligence. This argument is not 
available if there is fraud (Section 19- exception). 
 
3. In misrepresentation the plaintiff can avoid or rescind the contract. In fraud, the plaintiff can claim 
damages as well. 
 
4. If there is fraud, it may lead to prosecution for an offence of cheating under the Indian Penal Code. 
(v) Coercion  
Coercion as defined in Section 15 means “the committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the 
Indian Penal Code, or unlawful detaining or threatening to detain, any property to the prejudice of any person 
whatever with the intention of causing any person to enter into an agreement”. Simply stated, the doing of 
any act forbidden by the Indian Penal Code is coercion even though such an act is done in a place where the 
Indian Penal Code is not in force. If A at the point of a pistol asks B to execute a promissory note in his 
favour and B to save his life does so he can avoid this agreement as his consent was not free. Even a threat 
to third-party, e.g., where A compels B to sign a document threatening to harm C, in case B does not sign 
would also amount to coercion. 
It has been held that mere threat by one person to another to prosecute him does not amount to coercion. 
There must be a contract made under the threat and that contract should be one sought to be avoided 
because of coercion (Ramchandra v. Bank of Kohlapur, 1952 Bom. 715). It may be pointed out that coercion 
may proceed from any person and may be directed against any person, even a stranger and also against 
goods, e.g., by unlawful detention of goods. 
(vi) Undue Influence 
Under Section 16 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, a contract is said to be produced by undue influence 
“where the relations subsisting between the parties are such that one of the parties is in a position to 
dominate the will of the other and uses that position to obtain an unfair advantage over the other”. 
The elements of undue influence are (i) a dominant position, and (ii) the use of it to obtain an unfair 
advantage. The words “unfair advantage” do not limit the jurisdiction to cases where the transaction would be 
obviously unfair as between persons dealing on an equal footing. In the words of Lord Kingston, “the 
principle applies to every case where influence is acquired and abused where confidence is reposed and 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
495 
betrayed”. 
Sub-section (2) of Section 16 provides that a person is deemed to be in a position to dominate the will of 
another— 
 
(a) Where he holds a real or apparent authority over the other or where he stands in a fiduciary relation 
to the other, e.g., minor and guardian; trustee and beneficiary; solicitor and client. There is, 
however, no presumption of undue influence in the relation of creditor and debtor, husband and wife 
(unless the wife is a parda-nishin woman) and landlord and tenant. In these cases the party has to 
prove that undue influence has been exercised on him, there being no presumption as to existence 
of undue influence. 
 
(b) Where he makes a contract with a person whose mental capacity is temporarily or permanently 
affected by reason of age, illness or mental or bodily distress e.g., doctor and patient. 
Illustration 
A, having advanced money to his son B, during his minority, upon B’s coming of age obtains, by misuse of 
parental influence a bond upon B for a greater amount than the sum due in respect of the advance. A 
employs undue influence. 
A, a man enfeebled by disease or age is induced by B’s influence over him as his medical attendant, to 
agree to pay B an unreasonable sum for his professional services. B employs undue influence. 
A parent stands in a fiduciary relation towards his child and any transaction between them by which any 
benefit is procured by the parent to himself or to a third party, at the expense of the child will be viewed with 
jealousy by Courts of Equity and the burden will be on the parent or third-party claiming the benefit of 
showing that the child while entering into the transaction had independent advice, that he thoroughly 
understood the nature of transaction and that he was removed from all undue influence when the gift was 
made (Marim Bibi v. Cassim Ebrahim (1939) 184 I.C. 171 (1939) A.I.R. 278). 
Where there is a presumption of undue influence, the presumption can be rebutted by showing that 
 
(i) full disclosure of all material facts was made, 
 
(ii) the consideration was adequate, and 
 
(iii) the weaker party was in receipt of independent legal advice. 
Transaction with parda-nishin women 
The expression ‘parda-nishin denotes complete seclusion. Thus, a woman who goes to a Court and gives 
evidence, who fixes rents with tenants and collects rents, who communicates when necessary, in matters of 
business, with men other than members of her own family, could not be regarded as a parda-nishin woman 
(Ismail Musafee v. Hafiz Boo (1906) 33 Cal. LR 773 and 33 I.A. 86). The principles to be applied to 
transactions with parda-nishin woman are founded on equity and good conscience and accordingly a person 
who contracts with parda-nishin woman has to prove that no undue influence was used and that she had free 
and independent advice, fully understood the contents of the contract and exercised her free will. “The law 
throws around her a special cloak of protection” (Kali Baksh v. Ram Gopal (1914) L.R. 41 I.A. 23, 28-29, 36 
All 81, 89). 
Unconscionable transactions: An unconscionable transaction is one which makes an exorbitant profit of the 
others distress by a person who is in a dominant position. Merely the fact that the rate of interest is very high 
in a money lending transaction shall not make it unconscionable. But if the rate of interest is very exorbitant 
EP-EBCL 
496 
and the Court regards the transaction unconscionable, the burden of proving that no undue influence was 
exercised lies on the creditor. It has been held that urgent need of money on the part of the borrower does 
not itself place the lender in a position to dominate his will within the meaning of this Section (Sunder Koerv. 
Rai Sham Krishen (1907) 34 Cal. 150, C.R. 34 I.A. 9). 
(vii) Legality of Object 
One of the requisites of a valid contract is that the object should be lawful. Section 10 of the Indian Contract 
Act, 1872, provides, “All agreements are contracts if they are made by free consent of parties competent to 
contract for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object...” Therefore, it follows that where the 
consideration or object for which an agreement is made is unlawful, it is not a contract. 
Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 provides that the consideration or object of an agreement is 
lawful unless it is 
 
(i) forbidden by law; or 
 
(ii) it is of such nature that if permitted it would defeat the provisions of law; or 
 
(iii) is fraudulent; or 
 
(iv) involves or implies injury to the person or property of another; or 
 
(v) the Court regards it an immoral or opposed to public policy. 
In each of these cases the consideration or object of an agreement is said to be unlawful. Every agreement 
of which the object or consideration is unlawful is void. 
Illustration 
 
(i) X, Y and Z enter into an agreement for the division among them of gains acquired by them by fraud. 
The agreement is void as its object is unlawful. 
 
(ii) X promises to obtain for Y an employment in the Government service and Y promises to pay Rs. 
1,500 to X. The agreement is void, as the consideration for it is unlawful. 
 
(iii) X promises to Y to drop a prosecution which he has instituted against Y for robbery, and Y promises 
to restore the value of the things taken. The agreement is void as its object is unlawful. 
 
(iv) A who is B’s mukhtr promises to exercise his influence, as such, with B in favour of C and C 
promises to pay Rs. 1,000 to A. The agreement is void because it is immoral. 
 
(v) An agreement by the proprietors of a newspaper to indemnify the printers against claims arising 
from libels printed in the newspaper is void as it implies or involves injury to the person of another. 
Void and Illegal Contracts 
A void contract is one which is destitue of legal effects altogether. An illegal contract too has no legal effect 
as between the immediate parties to the contract, but has the further effect of tainting the collateral contracts 
also with illegality. For instance A borrows from B `1,000 for lending to C a minor. The contract between A 
and C is void, but B can nevertheless recover the money from A, On the other hand, if A had borrowed 
`1,000 from B to buy a pistol to shoot C, the question whether B can recover the money hinges on whether B 
was aware of the purpose for which money was borrowed. If B had knowledge of the illegal purpose, he 
cannot recover. Therefore, it may be said that all illegal agreements are void but all void agreements are not 
necessarily illegal. 
Consequence of Illegal Agreements 
 
(i) an illegal agreement is entirely void; 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
497 
 
(ii) no action can be brought by a party to an illegal agreement. The maxim is “Ex turpi cause non-oritur 
action” - from an evil cause, no action arises; 
 
(iii) money paid or property transferred under an illegal agreement cannot be recovered. The maxim is 
in parti delicto potierest condition defendeties- In cases of equal guilt, more powerful is the condition 
of the defendant; 
 
(iv) where an agreement consist of two parts, one part legal and other illegal, and the legal parts is 
separable from the illegal one, then the Court will enforce the legal one. If the legal and the illegal 
parts cannot be separated the whole agreement is illegal; and 
 
(v) any agreement which is collateral to an illegal agreement is also tainted with illegality and is treated 
as being illegal, even though it would have been lawful by itself (Film Pratapchand v. Firm Kotri Re. 
AIR (1975) S.C. 1223). 
Exception to General Rule of no Recovery of Money or Property 
In the following cases, a party to an illegal agreement may sue to recover money paid or property transferred: 
 
(a) Where the transfer is not in pari delicto (equally guilty) with the defendant, i.e. the transferee. For 
example, where A is induced to enter into an illegal agreement by the fraud of B, A may recover the 
money paid if he did not know that the contract was illegal. 
 
(b) If the plaintiff can frame a cause of action entirely dependent of the contract. 
 
(c) Where a substantial part of the illegal transaction has not been carried out and the plaintiff is truly 
and genuinely repentant. (Bigos v. Bonstead(1951), All E.R. 92). 
Agreements Void as being Opposed to Public Policy 
The head public policy covers a wide range of topics. Agreements may offend public policy by tending to the 
prejudice of the State in times of war, by tending to the abuse of justice or by trying to impose unreasonable 
and inconvenient restrictions on the free choice of individuals in marriage, or their liberty to exercise lawful 
trade or calling. The doctrine of public policy is a branch of Common Law and like any other branch of 
Common Law it is governed by the precedents [Gherulal Parakh v. MahadeodasMaiya (1959) 2 S.C.R. 
(Suppl.) 406; AIR 1959 S.C. 781]. The doctrine of public policy is not to be extended beyond the classes of 
cases already covered by it and no Court can invent a new head of public policy [Lord Halsbury, Janson v. 
Driefontien Consolidated Mines (1902) A.C. 484, 491]. It has been said by the House of Lords that public 
policy is always an unsafe and treacherous ground for legal decisions. Even if it is possible for Courts to 
evolve a new head of public policy, it should be done under extraordinary circumstances giving rise to 
incontestable harm to the society. 
The following agreements are void as being against public policy but they are not illegal: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Agreement in restrain 
of parental rights 
Agreement in 
restraint of 
trade 
Agreement in 
restraint of 
marriage 
Agreements in 
restraint of 
personal 
freedom are void 
Marriage 
brocage or 
brokerage 
Agreements 
EP-EBCL 
498 
 
(a) Agreement in restrain of parental rights: An agreement by which a party deprives himself of the 
custody of his child is void. 
 
(b) Agreement in restraint of marriage: An agreement not to marry at all or not to marry any particular 
person or class of persons is void as it is in restraint of marriage. 
 
(c) Marriage brokerage or brokerage Agreements: An agreement to procure marriage for reward is 
void. Where a purohit (priest) was promised Rs. 200 in consideration of procuring a wife for the 
defendant, the promise was held void as opposed to public policy, and the purohit could not recover 
the promised sum. 
 
(d) Agreements in restraint of personal freedom are void: Where a man agreed with his money lender not 
to change his residence, or his employment or to part with any of his property or to incur any obligation 
on credit without the consent of the money lender, it was held that the agreement was void. 
 
(e) Agreement in restraint of trade: An agreement in restraint of trade is one which seeks to restrict a 
person from freely exercising his trade or profession. 
AGREEMENTS IN RESTRAINT OF TRADE VOID 
Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act states that every agreement by which any one is restrained from 
exercising a lawful profession, trade or business of any kind, is, to that extent, void. 
This Section is not happily worded and has been criticised by many authors. It appears from the wording that 
every kind of restraint, whether total or partial falls within the prohibition of this Section. In English law the 
Courts have held that if a restraint is reasonable, it will be valid. Leading case on his point is Nordenfelt v. 
Maxim Nordenfelt Guns Co., (1894) A.C. 535. N was an inventor and a manufacturer of guns and 
ammunition. He sold his world-wide business to M and promised not to manufacture guns anywhere in the 
world for 25 years. The House of Lords held that the restraint was reasonable as it was no more than is 
necessary for the protection of the company, the contract was binding. Whether a restraint is reasonable or 
not depends upon the facts of each case. 
Our courts are not consistent on the point whether reasonable restraints are permitted or not. In Madhub 
Chunder v. RaCoomar(1874) 14 Bang. L.R. 76, A paid Rs. 900 to B’s workman. B undertook to stop his 
business in a particular locality in Calcutta. He did not keep his promise. A’s suit for the sum was dismissed 
since the agreement was void under Section 27. The reasonableness or otherwise of the restraint was not 
discussed. However, if a restrictive meaning is adopted, most of the ordinary mercantile agreements may be 
hit. Thus, the Courts have held that if the restraint is one which is really necessary for the carrying on 
business, the same is not prohibited. In Mackenzie v. Sitarmiah, (1891) 15 Mad. 79, A agreed to sell to B all 
the salt he manufactured and B agreed to buy such salt. A further agreed not to sell salt to third-parties. The 
Court held that the agreement was valid. 
Other type of restrains is personal covenants between an employer and his employee whereby the latter 
agrees not to compete with the former or serve with any of his competitors after employment. This issue 
came before the Supreme Court in Niranjan Shanker Golikari v. The Century Spinning and Manufacturing 
Co. Ltd., AIR 1967 S.C. 1098. In this case N entered into a bond with the company to serve for a period of 
five years. In case, N leaves his job earlier and joins elsewhere with companys competitor within five years, 
he was liable for damages. N was imparted the necessary training but he left the job and joined another 
company. The former employer instituted a suit against N. The Supreme Court, held that the restraint was 
necessary for the protection of the companys interests and not such as the Court would refuse to enforce. 
In other case, it has been reiterated that the restriction should be reasonable taking into account the facts 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
499 
and circumstances of the case. In Superintendence Company of India Ltd. v. Krishna Murgai [(1981) 2 SCC 
246], the Supreme Court laid down that a restraint beyond the term of service would be void and the only 
ground on which it can be justified is by showing it is necessary for the protection of the employers goodwill. 
The words “to the extent” in Section 27 make it clear that if in an agreement there are some convenants 
which are prohibited whereas the others are not and if the two parts can be separated then only those 
convenants which operate as restraint of trade would be void and not whole of the agreement itself. To 
illustrate, in Brahmputra Tea Co. Ltd. v. Scarth(1885) I.L.R. Cal. 545, the employee agreed with the employer 
firstly, not to compete with latter after leaving the job and, secondly, not to injure employer’s interest during 
employment. The Court held that the first condition is a restraint of trade but the second is binding. 
When Contracts in Restraint of Trade Valid 
Prima facie every restraint of trade is void , but certain exceptions to this general rule are recognised. If a 
partial and reasonable restraint falls under any of the following exceptions, the contract will be enforceable: 
 
(a) Sale of goodwill: Where the seller of the goodwill of a business undertakes not to compete with the 
purchaser of the goodwill, the contract is enforceable provided the restraint appears to be 
reasonable as to territorial limits and the length of time. 
 
(b) Partners agreements: Section 11(2) of the Indian Partnership Act permits contracts between 
partners to provide that a partner shall not carry on any business other than that of the firm while he 
is a partner. 
 
(c) Section 36(2) and Section 54 of the Indian Partnership Act provide that a partner may make an 
agreement with his partners that on ceasing to be a partner he will not carry on any business similar 
to that of the firm within specified period or within specified limits. The agreement shall be binding if 
the restrictions are reasonable. 
Trade Combinations: An agreement, the object of which is to regulate business and not to restrain it is valid. 
Thus, an agreement in the nature of a business combination between traders or manufactures e.g. not to sell 
their goods below a certain price, to pool profits or output and to divide the same in an agreed proportion 
does not amount to a restraint of trade and is perfectly valid (Fraster& Co. v. Laxmi Narain, (1931) 63 All 
316). 
Negative stipulations in service agreements: An agreement of service by which a person binds himself during 
the term of the agreement not to take service with anyone else is not in restraint of lawful profession and is 
valid. 
WAGERING AGREEMENTS 
The literal meaning of the word “wager” is a “bet”. Wagerning agreements are nothing but ordinary betting 
agreements. For example, A and B enter into an agreement that if Englands Cricket Team wins the test 
match, A will pay B Rs. 100 and if it loses B will pay Rs. 100 to A. This is a wagering agreement and nothing 
can be recovered by winning party under the agreement. 
The essence of gaming and wagering is that one party is to win and the other to lose upon a future event 
which at the time of the contract is of an uncertain nature that is to say, if the event turns out one way A will 
lose; but if it turns out the other way he will win (Thacker v. Hardy, (1878) 4 OBD 685). 
Wagering Agreements Void 
In India except Mumbai, wagering agreements are void. In Mumbai, wagering agreements have been 
EP-EBCL 
500 
declared illegal by the Avoiding Wagers (Amendment) Act, 1865. Therefore, in Mumbai a wagering 
agreement being illegal, is void not only between the immediate parties, but taints and renders void all 
collateral agreements to it. 
Thus, A bets with B and losses, applies to C for a loan, who pays B in settlement of A’s losses. C cannot 
recover from A because this is money paid “under” or “in respect of” a wagering transaction which is illegal in 
Mumbai. But in respect of India such a transaction (i.e., betting) being only void, C could recover from A. Of 
course, if A refused to pay B the amount of the bet that he has lost, B could not sue A anywhere. Again, 
where an agent bets on behalf of his principal and looses and pays over the money to the winner, he cannot 
recover the money from his principal, if the transactions took place in Mumbai, but elsewhere he could 
recover. But if the agent wins, he must pay the winnings to the principal, as this money was received on 
behalf of the principal. 
Sometimes, commercial transactions assume the form of wagering contracts. The sample test to find out 
whether a particular transaction is a wager or a genuine commercial transaction is: “Where delivery of the 
goods sold is intended to be given and taken, it is valid contract, but where only the differences are intended 
to be paid, it will be a wagering contract and unenforceable”. 
In a wagering contract there must be mutuality in the sense that the gain of one party should be loss to the 
other on the happening of an uncertain event which is the subject matter of the contract. 
VOID AGREEMENTS 
The following types of agreements are void under Indian Contract Act: 
 
(a) Agreement by or with a minor or a person of unsound mind or a person disqualified to enter into a 
contract - Section 11; 
 
(b) Agreement made under a mistake of fact, material to the agreement on the part of the both the 
parties - Section 20. 
 
(c) An agreement of which the consideration or object is unlawful - Section 23. 
 
(d) If any part of a single consideration for one or more objects, or any one or any part of any one of

501 
A contract which ceases to be enforceable by law becomes void when it ceases to be enforceable - Section 2(j) 
A contract becomes void when, by reason of some event which the promisor could not prevent, the 
performance of the contract becomes impossible, e.g., by destruction of the subject- matter of the contract 
after the formation of the contract. 
A contract becomes void by reason of subsequent illegality. A in India agrees to supply goods to B in 
Pakistan. After the formation of the contract war breaks out between India and Pakistan and the supply of 
goods to Pakistan is prohibited by legislation. The contract becomes void. 
A contingent contract to do or not do to anything if an uncertain future event happens becomes void if the 
event becomes impossible. 
Where a contract is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party, the contract becomes void when the option 
is exercised by him. 
RESTITUTION 
When a contract becomes void, it is not to be performed by either party. But if any party has received any 
benefit under such a contract from the other party he must restore it or make compensation for it to the other 
party. A agrees to sell to B after 6 months a certain quantity of gold and receives `500 as advance. Soon 
after the agreement, private sales of gold are prohibited by law. The contract becomes void and A must 
return the sum of `500 to B. 
Restitution is also provided for by Section 65 where an agreement is discovered to be void. A pays `500 in 
consideration of B’s promising to marry, C, A’s daughter C is dead at the time of the promise. The agreement 
is discovered to be void and B must pay back `500. 
But there is no resolution where the parties are wholly incompetent to contract, e.g., where one of the parties 
is a minor. The minor cannot be asked to restore the benefit, e.g., a minor borrowed `1,000 from B, he 
cannot be asked to pay back `1,000 to B because the contract is void (Mohori Bibis case). 
CONTINGENT CONTRACT (Section 31) 
As per Section 31, a contingent contract is a contract to do or not to do something, if some event collateral to 
such contract, does or does not happen. For example, A contracts to sell B 10 bales of cotton for Rs. 20,000, 
if the ship by which they are coming returns safely. This is a contingent contract. 
Contract of insurance and contracts of indemnity and guarantee are popular instances of contingent 
contracts. 
Rules regarding contingent contracts 
The following rules are contained in Section 32-36: 
 
(a) Contracts contingent upon the happening of a future uncertain event cannot be enforced by law 
unless and until that event has happened. If the event becomes impossible, the contract becomes 
void - Section 32. 
 
(i) A makes a contract to buy B’s house if A survives C. This contract cannot be enforced by law 
unless and until C dies in A’s lifetime. 
 
(ii) A contracts to pay B a sum of money when B marries C, C dies without being married to B. The 
contract becomes void. 
EP-EBCL 
502 
 
(b) Contracts contingent upon the non-happening of an uncertain future event can be enforced when 
the happening of that event becomes impossible and not before - Section 33. 
 
 A contracts to pay B a certain sum of money if a certain ship does not return. The ship is sunk. The 
contract can be enforced when the ship sinks. 
 
(c) If a contract is contingent upon how a person will act at an unspecified time, the event shall be 
considered to become impossible when such person does anything which renders it impossible that 
he should so act within any definite time or otherwise than under further contingencies - Section 34. 
 
 A agrees to pay B Rs. 1,000 if B marries C. C marries D. The marriage of B to C must now be 
considered impossible although it is possible that D may die and C may afterwards marry B. 
 
(d) Contracts contingent on the happening of an event within a fixed time become void if, at the 
expiration of the time, such event has not happened, or if, before the time fixed, such event 
becomes impossible - Section 35. 
 
 A promises to pay B a sum of money if a certain ship returns with in a year. The contract may be 
enforced if the ship returns within the year, and becomes void if the ship is burnt within the year. 
 
(e) Contracts contingent upon the non-happening of an event within a fixed time may be enforced by 
law when the time fixed has expired and such event has not happened or before the time fixed has 
expired, if it becomes certain that such event will not happen - Section 35 
 
 A promises to pay B a sum of money if a certain ship does not return within the year. The contract 
may be enforced if the ship does not return within the year or is burnt within the year. 
 
(f) Contingent agreements to do or not to do anything if an impossible event happens, are void, whether 
the impossibility of the event is known or not known to the parties to the agreement at the time when it 
is made - Section 36. 
 
 A agrees to pay Rs. 1,000 to B if two straight lines should enclose a space. The agreement is void. 
CERTAIN RELATIONS RESEMBLING THOSE OF CONTRACT (QUASI CONTRACTS) 
 
Nature of Quasi-Contracts 
A valid contract must contain certain essential elements, such as offer and acceptance, capacity to contract, 
consideration and free consent. But sometimes the law implies a promise imposing obligations on one party 
and conferring right in favour of the other even when there is no offer, no acceptance, no consensus ad 
idem, and in fact, there is neither agreement nor promise. Such cases are not contracts in the strict sense, 
but the Court recognises them as relations resembling those of contracts and enforces them as if they were 
contracts, hence the term quasi- contracts (i.e., resembling a contract). 
A quasi-contract rests on the equitable principle that a person shall not be allowed to enrich himself unjustly 
at the expense of another. In truth, it is not a contract at all. It is an obligation which the law creates, in the 
absence of any agreement, when any person is in the possession of other persons money, or its equivalent, 
under such circumstances that in equity and good conscience he ought not to retain it, and which in justice 
and fairness belongs to another. It is the duty and not an agreement or intention which defines it. A very 
simple illustration is money paid under mistake. Equity demands that such money must be paid back. 
Quasi-Contracts or Implied Contracts under the Indian Contract Act 
The following types of quasi-contracts have been dealt within the Indian Contract Act— 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
503 
 
(a) Necessaries supplied to person incapable of contracting or to anyone whom he is illegally bound to 
support - Section 68. 
 
(b) Suit for money had and received - Section 69 and 72. 
 
(c) Quantum Meruit 
 
(d) Obligations of a finder of goods - Section 71. 
 
(e) Obligation of person enjoying benefit of a non-gratuitous act - Section 70 
Necessaries 
Contracts by minors and persons of unsound mind are void. However, Section 68 of the Indian Contract Act 
provides that their estates are liable to reimburse the trader, who supplies them with necessaries of life. 
Suit for money had and received 
The right to file a suit for the recovery of money may arise 
 
(a) Where the plaintiff paid money to the defendant (i) under a mistake, (ii) in pursuance of a contract 
the consideration for which has failed, or (iii) under coercion, oppression, extortion or other such 
means. 
 
 A debtor may recover, from a creditor the amount of an over-payment made to him by mistake. The 
mistake may be mistake of fact or a mistake of law. 
 
(b) Payment to third-party of money which another is bound to pay. For example, where A’s goods are 
wrongfully attached in order to realise arrears of Government revenue due by B, and A pays the 
amount to save his goods from being sold, he is entitled to recover the amount from B. 
 
(c) Money obtained by defendant from third-parties. For example, where an agent has obtained a 
secret commission or a fraudulent payment from a third-party, the principle can recover the amount 
from the agent. 
Quantum Meruit 
The expression “Quantum Meruit” literally means “as much as earned” or reasonable remuneration. It is used 
where a person claims reasonable remuneration for the services rendered by him when there was no 
express promise to pay the definite remuneration, Thus, the law implies reasonable compensation for the 
services rendered by a party if there are circumstances showing that these are to be paid for. 
The general rule is that where a party to a contract has not fully performed what the contract demands as a 
condition of payment, he cannot sue for payment for that which he has done. The contract has to be 
indivisible and the payment can be demanded only on the completion of the contract. 
But where one party who has performed part of his contract is prevented by the other from completing it, he 
may sue on a quantum meruit, for the value of what he has done. 
The claim on a quantum meruit arises when one party abandons the contract, or accepts the work done by 
another under a void contract. 
The party in default may also sue on a “quantum meruit” for what he has done if the contract is divisible and 
the other party has had the benefit of the part which has been performed. But if the contract is not divisible, 
the party at fault cannot claim the value of what he has done. 
EP-EBCL 
504 
Obligations of finder of lost goods 
The liability of a finder of goods belonging to someone else is that of a bailee. This means that he must take 
as much care of the goods as a man of ordinary prudence would take of his own goods of the same kind. So 
far as the real owner of the goods is concerned, the finder is only a bailee and must not appropriate the 
goods to his own use. If the owner is traced, he must return the goods to him. The finder is entitled to get the 
reward that may have been offered by the owner and also any expenses he may have incurred in protecting 
and preserving the property. 
Obligation of a person enjoying benefit of non-gratuitous act 
Section 70 of the Indian Contract Act provides that where a person lawfully does something for another 
person or delivers anything to him without any intention of doing so gratuitously and the other person accepts 
and enjoys the benefit thereof, the latter must compensate the former or restore to him the thing so 
delivered. For example, when one of the two joint tenants pays the whole rent to the landlord, he is entitled to 
compensation from his co-tenant, or if A, a tradesmen, leaves goods at B’s house by mistake and B treats 
the goods as his own, he is bound to pay A for them.  
DISCHARGE OR TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS 
A contract is said to be discharged or terminated when the rights and obligations arising out of a contract are 
extinguished. 
Contracts may be discharged or terminated by any of the following modes: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a) Performance of Contracts (Section 37) 
Section 37 of the Act provides that the parties to a contract must either perform or offer to perform their 
respective promises, unless such performance is dispensed with or excused under the provision of the 
Indian Contract Act, or any other law. In case of death of the promisor before performance, the 
representatives of the promisor are bound to perform the promise unless a contrary intention appears from 
the contract. 
Illustration 
X promises to deliver a horse to Y on a certain day on payment of Rs 1,000. X dies before that day. X’s 
representatives are bound to deliver the horse to Y and Y is bound is pay Rs. 1,000 to X’s representatives. 
Tender of Performance (Section 38) 
In case of some contracts, it is sometimes sufficient if the promisor performs his side of the contract. Then, if 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
505 
the performance is rejected,the promisor is discharged from further liability and may sue for the breach of 
contract if he so wishes. This is called discharge by tender. 
To be valid, a tender must fulfil the following conditions 
 
(a) it must be unconditional; 
 
(b) if must be made at a proper time and place; 
 
(c) it must be made under circumstances enabling the other party to ascertain that the party by whom it 
is made is able and willing then and there to do the whole of what he is bound, to do by his promise; 
 
(d) if the tender relates to delivery of goods, the promisee must have a reasonable opportunity of 
seeing that the thing offered is the thing which the promisor is bound by his promise to deliver; 
 
(e) tender made to one of the several joint promisees has the same effect as a tender to all of them. 
Who can demand performance? 
Generally speaking, a stranger to contract cannot sue and the person who can demand performance is the 
party to whom the promise is made. But an assignee of the rights and benefits under a contract may demand 
performance by the promisor, in the same way as the assignor, (i.e., the promisee) could have demanded. 
Effect of refusal of party to perform wholly 
Section 39 provides that when a party to a contract has refused to perform or disabled himself from 
performing his promise in its entirety, the promisee may put an end to the contract unless he had signified by 
words or conduct his acquiescence in its continuance. 
Illustration 
 
(a) X, a singer enters into a contract with Y, the manager of a theatre to sing at his theatres two nights 
in every week during the next two months, and Y engaged to pay her Rs. 100 for each nights 
performance. On the sixth night X wilfully absents herself form the theatre. Y is at liberty to put an 
end to the contract. 
 
(b) If in the above illustration, with the assent of Y, X sings on the seventh night, Y is presumed to have 
signified his acquiescence in the continuance of the contract and cannot put an end to it; but is entitled 
to compensation for the damages sustained by him through X’s failure to sing on the sixth night. 
By whom contract must be performed 
Under Section 40 of the Act, if it appears from the nature of the case that it was the intention of the parties to 
a contract that it should be performed by the promisor himself such promise must be performed by the 
promisor himself. In other cases, the promisor or his representative may employ a competent person to 
perform it. 
Illustration 
 
(a) X promises to pay Rs. 1,000 to Y. X may either personally pay the money to Y or cause it to be paid 
to Y by another. If X dies before making payment, his representatives must perform the promise or 
employ some proper person to do so. 
 
(b) X promises to paint a picture for Y. X must personally perform the promise. 
Devolution of Joint Liabilities 
Under Section 42 of the Indian Contract Act, where two or more persons have made a joint promise then, 
EP-EBCL 
506 
unless a contrary intention appears from the contract all such persons should perform the promise. If any 
one of them dies, his representatives jointly with the survivor or survivors should perform. After the death of 
the last survivor, the representatives of all jointly must fulfil the promise. 
Under Section 43 of the Indian Contract Act when two or more persons made a joint promise, the promisee 
may, in the absence of an express agreement to the contrary compel any one or more of such joint 
promisors to perform the whole of the promise. Each of two or more joint promisors may compel every other 
joint promisor to contribute equally with himself to the performance of the promise unless a contrary intention 
appears from the contract. If any one of two ore more promisors make default in such contribution, the 
remaining joint promisors should bear the loss arising from such default in equal share. 
Illustrations 
 
(a) X, Y and Z jointly promise to pay `6,000 to A. A may compel either X or Y or Z to pay the amount. 
 
(b) In the above example imagine, Z is compelled to pay the whole amount; X is insolvent but his 
assets are sufficient to pay one-half of his debts. Z is entitled to receive `1,000 from X’s estate and 
`2,500 from Y. 
 
(c) X, Y and Z make a joint promise to pay `5,000 to A, Z is unable to pay any amount and X is 
compelled to pay the whole. X is entitled to receive `2,500 from Y. 
Under Section 44 of the Act, where two or more persons have made a joint promise, a release of one of such 
joint promisors by the promisee does not discharge the other joint promisor(s); neither does it free the joint 
promisor so released from responsibility to the other joint promisor or joint promisors. 
Devolution of Joint Rights 
A promise may be made to two or more persons. The promisees are called joint promisees. For example, X 
may give a promise to repay Rs. 1,000 given by Y and Z jointly. In such case, in the absence of a contrary 
intention, the right to claim, performance rests with Y and Z. If Y dies, Y’s representative jointly with Z may, 
demand performance. If Z also dies, the representatives of Y and Z may demand jointly performance from X. 
Assignment 
The promisee may assign rights and benefits of contract and the assignee will be entitled to demand 
performance by the promisor. But the assignment to be complete and effectual, must be made by an 
instrument in writing. 
An obligation or liability under a contract cannot be assigned. For example, if A owes B Rs. 500 and A 
transfers the liability to C i.e. asks C to pay the sum to B, this would not bind B, and B may not consent to 
this arrangement, as he may know nothing of C’s solvency. But if B consents to accept performance by C, 
there is a substitution of new contract and the old contract is discharged and all rights and liabilities under it 
are extinguished. This is technically called novation. 
(b) Discharge by Mutual Agreement or Consent (Sections 62 and 63) 
A contract may be discharged by the agreement of all parties to the contract, or by waiver or release by the 
party entitled to performance. 
The methods stipulated under Sections 62 and 63 of the Indian Contract Act for discharging a contract by 
mutual consent are: 
 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
507 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Novation  when a new contract is substituted for existing contract either between the same parties or 
between different parties, the consideration mutually being the discharge of the old contract. 
Alteration  change in one or more of the material terms of a contract. 
Rescission  by agreement between the parties at any time before it is discharged by performance or in 
some other way. 
Remission  acceptance of a lesser sum than what was contracted for or a lesser fulfilment of the promise 
made. 
Waiver  deliberate abandonment or giving up of a right which a party is entitled to under a contract, where 
upon the other party to the contract is released from his obligation. 
(c) Discharge by Lapes of Time 
The Limitation Act, in certain circumstance, affords a good defence to suits for breach of contract, and infact 
terminates the contract by depriving the party of his remedy to law. For example, where a debtor has failed to 
repay the loan on the stipulated date, the creditor must file the suit against him within three years of the 
default. If the limitation period of three years expires and he takes no action he will be barred from his 
remedy and the other party is discharged of his liability to perform. 
(d) Discharge by Operation of the Law 
Discharge under this head may take place as follows: 
 
(a) By merger: When the parties embody the inferior contract in a superior contract. 
 
(b) By the unauthorised alteration of items of a written document: Where a party to a written contract 
makes any material alteration without knowledge and consent of the other, the contract can be 
avoided by the other party. 
 
(c) By insolvency: The Insolvency Act provides for discharge of contracts under particular 
circumstances. For example, where the Court passes an order discharging the insolvent, this order 
exonerates or discharges him from liabilities on all debts incurred previous to his adjudication. 
(e) Discharge by Impossibility or Frustration (Section 56) 
A contract which is entered into to perform something that is clearly impossible is void. For instance, A 
agrees with B to discover treasure by magic. The agreement is void by virtue of Section 56 para 1 which lays 
down the principle that an agreement to do an act impossible in itself is void. 
EP-EBCL 
508 
Sometimes subsequent impossibility (i.e. where the impossibility supervenes after the contract has been 
made) renders the performance of a contract unlawful and stands discharged; as for example, where a 
singer contracts to sing and becomes too ill to do so, the contract becomes void. In this connection, para 2 of 
Section 56 provides that a contract to do an act, which after the contract is made, becomes impossible or by 
reason of some event which the promisor could not prevent, unlawful, becomes void when the act becomes 
impossible or unlawful. 
If the impossibility is not obvious and the promisor alone knows of the impossibility or illegally then existing or 
the promisor might have known as such after using reasonable diligence, such promisor is bound to 
compensate the promisee for any loss he may suffer through the non-performance of the promise inspite of 
the agreement being void ab-initio (Section 56, para 3). 
In Satyabarta Ghose v. MugnuramA.I.R. 1954 S.C. 44 the Supreme Court interpreted the term ‘impossible 
appearing in second paragraph of Section 56. The Court observed that the word ‘impossible has not been used 
here in the sense of physical or literal impossibility. The performance of an act may not be literally impossible 
but it may be impracticable and useless from the point of view of the object and purpose which the parties had 
in view; and if an untoward event or change of circumstances totally upsets the very foundation upon which the 
parties rested their bargain; it can very well be said that the promisor found it impossible to do the act which he 
promised to do. In this case, A undertook to sell a plot of land to B but before the plot could be developed, war 
broke out and the land was temporarily requisitioned by the Government. A offered to return earnest money to 
B in cancellation of contract. B did not accept and sued A for specific performance. A pleaded discharge by 
frustration. The Court held that Section 56 is not applicable on the ground that the requisition was of temporary 
nature and there was no time limit within which A was obliged to perform the contract. The impossibility was not 
of such a nature which would strike at the root of the contract. 
Discharge by Supervening Impossibility 
A contract will be discharged by subsequent or supervening impossibility in any of the following ways: 
 
(a) Where the subject-matter of the contract is destroyed without the fault of the parties, the contract is 
discharged. 
 
(b) When a contract is entered into on the basis of the continued existence of a certain state of affairs, 
the contract is discharged if the state of things changes or ceases to exist. 
 
(c) Where the personal qualifications of a party is the basis of the contract, the contract is discharged 
by the death or physical disablement of that party. 
Discharge by Supervening Illegality 
A contract which is contrary to law at the time of its formation is void. But if, after the making of the contract, 
owing to alteration of the law or the act of some person armed with statutory authority the performance of the 
contract becomes impossible, the contract is discharged. This is so because the performance of the promise 
is prevented or prohibited by a subsequent change in the law. A enters into contract with B for cutting trees. 
By a statutory provision cutting of trees is prohibited except under a licence and the same is refused to A. 
The contract is discharged. 
Cases in which there is no supervening impossibility 
In the following cases contracts are not discharged on the ground of supervening impossibility 
 
(a) Difficulty of performance: The mere fact that performance is more difficult or expensive than the 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
509 
parties anticipated does not discharge the duty to perform. 
 
(b) Commercial impossibilities do not discharge the contract. A contract is not discharged merely 
because expectation of higher profits is not realised. 
 
(c) Strikes, lockouts and civil disturbance like riots do not terminate contracts unless there is a clause in 
the contract providing for non-performance in such cases. 
Supervening impossibility or illegality is known as frustration under English Law. 
(f) Discharge by Breach 
Where the promisor neither performs his contract nor does he tender performance, or where the 
performance is defective, there is a breach of contract. The breach of contract may be (i) actual; or (ii) 
anticipatory. The actual breach may take place either at the time the performance is due, or when actually 
performing the contract. Anticipatory breach means a breach before the time for the performance has 
arrived. This may also take place in two ways – by the promisor doing an act which makes the performance 
of his promise impossible or by the promisor in some other way showing his intention not to perform it. 
Anticipatory Breach of Contract 
Breach of contract may occur, before the time for performance is due. This may happen where one of the 
parties definitely renounces the contract and shows his intention not to perform it or does some act which 
makes performance impossible. The other party, on such a breach being committed, has a right of action for 
damages. 
He may either sue for breach of contract immediately after repudiation or wait till the actual date when 
performance is due and then sue for breach. If the promisee adopts the latter course, i.e., waits till the date 
when performance is due, he keeps the contract alive for the benefit of the promisor as well as for his own. 
He remains liable under it and enables the promisor not only to complete the contract in spite of previous 
repudiation, but also to avail himself of any excuse for non- performance which may have come into 
existence before the time fixed for performance. 
In Hochester v. De La Tour (1853) E.R. 922, A hired B in April to act as a courier commencing employment 
from 1st June, but wrote to B in May repudiating the agreement, B sued A for breach of contract immediately 
after repudiation. A contended that there could not be breach of contract before June 1. Held, B was 
immediately entitled to sue and need not wait till 1st June, for his right of action to accrue. 
In Avery v. Bowden (1856) 116 E.R. 1122, A hired B’s ship to carry a cargo from Russia. Later on B 
repudiated the contract. A delayed taking action hoping B would change his mind before the performance 
date. War broke out between Russia and Britain before the performance date frustating the contract. Held, A 
lost his right to sue B for damages by his delay. 
In Frost v. Knight (1872) L.R. 7 Ex. 111, the law on the subject of anticipatory breach was summed up as 
follows: 
“The promisee if he pleases may treat the notice of intention as inoperative and await the time when the 
contract is to be executed and then hold the other party responsible for all the consequences of non-
performance: but in that case he keeps the contract alive for the benefit of the other party as well as his own; 
he remains subject to all his own obligations and liabilities under it, and enables the other party not only to 
complete the contract, if so advised, notwithstanding his previous repudiation of it, but also to take advantage 
of any supervening circumstances which would justify him in declining to complete it.”

REMEDIES FOR BREACH 
Where a contract is broken, the injured party has several courses of action open to him. The appropriate 
remedy in any case will depend upon the subject-matter of the contract and the nature of the breach. 
(i) Remedies for Breach of Contract 
In case of breach of contract, the injured party may: 
 
(a) Rescind the contract and refuse further performance of the contract; 
 
(b) Sue for damages; 
 
(c) Sue for specific performance; 
 
(d) Sue for an injunction to restrain the breach of a negative term; and 
 
(e) Sue on quantum meruit 
When a party to a contract has broken the contract, the other party may treat the contract as rescinded and 
he is absolved from all his obligations under the contract. Under Section 65, when a party treats the contract 
as rescinded, he makes himself liable to restore any benefits he has received under the contract to the party 
from whom such benefits were received. Under Section 75 of the Indian Contract Act, if a person rightfully 
rescinds a contract, he is entitled to a compensation for any damage which he has sustained through the 
non-fulfilment of the contract by the other party. Section 64 deals with consequences of rescission of 
voidable contracts, i.e., where there is flaw in the consent of one party to the contract. Under this Section 
when a person at whose option a contract is voidable rescinds, the other party thereto need not perform any 
promise therein contained in which he is the promisor. The party rescinding a voidable contract shall, if he 
has received any benefit thereunder, from another party to such contract, restore such benefit so far as may 
be, to the person from whom it was received. 
(ii) Damages for Breach of Contract 
Under Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, when a contract has been broken, a party who suffers by such 
breach is entitled to receive, from the party who has broken the contract, compensation for any loss or 
damage, caused to him thereby, which naturally arose in the usual course of things from such breach or 
which the parties knew, when they made the contract to be likely to result from the breach of it. Such 
compensation is not to be given for any remote and indirect loss or damage sustained by reason of the 
breach. 
The foundation of the claim for damages rests in the celebrated case of Hadley v. Baxendale, (1854) 9 Ex. 
341. The facts of this case were as follows: 
There was a breakdown of a shaft in A’s mill. He delivered the shaft to B, a common carrier to be taken to a 
manufacturer to copy and make a new one. A did not make known to B that delay would result in loss of 
profits. By some neglect on the part of B, the delivery of the shaft was delayed in transit beyond a reasonable 
time. As a result, the mill was idle for a longer period than it would otherwise have been, had there been no 
such delay. It was held, B was not liable for the loss of profits during the period of delay as the circumstances 
communicated to A did not show that the delay in the delivery of the shaft would entail loss of profits to the 
mill. In the course of the judgement it was observed: 
“Where two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages which the other party 
ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly and reasonably be 
considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of things from such breach of contract 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
511 
itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time 
they made the contract as the probable result of the breach of it. Now, if the special circumstances under 
which the contract was actually made were communicated by the plaintiffs to the defendants and thus known 
to both the parties, the damages resulting from the breach of such a contract which they would reasonably 
contemplate, would be the amount of injury which would ordinarily follow from a breach of contract under 
these special circumstances so known and communicated. But, on other hand, if these special 
circumstances were wholly unknown to the party breaking the contract, he at the most could only be 
supposed to have had in his contemplation, the amount of injury which would arise generally and in the great 
multitude of cases not affected by any special circumstances from such breach of contract. For, had the 
special circumstances been known, the parties might have specially provided for the breach of contract by 
special terms as to damages in that case and of this advantage it would be very unjust to deprive them.” 
Liquidated and Unliquidated damages: Where the contracting parties agree in advance the amount payable 
in the event of breach, the sum payable is called liquidated damages. 
Where the amount of compensation claimed for a breach of contract is left to be assessed by the Court, 
damages claimed are called unliquidated damages. 
Unliquidated Damages 
Those are of the following kinds: 
(a) general or ordinary damages, (b) special damages (c) exemplary or punitive damages, and (d) nominal 
damages. 
Ordinary Damages 
These are restricted to pecuniary compensation to put the injured party in the position he would have been 
had the contract been performed. It is the estimated amount of loss actually incurred. Thus, it applies only to 
the proximate consequences of the breach of the contract and the remote consequences are not generally 
regarded. For example, in a contract for the sale of goods, the damages payable would be the difference 
between the contract price and the price at which the goods are available on the date of the breach. 
Special Damages 
Special damages are those resulting from a breach of contract under some peculiar circumstances. If at the 
time of entering into the contract, the party has notice of special circumstances which makes special loss the 
likely result of the breach in the ordinary course of things, then upon his-breaking the contract and the 
special loss following this breach, he will be required to make good the special loss. For example, A 
delivered goods to the Railway Administration to be carried to a place where an exhibition was being held 
and told the goods clerk that if the goods did not reach the destination on the stipulated date he would suffer 
a special loss. The goods reached late. He was entitled to claim special damages. 
Exemplary Damages 
These damages are awarded to punish the defendant and are not, as a rule, granted in case of breach of 
contract. In two cases, however, the court may award such damages, viz., 
 
(i) breach of promise to marry; and 
 
(ii) wrongful dishonour of a customerscheque by the banker. 
In a breach of promise to marry, the amount of the damages will depend upon the extent of injury to the 
partys feelings. In the bankers case, the smaller the amount of the chequedishonoured, larger will be 
EP-EBCL 
512 
damages as the credit of the customer would be injured in a far greater measure, if a cheque for a small 
amount is wrongfully dishonoured. 
Nominal Damages 
Nominal damages consist of a small token award, e.g., a rupee of even 25 paise, where there has been an 
infringement of contractual rights, but no actual loss has been suffered. These damages are awarded to 
establish the right to decree for breach of contract. 
Liquidated Damages and Penalty 
Where the contracting parties fix at the time of contract the amount of damages that would be payable in case 
of breach, in English law, the question may arise whether the term amounts to “liquidated damages” or a 
“penalty”? The Courts in England usually give effect to liquidated damages, but they always relieve against 
penalty. 
The test of the two is that where the amount fixed is a genuine pre-estimate of the loss in case of breach, it is 
liquidated damages and will be allowed. If the amount fixed is without any regard to probable loss, but is 
intended to frighten the party and to prevent him from committing breach, it is a penalty and will not be 
allowed. 
In Indian law, there is no such difference between liquidated damages and penalty. Section 74 provides for 
“reasonable compensation” upto the stipulated amount whether it is by way of liquidated damages or penalty. 
For example, A borrows Rs. 500 from B and promises to pay Rs. 1,000 if he fails to repay Rs. 500 on the 
stipulated date. On A’s failure to repay on the given date, B is entitled to recover from A such compensation, 
not exceeding Rs. 1,000 as the Court may consider reasonable. (Union of India v. Raman Iron Foundry, AIR 
1974 SC 1265). 
(iii) Specific Performance 
It means the actual carrying out by the parties of their contract, and in proper cases the Court will insist upon 
the parties carrying out this agreement. Where a party fails to perform the contract, the Court may, at its 
discretion, order the defendant to carry out his undertaking according to the terms of the contract. A decree 
for specific performance may be granted in addition to or instead of damages. 
Specific performance is usually granted in contracts connected with land, e.g., purchase of a particular plot 
or house, or to take debentures in a company. In case of sale of goods, it will only be granted if the goods 
are unique and cannot be purchased in the market, e.g., a particular race horse, or one of special value to 
the party suing by reason of personal or family association, e.g., an heirloom. 
Specific performance will not be ordered: 
 
(a) where monetary compensation is an adequate remedy; 
 
(b) where the Court cannot supervise the execution of the contract, e.g., a building contract; 
 
(c) where the contract is for personal service; and 
 
(d) where one of the parties is a minor. 
(iv) Injunction 
An injunction, is an order of a Court restraining a person from doing a particular act. It is a mode of securing 
the specific performance of a negative term of the contract, (i.e., where he is doing something which he 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
513 
promises not to do), the Court may in its discretion issue an order to the defendant restraining him from 
doing what he promised not to do. Injunction may be prohibitory or mandatory. In prohibitory, the Court 
restrains the commission of a wrongful act whereas in mandatory, it restrains continuance of a wrongful 
commission. 
In Lumley v. Wagner (1852) 90 R.R. 125. W agreed to sing at L’s theatre and nowhere else. W, in breach of 
contract with L entered into a contract to sing for Z. Held, although W could not be compelled to sing at L’s 
theatre, yet she could be restrained by injunction from singing for Z. 
CONTRACT OF INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE (Sections 124 to 147) 
 
Meaning of Indemnity 
A contract of indemnity is a contract by which one party promises to save the other party from loss caused to 
him by the conduct of the promisor himself, or by the conduct of any other person (Section 124). For 
example, A contracts to indemnify B against the consequence of any proceedings which C may take against 
B in respect of a certain sum of 300 rupees. This is a contract of indemnity. The contract of indemnity may be 
express or implied. The later may be inferred from the circumstances of a particular case, e.g., an act done 
by A at the request of B. If A incurs any expenses, he can recover the same from B. 
The person who promises to indemnify or make good the loss is called the indemnifier and the person whose 
loss is made good is called the indemnified or the indemnity holder. A contract of insurance is an example of 
a contract of indemnity according to English Law. In consideration of premium, the insurer promises to make 
good the loss suffered by the assured on account of the destruction by fire of his property insured against 
fire. 
Under the Indian Contract Act, the contract of indemnity is restricted to such cases only where the loss 
promised to be reimbursed, is caused by the conduct of the promisor or of any other person. The loss 
caused by events or accidents which do not depend on the conduct of any person, it seems, cannot be 
sought to be reimbursed under a contract of indemnity. 
Rights of Indemnity Holder when Sued 
Under Section 125, the promisee in a contract of indemnity, acting within the scope of his authority, is 
entitled to recover from the promisor— 
 
(1) all damages which he may be compelled to pay in any suit in respect of any matter to which the 
promise to indemnify applies; 
 
(2) all costs which he may be compelled to pay in any such suit if, in bringing or defending it, he did not 
contravene the orders of the promisor, and acted as if it would have been prudent for him to act in 
the absence of any contract of indemnity, or if the promisor authorised him to bring or defend the 
suit; and 
 
(3) all sums which he may have paid under the terms of any compromise of any such suit, if the 
compromise was not contrary to the orders of the promisor, and was one which it would have been 
prudent for the promisee to make in the absence of any contract of indemnity, or if the promisor 
authorised him to compromise the suit. 
Meaning of Contract of Guarantee 
A contract of guarantee is a contract to perform the promise, or discharge the liability of a third person in 
EP-EBCL 
514 
case of his default. The person who gives the guarantee is called the Surety, the person for whom the 
guarantee is given is called the Principal Debtor, and the person to whom the guarantee is given is called the 
Creditor (Section 126). A guarantee may be either oral or written, although in the English law, it must be in 
writing.  
Illustration 
A advances a loan of Rs. 5,000 to B and C promises to A that if B does not repay the loan, C will do so. This 
is a contract of guarantee. Here B is the principal debtor, A is the creditor and C is the surety or guarantor. 
Like a contract of indemnity, a guarantee must also satisfy all the essential elements of a valid contract. 
There is, however, a special feature with regard to consideration in a contract of guarantee. The 
consideration received by the principal debtor is sufficient for surety. Section 127 provides that anything done 
or any promise made for the benefit of the principal debtor may be a sufficient consideration to the surety for 
giving the guarantee. 
Illustration 
 
(i) B requests A to sell and deliver to him goods on credit. A agrees to do so, provided C will guarantee 
the payment of the price of the goods. C promises to guarantee the payment in consideration of A’s 
promise to deliver the goods. This is sufficient consideration for C’s promise. 
 
(ii) A sells and delivers goods to B.  C afterwards requests A to forbear to sue B for the debt for a year, 
and promises that if he does so, C will pay for them in default of payment by B.  A agrees to forbear 
as requested. This is sufficient consideration for C’s promise. 
Distinction between Indemnity and Guarantee 
A contract of indemnity differs from a contract of guarantee in the following ways: 
 
(a) In a contract of indemnity there are only two parties: the indemnifier and the indemnified. In a 
contract of guarantee, there are three parties; the surety, the principal debtor and the creditor. 
 
(b) In a contract of indemnity, the liability of the indemnifier is primary. In a contract of guarantee, the 
liability of the surety is secondary. The surety is liable only if the principal debtor makes a default, 
the primary liability being that of the principal debtor. 
 
(c) The indemnifier need not necessarily act at the request of the debtor; the surety gives guarantee 
only at the request of the principal debtor. 
 
(d) In the case of a guarantee, there is an existing debt or duty, the performance of which is guaranteed 
by the surety, whereas in the case of indemnity, the possibility of any loss happening is the only 
contingency against which the indemnifier undertakes to indemnify. 
 
(e) The surety, on payment of the debt when the principal debtor has failed to pay is entitled to proceed 
against the principal debtor in his own right, but the indemnifier cannot sue third-parties in his own 
name, unless there be assignment. He must sue in the name of the indemnified. 
Extent of Surety’s Liability 
The liability of the surety is co-extensive with that of the principal debtor unless the contract otherwise 
provides (Section 128). A creditor is not bound to proceed against the principal debtor. He can sue the surety 
without sueing the principal debtor. As soon as the debtor has made default in payment of the debt, the 
surety is immediately liable. But until default, the creditor cannot call upon the surety to pay. In this sense, 
the nature of the surety’s liability is secondary. 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
515 
Illustration 
A guarantees to B the payment of a bill of exchange by C, the acceptor. The bill is dishonoured by C. A is liable 
not only for the amount of the bill but also for any interest and charges which may have become due on it. 
Section 128 only explains the quantum of a surety’s obligation when terms of the contract do not limit it. 
Conversely it doesn’t follow that the surety can never be liable when the principal debtor cannot be held 
liable. Thus, a surety is not discharged from liability by the mere fact that the contract between the principal 
debtor and creditor was voidable at the option of the former, and was avoided by the former. Where the 
agreement between the principal debtor and creditor is void as for example in the case of minority of 
principal debtor, the surety is liable as a principal debtor; for in such cases the contract of the so-called 
surety is not collateral, but a principal contract (Kashiba  v.Shripat (1894) 19 Bom. 697). 
Kinds of Guarantees 
A contract of guarantee may be for an existing debt, or for a future debt. It may be a specific guarantee, or it 
may be a continuing guarantee. A specific guarantee is given for a single debt and comes to an end when 
the debt guaranteed has been paid. 
A continuing guarantee is one which extends to a series of transactions (Section 129). The liability of surety 
in case of a continuing guarantee extends to all the transactions contemplated until the revocation of the 
guarantee. As for instance, S, in consideration that C will employ P in collecting the rents of C’s Zamindari, 
promises C to be responsible to the amount of Rs. 5,000 for the due collection and payment by P of these 
rents. This is a continuing guarantee. 
Revocation of Continuing Guarantee 
A continuing guarantee is revoked in the following circumstances: 
 
(a) By notice of revocation by the surety (Section 130): The notice operates to revoke the surety’s 
liability as regards future transactions. He continues to be liable for transactions entered into prior to 
the notice (Offord  v. Davies (1862) 6 L.T.S. 79). 
 
(b) By the death of the surety: The death of the surety operates, in the absence of contract (Lloyds v. 
Harper (188) 16 Ch. D. 290) as a revocation of a continuing guarantee, so far as regards future 
transactions (Section 131). But for all the transactions made before his death, the surety’s estate will 
be liable. 
Rights of Surety 
A surety has certain rights against the creditor, (Section 141) the principal debtor (Sections 140 and 145) and 
the co-securities (Sections 146 and 147). Those are— 
 
(a) Surety’s rights against the creditor: Under Section 141 a surety is entitled to the benefit of every 
security which the creditor has against the principal debtor at the time when the contract of 
suretyship is entered into whether the surety knows of the existence of such security or not; and, if 
the creditor losses or, without the consent of the surety parts with such security, the surety is 
discharged to the extent of the value of the security. 
 
(b) Rights against the principal debtor: After discharging the debt, the surety steps into the shoes of the 
creditor or is subrogated to all the rights of the creditor against the principal debtor. He can then sue 
the principal debtor for the amount paid by him to the creditor on the debtors default; he becomes a 
creditor of the principal debtor for what he has paid. 
EP-EBCL 
516 
 
 In some circumstances, the surety may get certain rights even before payment. The surety has 
remedies against the principal debtor before payment and after payment. In Mamta Ghose  v. 
United Industrial Bank (AIR 1987 Cal. 180) where the principal debtor, after finding that the debt 
became due, started disposing of his properties to prevent seizure by surety, the Court granted an 
injunction to the surety restraining the principal debtor from doing so. The surety can compel the 
debtor, after debt has become due to exonerate him from his liability by paying the debt. 
 
(c) Surety’s rights gains co-sureties: When a surety has paid more than his share of debt to the creditor, 
he has a right of contribution from the co-securities who are equally bound to pay with him. A, B and C 
are sureties to D for the sum of Rs. 3,000 lent to E who makes default in payment. A, B and C are 
liable, as between themselves to pay Rs. 1,000 each. If any one of them has to pay more than Rs. 
1,000 he can claim contribution from the other two to reduce his payment to only Rs. 1,000. If one of 
them becomes insolvent, the other two shall have to contribute the unpaid amount equally.  
Discharge of Surety 
A surety may be discharged from liability under the following circumstances: 
 
(a) By notice of revocation in case of a continuing guarantee as regards future transaction (Section 
130.) 
 
(b) By the death of the surety as regards future transactions, in a continuing guarantee in the absence 
of a contract to the contrary (Section 131). 
 
(c) Any variation in the terms of the contract between the creditor and the principal debtor, without the 
consent of the surety, discharges the surety as regards all transactions taking place after the 
variation (Section 133). 
 
(d) A surety will be discharged if the creditor releases the principal debtor, or acts or makes an 
omission which results in the discharge of the principal debtor (Section 134). But where the creditor 
fails to sue the principal debtor within the limitation period, the surety is not discharged. 
 
(e) Where the creditor, without the consent of the surety, makes an arrangement with the principal 
debtor for composition, or promises to give time or not to sue him, the surety will be discharged 
(Section 135). 
 
(f) If the creditor does any act which is against the rights of the surety, or omits to do an act which his 
duty to the surety requires him to do, and the eventual remedy of the surety himself against the 
principal debtor is thereby impaired, the surety is discharged (Section 139). 
 
(g) If the creditor loses or parts with any security which at the time of the contract the debtor had given 
in favour of the creditor, the surety is discharged to the extent of the value of the security, unless the 
surety consented to the release of such security by creditor in favour of the debtor. It is immaterial 
whether the surety was or is aware of such security or not (Section 141). 
CONTRACT OF BAILMENT AND PLEDGE 
 
(a) Bailment 
A bailment is a transaction whereby one person delivers goods to another person for some purpose, upon a 
contract that they are, when the purpose is accomplished to be returned or otherwise disposed of according 
to the directions of the person delivering them (Section 148). The person who delivers the goods is called the 
bailor and the person to whom they are delivered is called the bailee. 
Bailment is a voluntary delivery of goods for a temporary purpose on the understanding that they are to be 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
517 
returned in specie in the same or altered form. The ownership of the goods remains with the bailor, the bailee 
getting only the possession. Delivery of goods may be actual or constructive, e.g., where the key of a godown is 
handed over to another person, it amounts to delivery of goods in the godown. 
Gratuitous Bailment 
A gratuitous bailment is one in which neither the bailor nor the bailee is entitled to any remuneration. Such a 
bailment may be for the exclusive benefit of the bailor, e.g., when A leaves his dog with a neighbour to be 
looked after in A’s absence on a holiday. It may again be for exclusive benefit of the bailee, e.g., where you 
lend your book to a friend of yours for a week. In neither case any charge is made. 
A gratuitous bailment terminates by the death of either the bailor or the bailee (Section 162). 
Under Section 159 the lender of a thing for use may at any time require its return if the loan was gratuitous, 
even though he lent it for a specified time or purpose. But if on the faith of such loan made for a specified 
time or purpose, the borrower has acted in such a manner that the return of the thing lent before the time 
agreed upon would cause him loss exceeding the benefit actually derived by him from the loan, the lender 
must, if he compels the return, indemnify the borrower the amount in which the loss so occasioned exceeds 
the benefit so derived. 
Bailment for Reward 
This is for the mutual benefit of both the bailor and the bailee. For example, A lets out a motor-car for hire to 
B. A is the bailor and receives the hire charges and B is the bailee and gets the use of the car. Where, A 
hands over his goods to B, a carrier for carriage at a price, A is the bailor who enjoys the benefit of carriage 
and B is the bailee who receives a remuneration for carrying the goods. 
Duties of Bailee 
The bailee owes the following duties in respect of the goods bailed to him: 
 
(a) The bailee must take as much care of the goods bailed to him as a man of ordinary prudence would 
take under similar circumstances of his own goods of the same bulk, quality and value as the goods 
bailed (Section 151). If he takes this much care he will not be liable for any loss, destruction or 
deterioration of the goods bailed (Section 152). The degree of care required from the bailee is the 
same whether the bailment is for reward or gratuitous. 
 
 Of course, the bailee may agree to take special care of the goods, e.g., he may agree to keep the 
property safe from all perils and answers for accidents or thefts. But even such a bailee will not be 
liable for loss happening by an act of God or by public enemies. 
 
(b) The bailee is under a duty not to use the goods in an unauthorised manner or for unauthorised 
purpose (Section 153). If he does so, the bailor can terminate the bailment and claim damages for 
any loss or damage caused by the unauthorised used (Section 154). 
 
(c) He must keep the goods bailed to him separate from his own goods (Sections 155-157). 
 
 If the bailee without the consent of the bailor, mixes the goods of the bailor with his own goods, the 
bailor and the bailee shall have an interest, in production to their respective shares, in the mixture 
thus produced. If the bailee without the consent of the bailor, mixes the goods of the bailor with his 
own goods, and the goods can be separated or divided, the property in the goods remains in the 
parties respectively; but the bailee is bound to bear the expenses of separation, and any damages 
arising from the mixture. 
EP-EBCL 
518 
 
 If the bailee without the consent of the bailor mixes, the goods of the bailor with his own goods, in 
such a manner that it is impossible to separate the goods bailed from the other goods and deliver 
them back, the bailor is entitled to be compensated by the bailee for the loss of goods. 
 
(d) He must not set up an adverse title to the goods. 
 
(e) It is the duty of the bailee to return the goods without demand on the expiry of the time fixed or 
when the purpose is accomplished (Section 160). If he fails to return them, he shall be liable for any 
loss, destruction or deterioration of the goods even without negligence on his part (Section 161). 
 
(f) In the absence of any contract to the contrary, the baliee must return to the bailor any increase, or 
profits which may have accrued from the goods bailed; for example, when A leaves a cow in the 
custody of B to be taken care of and the cow gets a calf, B is bound is deliver the cow as well as the 
calf to A (Section 163). 
Bailees Particular Lien (Section 170) 
Where the goods are bailed for a particular purpose and the bailee in due performance of bailment, expands 
his skill and labour, he has in the absence of an agreement to the contrary a lien on the goods, i.e., the bailee 
can retain the goods until his charges in respect of labour and skill used on the goods are paid by the bailor. A 
gives a piece of cloth to B, a tailor, for making it into a suit, B promises to have the suit ready for delivery within 
a fortnight, B has the suit ready for delivery. He has a right to retain the suit until he is paid his dues. The 
section expresses the Common Law principle that if a man has an article delivered to him on the improvement 
of which he has to bestow trouble and expenses, he has a right to detain it until his demand is paid. 
The right of lien arises only where labour and skill have been used so as to confer an additional value on the 
article. 
Particular and General Lien 
Lien is of two kinds: Particular lien and General lien. A particular lien is one which is available only against 
that property of which the skill and labour have been exercised. A bailee’s lien is a particular lien. 
A general lien is a right to detain any property belonging to the other and in the possession of the person 
trying to exercise the lien in respect of any payment lawfully due to him. 
Thus, a general lien is the right to retain the property of another for a general balance of accounts but a 
particular lien is a right to retain only for a charge on account of labour employed or expenses bestowed 
upon the identical property detained. 
The right of general lien is expressly given by Section 171 of the Indian Contract Act to bankers, factors, 
warfingers, attorneys of High Court and policy-brokers, provided there is no agreement to the contrary. 
Duties of bailor 
The bailor has the following duties: 
 
(a) The bailor must disclose all the known faults in the goods; and if he fails to do that, he will be liable 
for any damage resulting directly from the faults (Section 150). For example, A delivers to B, a 
carrier, some explosive in a case, but does not warn B. The case is handled without extraordinary 
care necessary for such articles and explodes. A is liable for all the resulting damage to men and 
other goods. 
 
 In the case of bailment for hire, a still greater responsibility is placed on the bailor. He will be liable 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
519 
even if he did not know of the defects (Section 150). A hires a carriage of B. The carriage is unsafe 
though B does not know this. A is injured. B is responsible to A for the injury. 
 
(b) It is the duty of the bailor to pay any extraordinary expenses incurred by the bailee. For example, if 
a horse is lent for a journey, the expense of feeding the house would, of course, subject to any 
special agreement be borne by the bailee. If however the horse becomes ill and expenses have 
been incurred on its treatment, the bailor shall have to pay these expenses (Section 158). 
 
(c) The bailor is bound to indemnify the bailee for any cost or costs which the bailee may incur because 
of the defective title of the bailor of the goods bailed (Section 164). 
Termination of bailment 
Where the bailee wrongfully uses or dispose of the goods bailed, the bailor may determine the bailment 
(Section 153.) 
As soon as the period of bailment expires or the object of the bailment has been achieved, the bailment 
comes to an end, and the bailee must return the goods to the bailor (Section 160). Bailment is terminated 
when the subject matter of bailment is destroyed or by reason of change in its nature, becomes incapable of 
use for the purpose of bailment. 
A gratuitous bailment can be terminated by the bailor at any time, even before the agreed time, subject to the 
limitation that where termination before the agreed period causes loss in excess of benefit, the bailor must 
compensate the bailee (Section 159). 
A gratuitous bailment terminates by the death of either the bailor or the bailee (Section 162). 
Finder of Lost Goods 
The position of a finder of lost goods is exactly that of a bailee. The rights of a finder are that he can sue the 
owner for any reward that might have been offered, and may retain the goods until he receives the reward. 
But where the owner has offered no reward, the finder has only a particular lien and can detain the goods 
until he receives compensation for the troubles and expenses incurred in preserving the property for finding 
out the true owner. But he cannot file a suit for the recovery of the compensation [Section 168]. 
Thus, as against the true owner, the finder of goods in a public or quasi public place is only a bailee; he keeps 
the article in trust for the real owner. As against every-one else, the property in the goods vests in the finder on 
his taking possession of it. 
The finder has a right to sell the property— 
 
(a) where the owner cannot with reasonable diligence be found, or 
 
(b) when found, he refuses to pay the lawful charges of the finder and— 
 
(i) if the thing is in danger of perishing or losing greater part of its value, or 
 
(ii) when the lawful charges of the finder for the preservation of goods and the finding out of the 
owner amounts to two-thirds of the value of the thing (Section 169). 
Carrier as Bailee 
A common carrier undertakes to carry goods of all persons who are willing to pay his usual or reasonable 
rates. He further undertakes to carry them safely, and make good all loses, unless they are caused by act of 
EP-EBCL 
520 
God or public enemies. Carriers by land including railways and carriers by inland navigation, are common 
carriers. Carriers by Sea for hire are not common carriers and they can limit their liability. Railways in India 
are now common carriers. 
Inn-keepers: The liability of a hotel keeper is governed by Sections 151 and 152 of the Contract Act and is 
that of an ordinary bailee with regard to the property of the guests. 
C stayed in a room in a hotel. The hotel-keeper knew that the room was in an insecure condition. While C 
was dining in the dining room, some articles were stolen from his room. It was held that the hotel-keeper was 
liable as he should have taken reasonable steps to rectify the insecured condition of the rooms (Jan & San v. 
Caneron (1922) 44 All. 735). 
(b) Pledge 
Pledge or pawn is a contract whereby an article is deposited with a lender of money or promisee as security 
for the repayment of a loan or performance of a promise. The bailor or depositor is called the Pawnor and the 
bailee or depositee the “Pawnee” (Section 172). Since pledge is a branch of bailment, the pawness is bound 
to take reasonable care of the goods pledged with him. Any kind of goods, valuables, documents or 
securities may be pledged. The Government securities, e.g., promissory notes must, however, be pledged by 
endorsement and delivery. 
The following are the essential ingredients of a pledge: 
 
(i) The property pledged should be delivered to the pawnee. 
 
(ii) Delivery should be in pursuance of a contract. 
 
(iii) Delivery should be for the purpose of security. 
 
(iv) Delivery should be upon a condition to return. 
Rights of the Pawnee 
No property in goods pawned passes to the pawnee, but the pawnee gets a “special property to retain 
possession even against the true owner until the payment of the debt, interest on the debt, and any other 
expense incurred in respect of the possession or for preservation of the goods pledged” (Section 173). The 
pawnee must return the goods to the pawnor on the tender of all that is due to him. The pawnee cannot 
confer a good title upon a bona fide purchaser for value. 
Should the pawnor make a default in payment of the debt or performance of the promise at the stipulated 
time, the pawnee may- 
 
(i) file a suit for the recovery of the amount due to him while retaining the goods pledged as collateral 
security; or 
 
(ii) sue for the sale of the goods and the realisation of money due to him; or 
 
(iii) himself sell the goods pawned, after giving reasonable notice to the pawnor, sue for the deficiency, 
if any, after the sale. 
If the sale is made in execution of a decree, the pawnee may buy the goods at the sale. But he cannot sell 
them to himself in a sale made by himself under (iii) above. If after sale of the goods, there is surplus, the 
pawnee must pay it to the pawnor (Section 176). 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
521 
Rights of Pawnor 
On default by pawnor to repay on the stipulated date, the pawnee may sell the goods after giving reasonable 
notice to the pawnor. If the pawnee makes an unauthorised sale without giving notice to the pawnor, the pawnor 
has the following rights— 
 
(i) He can file a suit for redemption of goods by depositing the money treating the sale as if it had 
never taken place; or 
 
(ii) He can ask for damages on the ground of conversion. 
Pledge by Non-owners 
Ordinarily, the owner of the goods would pledge them to secure a loan but the law permits under certain 
circumstances a pledge by a person who is not the owner but is in possession of the goods. Thus, a valid 
pledge may be created by the following non-owners. 
 
(a) A mercantile agent: Where a mercantile agent is, with the consent of the owner, in possession of 
goods or the documents of title to goods, any pledge made by him, when acting in the ordinary 
course of business of a mercantile agent, is as valid as if he were expressly authorised by the 
owner of the goods to make the same. But the pledge is valid only if the pawnee acts in good faith 
and has not at the time of the pledge notice that the pawnor has not the authority to pledge (Section 
178). 
 
(b) Pledge by seller or buyer in possession after sale: A seller, left in possession of goods sold, is no 
more the owner, but pledge by him will be valid, provided the pawnee acted in good faith and had 
no notice of the sale of goods to the buyer (Section 30 of The Sale of Goods Act 1930). 
 
(c) Pledge where pawnor having limited interest: When the pawnor is not the owner of the goods but 
has a limited interest in the goods which he pawns, e.g., he is a mortgagee or he has a lien with 
respect of these goods, the pledge will be valid to the extent of such interest. 
 
(d) Pledge by co-owner in possession: One of the several co-owners of goods in possession thereof 
with the assent of the other co-owners may create a valid pledge of the goods. 
 
(e) Pledge by person in possession under a voidable contract: A person may obtain possession under 
a contract which is voidable at the option of the lawful owner on the ground of misrepresentation, 
fraud, etc. The person in possession may pledge the goods before the contract is avoided by the 
other party (Section 178A). 
LAW OF AGENCY 
Definition of Agent (Section 182) 
An agent is a person who is employed to bring his principal into contractual relations with third-parties. As the 
definition indicates, an agent is a mere connecting link between the principal and a third-party. But during the 
period that an agent is acting for his principal, he is clothed with the capacity of his principal. 
Creation of Agency 
A contract of agency may be express or implied, (Section 186) but consideration is not an essential element 
in this contract (Section 185). Agency may also arise by estoppel, necessity or ratification. 
 
(a) Express Agency: A contract of agency may be made orally or in writing. The usual form of written 
contract of agency is the Power of Attorney, which gives him the authority to act on behalf of his 
EP-EBCL 
522 
principal in accordance with the terms and conditions therein. In an agency created to transfer 
immovable property, the power of attorney must be registered. A power of attorney may be general, 
giving several powers to the agent, or special, giving authority to the agent for transacting a single 
act. 
 
(b) Implied Agency: Implied agency may arise by conduct, situation of parties or necessity of the case. 
 
(i) Agency by Estoppel (Section 237): Estoppel arises when you are precluded from denying the 
truth of anything which you have represented as a fact, although it is not a fact. Thus, where P 
allows third-parties to believe that A is acting as his authorised agent, he will be estopped from 
denying the agency if such third-parties relying on it make a contract with A even when A had 
no authority at all. 
 
(ii) Wife as agent: Where a husband and wife are living together, the wife is presumed to have her 
husbands authority to pledge his credit for the purchase of necessaries of life suitable to their 
standard of living. But the husband will not be liable if he shows that (i) he had expressly 
warned the trademan not to supply goods on credit to his wife; or (ii) he had expressly forbidden 
the wife to pledge his credit; or (iii) his wife was already sufficiently supplied with the articles in 
question; or (iv) she was supplied with a sufficient allowance. 
 
 Similarly, where any person is held out by another as his agent, the third-party can hold that 
person liable for the acts of the ostensible agent, or the agent by holding out. Partners are each 
others agents for making contracts in the ordinary course of the partnership business. 
 
(iii) Agency of Necessity (Sections 188 and 189): In certain circumstances, a person who has been 
entrusted with anothers property, may have to incur unauthorised expenses to protect or preserve it. 
Such an agency is called an agency of necessity. For example, A sent a horse by railway and on its 
arrival at the destination there was no one to receive it. The railway company, being bound to take 
reasonable steps to keep the horse alive, was an agent of necessity of A. 
 
 A wife deserted by her husband and thus forced to live separate from him, can pledge her husbands 
credit to buy all necessaries of life according to the position of the husband even against his wishes. 
 
(iv) Agency by ratification (Sections 169-200): Where a person having no authority purports to act as 
agent, or a duly appointed agent exceeds his authority, the principal is not bound by the contract 
supposedly based on his behalf. But the principal may ratify the agents transaction and so accept 
liability. In this way an agency by ratification arises. This is also known as ex post facto agency—
agency arising after the event. The effect of ratification is to render the contract binding on the 
principal as if the agent had been authorisedbefore hand. Also ratification relates back to the 
original making of the contract so that the agency is taken to have come into existence from the 
moment the agent first acted, and not from the date the principal ratified it. Ratification is effective 
only if the following conditions are satisfied 
 
(a) The agent must expressly contract as agent for a principal who is in existence and competent to 
contract. 
 
(b) The principal must be competent to contract not only at the time the agent acted, but also when 
he ratified the agents act. 
 
(c) The principal at the time of ratification has full knowledge of the material facts, and must ratify 
the whole contract, within a reasonable time. 
 
(d) Ratification cannot be made so as to subject a third-party to damages, or terminate any right or 
interest of a third person. 
 
(e) Only lawful acts can be ratified. 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
523 
Classes of Agents 
Agents may be special or general or, they may be mercantile agents: 
 
(a) Special Agent: A special agent is one who is appointed to do a specified act, or to perform a 
specified function. He has no authority outside this special task. The third-party has no right to 
assume that the agent has unlimited authority. Any act of the agent beyond that authority will not 
bind the principal. 
 
(b) General Agent: A general agent is appointed to do anything within the authority given to him by the 
principal in all transactions, or in all transactions relating to a specified trade or matter. The third-
party may assume that such an agent has power to do all that is usual for a general agent to do in 
the business involved. The third party is not affected by any private restrictions on the agents 
authority. 
Sub-Agent 
A person who is appointed by the agent and to whom the principal’s work is delegated to known as sub-
agent. Section 191 provides that “a sub-agent is a person employed by, and acting under the control of the 
original agent in the business of the agency.” So, the sub-agent is the agent of the original agent. 
As between themselves, the relation of sub-agent and original agent is that of agent and the principal. A sub-
agent is bound by all the duties of the original agent. The sub-agent is not directly responsible to the principal 
except for fraud and wilful wrong. The sub-agent is responsible to the original agent. The original agent is 
responsible to the principal for the acts of the sub-agent. As regards third persons, the principal is 
represented by sub-agent and he is bound and responsible for all the acts of sub-agent as if he were an 
agent originally appointed by the principal. 
Mercantile Agents 
Section 2(9) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, defines a mercantile agent as “a mercantile agent having in the 
customary course of business as such agent authority either to sell goods or consign goods for the purposes 
of sale, or to buy goods, or to raise money on the security of goods”. This definition covers factors, brokers, 
auctioneers, commission agents etc. 
Factors 
A factor is a mercantile agent employed to sell goods which have been placed in his possession or contract 
to buy goods for his principal. He is the apparent owner of the goods in his custody and can sell them in his 
own name and receive payment for the goods. He has an insurable interest in the goods and also a general 
lien in respect of any claim he may have arising out of the agency. 
Brokers 
A broker is a mercantile agent whose ordinary course of business is to make contracts with other parties for 
the sale and purchase of goods and securities of which he is not entrusted with the possession for a 
commission called brokerage. He acts in the name of principal. He has no lien over the goods as he is not in 
possession of them. 
Del CredereAgent 
A del credere agent is a mercantile agent, who is in consideration of an extra remuneration guarantees to his 
principal that the purchasers who buy on credit will pay for the goods they take. In the event of a third-party 
failing to pay, the del credere agent is bound to pay his principal the sum owned by third-party. 
EP-EBCL 
524 
Auctioneers 
An auctioneer is an agent who sells goods by auction, i.e., to the highest bidder in public competition. He has 
no authority to warrant his principals title to the goods. He is an agent for the seller but after the goods have 
been knocked down he is agent for the buyer also for the purpose of evidence that the sale has taken place. 
Partners 
In a partnership firm, every partner is an agent of the firm and of his co-partners for the purpose of the 
business of the firm. 
Bankers 
The relationship between a banker and his customer is primarily that of debtor and creditor. In addition, a 
banker is an agent of his customer when he buys or sells securities, collects cheques dividends, bills or 
promissory notes on behalf of his customer. He has a general lien on all securities and goods in his 
possession in respect of the general balance due to him by the customer. 
Duties of the Agent 
An agent’s duties towards his principal are as follows (which give corresponding rights to the principal who 
may sue for damages in the event of a breach of duty by the agent): 
 
(a) An agent must act within the scope of the authority conferred upon him and carry out strictly the 
instructions of the principal (Section 211). 
 
(b) in the absence of express instructions, he must follow the custom prevailing in the same kind of 
business at the place where the agent conducts the business (Section 211). 
 
(c) He must do the work with reasonable skill and diligence whereby the nature of his profession, the 
agent purports to have special skill, he must exercise the skill which is expected from the members 
of the profession (Section 212). 
 
(d) He must disclose promptly any material information coming to his knowledge which is likely to 
influence the principal in the making of the contract. 
 
(e) He must not disclose confidential information entrusted to him by his principal (Section 213). 
 
(f) He must not allow his interest to conflict with his duty, e.g., he must not compete with his principal 
(Section 215). 
 
(g) The agent must keep true accounts and must be prepared on reasonable notice to render an 
account. 
 
(h) He must not make any secret profit; he must disclose any extra profit that he may make. 
 
 Where an agent is discovered taking secret bribe, etc., the principal is entitled to (i) dismiss the 
agent without notice, (ii) recover the amount of secret profit, and (iii) refuse to pay the agent his 
remuneration. He may repudiate the contract, if the third-party is involved in secret profit and also 
recover damages. 
 
(i) An agent must not delegate his authority to sub-agent. A sub-agent is a person employed by and 
acting under the control of the original agent in the business of agency (Section 191). This rule is 
based on the principle: Delegatus non-potest delegare — a delegate cannot further delegate 
(Section 190). 
 
 But there are exceptions to this rule and the agent may delegate (i) where delegation is allowed by 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
525 
the principal, (ii) where the trade custom or usage sanctions delegation, (iii) where delegation is 
essential for proper performance, (iv) where an emergency renders it imperative, (v) where nature 
of the work is purely ministerial, and (vi) where the principal knows that the agent intends to 
delegate. 
Rights of Agents 
Where the services rendered by the agent are not gratuitous or voluntary, the agent is entitled to receive the 
agreed remuneration, or if none was agreed, a reasonable remuneration. The agent becomes entitled to 
receive remuneration as soon as he has done what he had undertaken to do (Section 219). 
Certain classes of agents, e.g., factors who have goods and property of their principal in their possession, 
have a lien on the goods or property in respect of their remuneration and expense and liabilities incurred. He 
has a right to stop the goods in transit where he is an unpaid seller. 
As the agent represents the principal, the agent has a right to be indemnified by the principal against all 
charges, expenses and liabilities properly incurred by him in the course of the agency (Sections 222-223). 
Extent of Agent’s Authority 
The extent of the authority of an agent depends upon the terms expressed in his appointment or it may be 
implied by the circumstances of the case. The contractual authority is the real authority, but implied authority 
is to do whatevers incidental to carry out the real authority. This implied authority is also known as apparent 
or ostensible authority, Thus, an agent having an authority to do an act has authority to do everything lawful 
which is necessary for the purpose or usually done in the course of conducting business. 
An agent has authority to do all such things which may be necessary to protect the principal from loss in an 
emergency and which he would do to protect his own property under similar circumstances. Where butter 
was becoming useless owing to delay in transit and was therefore sold by the station master for the best 
price available as it was not possible to obtain instructions from the principal, the sale was held binding upon 
the principal. 
Responsibilities of Principal to Third-parties 
The effect of a contract made by an agent varies according to the circumstances under which the agent 
contracted. There are three circumstances in which an agent may contract, namely— 
 
(i) the agent acts for a named principal; 
 
(ii) the agent acts for an undisclosed principal; and 
 
(iii) the agent acts for a concealed principal. 
(a) Disclosed principal: Where the agent contracts as agent for a named principal, he generally incurs neither 
rights nor liabilities under the contract, and drops out as soon as it is made. The contract is made between 
the principal and the third-party and it is between these two that rights and obligations are created. The legal 
effect is the same as if the principal had contracted directly with the third-party. 
The effect is that the principal is bound by all acts of the agent done within the scope of actual, apparent or 
ostensible authority. This ostensible authority of the agent is important, for the acts of a general agent are 
binding on the principal if they are within the scope of his apparent authority, although they may be outside 
the scope of his actual authority. Therefore, a private or secret limitation or restriction of powers of an agent 
do not bind innocent third-party. 
EP-EBCL 
526 
(b) Undisclosed principal: Where the agent disclose that he is merely an agent but conceals the identity of 
his principal, he is not personally liable, as he drops out in normal way. The principal, on being discovered, 
will be responsible for the contract made by the agent. 
(c) Concealed principal: Where an agent appears to be contracting on his own behalf, without either 
contracting as an agent or disclosing the existence of an agency (i.e., he discloses neither the name of the 
principal nor his existence), he becomes personally liable. The third-party may sue either the principal (when 
discovered) or the agent or both. If the third-party chooses to sue the principal and not the agent, he must 
allow the principal the benefit of all payments made by him to the agent on account of the contract before the 
agency was disclosed. The third-party is also entitled to get the benefit of anything he may have paid to the 
agent. 
If the principal discloses himself before the contract is completed, the other contracting party may refuse to 
fulfil the contract if he can show that, if he had known who was the principal in the contract, or if he had 
known that the agent was not the principal, he would not have entered into the contract. 
Principal Liable for Agent’s Torts (Section 238) 
If an agent commits a tort or other wrong (e.g., misrepresentation or fraud) during his agency, whilst acting 
within the scope of his actual or apparent authority, the principal is liable. But the agent is also personally 
liable, and he may be sued also. The principal is liable even if the tort is committed exclusively for the benefit 
of the agent and against the interests of the principal. 
Personal Liability of Agent to Third-party 
An agent is personally liable in the following cases: 
 
(a) Where the agent has agreed to be personally liable to the third-party. 
 
(b) Where an agent acts for a principal residing abroad. 
 
(c) When the agent signs a negotiable instrument in his own name without making it clear that he is 
signing it only as agent. 
 
(d) When an agent acts for a principal who cannot be sued (e.g., he is minor), the agent is personally 
liable. 
 
(e) An agent is liable for breach of warranty of authority. Where a person contracts as agent without 
any authority there is a breach of warranty of authority. He is liable to the person who has relied on 
the warranty of authority and has suffered loss. 
 
(f) Where authority is one coupled with interest or where trade, usage or custom makes the agent 
personally liable, he will be liable to the third-party. 
 
(g) He is also liable for his torts committed in the course of agency. 
Meaning of Authority Coupled with Interest (Section 202) 
An agency is coupled with an interest when the agent has an interest in the authority granted to him or when 
the agent has an interest in the subject matter with which he is authorised to deal. Where the agent was 
appointed to enable him to secure some benefit already owed to him by the principal, the agency was 
coupled with an interest. For example, where a factor had made advances to the principal and is authorised 
to sell at the best price and recoup the advances made by him or where the agent is authorised to collect 
money from third-parties and pay himself the debt due by the principal, the agencies are coupled with 
interest. But a mere arrangement that the agent’s remuneration to paid out of the rents collected by him, it 
                                                                       Lesson 20        Indian Contract Act, 1872 
527 
does not give him any interest in the property and the agency is not the one coupled with an interest. An 
agency coupled with interest cannot be terminated in the absence of a contract to the contrary to the 
prejudice of such interest. 
The principal laid down in Section 202 applies only if the following conditions are fulfilled: 
 
(i) The interest of the agent should exist at the time of creation of agency and should not have arisen 
after the creation of agency. 
 
(ii) Authority given to the agent must be intended for the protection of the interest of the agent. 
 
(iii) The interest of the agent in the subject matter must be substantial and not ordinary. 
 
(iv) The interest of the agent should be over and above his remuneration. Mere prospect of 
remuneration is not sufficient interest. 
Termination of Agency 
An agency comes to an end or terminates— 
 
(a) By the performance of the contract of agency; (Section 201) 
 
(b) By an agreement between the principal and the agent; 
 
(c) By expiration of the period fixed for the contract of agency; 
 
(d) By the death of the principal or the agency; (Section 201) 
 
(e) By the insanity of either the principal or the agent; (Section 201) 
 
(f) By the insolvency of the principal, and in some cases that of the agent; (Section 201) 
 
(g) Where the principal or agent is an incorporated company, by its dissolution; 
 
(h) By the destruction of the subject-matter; (Section 56) 
 
(i) By the renunciation of his authority by the agent; (Section 201) 
 
(j) By the revocation of authority by the principal. (Section 201) 
When Agency is Irrevocable 
Revocation of an agency by the principal is not possible in the following cases: 
 
(a) Where the authority of agency is one coupled with an interest, even the death or insanity of the 
principal does not terminate the authority in this case (Section 202). 
 
(b) When agent has incurred personal liability, the agency becomes irrevocable. 
 
(c) When the authority has been partly exercised by the agent, it is irrevocable in particular with regard 
to obligations which arise from acts already done (Section 204). 
When Termination Takes Effect 
Termination of an agency takes effect or is complete, as regards the agent when it becomes known to the 
agent. If the principal revokes the agents authority, the revocation will take effect when the agent comes to 
know of it. As regards the third-parties, the termination takes effect when it comes to their knowledge 
(Section 208). Thus, if an agent whose authority has been terminated to his knowledge, enters into a 
contract with a third-party who deals with him bona fide, the contract will be binding on the principal as 
against the third-party. The termination of an agent’s authority terminates the authority of the sub-agent 
appointed by the agent (Section 210). 
EP-EBCL 
528 
The revocation of agency as regards the agent and as regards the principal takes effect at different points of 
time. Section 209 charges the agent with duty to protect the principal’s interest where the principal dies or 
becomes of unsound mind. It provides that when an agency is terminated by the principal dying or becoming 
of unsound mind, the agent is bound to take, on behalf of the representatives of his late principal, all 
reasonable steps for the protection and preservation of the interest entrusted to him. So it is the duty of the 
agent to take all steps to protect the interest of his deceased principal on his death. 
JOINT VENTURE/ FOREIGN COLLABORATION/MULTINATIONAL AGREEMENTS 
International business professionals use the term “modes of entry” to describe the different methods and 
approaches available to enter markets and conduct business in other countries. One mode of entry is the 
joint venture where two or more organizations join together in a cooperative effort to further their business 
goals. The joint venture is one of the most common and effective means of conducting business 
internationally. The joint venture documents and agreements are critical to the success of the venture. The 
joint venture agreement forms the basis of the understanding between and among the parties. It is relied 
upon to ensure that all parties understand their roles, rights, responsibilities, and remedies in the conduct of 
the venture. Organizations enter into joint ventures in good faith but closely scrutinize the joint venture 
documents if anything goes awry. 
The importance of the documents and the purpose of this part is to cover, step by step, the critical elements 
to consider and include in joint venture agreements. Equity participation, for example, may or may not be as 
important as operational control. Technical participation in the venture may or may not be as important as the 
intellectual property rights that may result from the venture. A key to developing joint venture agreements is 
to determine goals and objectives in advance and ensure that the interests are reflected in the agreement. 
Selection of a good local partner is the key to the success of any joint venture. Personal interviews with a 
prospective joint venture partner should be supplemented with proper due diligence. Once a partner is 
selected generally the parties highlighting the basis of the future joint venture agreement sign a 
memorandum of understanding or a letter of intent. Before signing the joint venture agreement, the terms 
should be thoroughly discussed to avoid any misunderstanding at a later stage. Negotiations require an 
understanding of the cultural and legal background of the parties. 
It is difficult to prepare a set frame of the terms and conditions. The conditions may differ according to the 
requirements. While drafting a foreign collaboration agreement, the following factors should be kept in mind: 
 
▬ Capability of the collaborator and the requirements of the party are clearly indicated. 
 
▬ Clear definitions of technical terms are given.

E-CONTRACT  
Electronic contracts are not paper based but rather in electronic form are born out of the need for speed, 
convenience and efficiency. In the electronic age, the whole transaction can be completed in seconds, with 
both parties simply affixing their digital signatures to an electronic copy of the contract. There was initially an 
apprehension amongst the legislatures to recognize this modern technology, but now many countries have 
enacted laws to recognize electronic contracts. The conventional law relating to contracts is not sufficient to 
address all the issues that arise in electronic contracts. The Information Technology Act, 2000 solves some 
of the peculiar issues that arise in the formation and authentication of electronic contracts 
As in every other contract, an electronic contract also requires the following necessary ingredients: 
An offer needs to be made 
The offer needs to be accepted 
There has to be lawful consideration 
There has to be an intention to create legal relations 
The parties must be competent to contract 
There must be free and genuine consent 
The object of the contract must be lawful 
There must be certainty and possibility of performance.  
LESSON ROUND-UP 
• A contract is an agreement enforceable at law, made between two or more persons, by which rights are 
acquired by one or more to acts or forbearances on the part of the other or others. 
• Every promise and every set of promises, forming the consideration for each other, is an agreement. 
• All agreements are contracts if they are made by the free consent of parties competent to contract, for a 
lawful consideration and with a lawful object, and are not hereby expressly declared to be void. 
EP-EBCL

• In flaw contract There may be the circumstances under which a contract made under these rules may still 
be bad, because there is a flaw, vice or error somewhere. As a result of such a flaw, the apparent 
agreement is not a real agreement. 
• Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act states that every agreement by which any one is restrained from 
exercising a lawful profession, trade or business of any kind, is, to that extent, void. 
• The literal meaning of the word “wager” is a “bet”. Wagerning agreements are nothing but ordinary betting 
agreements. 
• An agreement not enforceable by law is void ab initio. 
• A contingent contract is a contract to do or not to do something, if some event collateral to such contract, 
does or does not happen. Contract of insurance and contracts of indemnity and guarantee are popular 
instances of contingent contracts. 
• A quasi-contract rests on the equitable principle that a person shall not be allowed to enrich himself unjustly 
at the expense of another. In truth, it is not a contract at all. It is an obligation which the law creates, in the 
absence of any agreement, when any person is in the possession of one persons money, or its equivalent, 
under such circumstances that in equity and good conscience he ought not to retain it, and which in justice 
and fairness belongs to another. It is the duty and not an agreement or intention which defines it. 
• A contract is said to be discharged or terminated when the rights and obligations arising out of a contract 
are extinguished. 
• Where a contract is broken, the injured party has several courses of action open to him. The appropriate 
remedy in any case will depend upon the subject-matter of the contract and the nature of the breach. 
• A contract of indemnity is a contract by which one party promises to save the other party from loss caused 
to him by the conduct of the promisor himself, or by the conduct of any other person. 
• A bailment is a transaction whereby one person delivers goods to another person for some purpose, upon a 
contract that they are, when the purpose is accomplished to be returned or otherwise disposed of according 
to the directions of the person delivering them.

INTRODUCTION 
The law relating to specific relief in India is provided in the Specific Relief Act of 1963. The Specific Relief 
Act, 1963 was enacted to define and amend the law relating to certain kinds of specific relief. 
The expression ‘specific relief’ means a relief in specie. It is a remedy which aims at the exact fulfillment of 
an obligation. 
Scope of the Act 
The Specific Relief Act, 1963 is not exhaustive. It does not consolidate the whole law on the subject. As the 
Preamble would indicate, it is an Act ”to define and amend the law relating to certain kinds of specific relief”. 
It does not purport to lay down the law relating to specific relief in all its ramifications (AIR 1972 SC 1826) 
There are other kinds of specific remedy provided for by other enactments e.g. the Transfer of Property Act 
deals with the specific remedies available to a mortgagor or mortgagee; the Partnership Act deals with the 
specific remedies like dissolution and accounts as between partners. 
Under the Specific Relief Act, 1963, remedies have been divided as specific relief (Sections 5-35) and 
preventive relief (Sections 36-42). These are: 
 
(i) Recovering possession of property (Sections 5-8); 
 
(ii) Specific performance of contracts (Sections 9-25); 
 
(iii) Rectification of Instruments (Section 26); 
 
(iv) Rescission of contracts (Sections 27-30); 
 
(v) Cancellation of Instruments (Section 31-33); 
 
(vi) Declaratory decrees (Sections 34-35); and 
 (vii) Injunctions (Sections 36-42). 
Who May Sue for Specific Performance 
Section 15 lays down that specific performance of a contract may be obtained by (a) any party thereto; (b) 
the representative in interest or the principal, of any party thereto; provided that where the learning, skill, 
insolvency or any personal quality of such party is a material ingredient in the contract, or where the contract 
provides that his interest shall not be assigned, his representative in interest or his principal shall not be 
entitled to specific performance of the contract, unless such party has already performed his part of the 
contract, or the performance thereof by his representative in interest, or his principal, has been accepted by 
the other party; (c) where the contract is a settlement on marriage, or a compromise of doubtful rights 
between members of the same family, any person beneficially entitled thereunder; (d) where the contract has 
been entered into by tenant-for-life in due exercise of a power the remainder man; (e) a reversioner in 
possession, where the agreement is a convenant entered into with his predecessor in title and the 
reversioner is entitled to the benefit of such convenant; (f) a reversioner in remainder, where the agreement 
is such a covenant, and the reversioner is entitled to the benefit thereof and will sustain material injury by 
reason of its breach; (g) when a company has entered into a contract and subsequently becomes 
amalgamated with another company the new company which arises out of the amalgamation; (h) when the 
promoters of a company have, before its incorporation, entered into a contract for the purpose of the 
company and such a contract is warranted by the terms of the incorporation of the company provided that 
the company has accepted the contract and has communicated such acceptance to the other party to the 
contract. 
                                                                       Lesson 21        Specific Relief Act, 1963 533 
Generally, only a party to the contract can get its specific performance. The section gives the list of persons 
who can sue for specific performance of a contract. The general principle is that in a suit for specific 
performance of a contract, all the parties to the contract should be parties to the suit and no one else. 
Contracts which can be specifically enforced 
Section 10 provides the cases in which specific performance of contract is enforceable. It says that except as 
otherwise provided in this Chapter, the specific performance of any contract may, in the discretion of the 
Court, be enforced (a) when there exists no standard for ascertaining the actual damage caused by the non-
performance of the act agreed to be done, or (b) when the act agreed to be done is such that compensation 
in money for its non-performance would not afford adequate relief. The explanation provides that unless and 
until the contrary is proved, the Court shall presume: 
(i) that the breach of a contract to transfer immovable property cannot be adequately relieved by 
compensation in money, and (ii) that the breach of a contract to transfer movable property can be so relieved 
except in the two cases: (a) where the property is not an ordinary article of commerce or is of special value 
or interest to the plaintiff, or consists of goods which are not easily obtainable in the market, and (b) where 
the property is held by the defendant as the agent or trustee of the plaintiff. 
So, under this Section, contracts for sale of patent right, copy right, shares of a company which are not easily 
available, future property, chattels of special value, etc., are specifically enforceable. In an agreement for 
sale of agricultural land, the respondent vendor wilfully avoided the execution of sale deed after receiving full 
sale consideration. Rajasthan High Court held that compensation by way of damages would not be 
substituted to execution of sale deed. The Court directed the respondents to enforce the specific 
performance of the agreement (Ram Karan and others v. Govind Lal and other, AIR 1999 Raj. 167). In a suit 
for specific performance of contract of sale of a house, a stranger to the contract cannot seek to be 
impleaded. That will change the very nature of the suit. 
Cases in which specific performance of contracts connected with trusts enforceable 
Section 11 lays down that except as otherwise provided in this Act, specific performance of a contract may, 
in the discretion of the Court, be enforced when the act agreed to be done is in the performance wholly or 
partly of a trust. But if a trustee enters into a contract in excess of his powers then such a contract cannot be 
specifically enforced. 
Illustrations 
A contracts with B to paint a picture for B and B agrees to pay Rs. 1000 for the same. The picture is painted. 
‘B’ is entitled to have it delivered to him on payment or tender of Rs. 1,000. 
A is a trustee of land with power of lease it for 7 years. He enters into a contract with B to grant a lease of the 
land for 7 years, with a covenant to renew the lease at the expiry of the term. This contract cannot be 
specifically enforced. 
The directors of company have power to sell the concern with the sanction of a general meeting of the 
shareholders, Directors contract to sell it without any such sanction. This contract cannot be specifically 
enforced. 
Specific performance of part of a contract 
Section 12 deals with specific performance of a part of a contract. Sub-section (1) lays down the general 
principle that except as otherwise hereinafter provided in this section, the Court shall not direct the specific 
EP-EBCL 
534 
performance of a part of a contract. Sub-sections (2)-(4) lay down the exceptions to this general rule as 
follows: 
(i) Sub-section 2 says that where a party to a contract is unable to perform the whole of his part of it, but the 
part which must be left unperformed by only a small proportion to the whole in value and admits of 
compensation in money, the Court may, at the suit of the either party, direct the specific performance of so 
much of the contract as can be performed and award compensation in money for the deficiency. 
A contracts to sell B a piece of land consisting of 100 bighas. It turns out that 98 bighas of the land belongs 
to A and the two remaining bighas to a stranger, who refuses to part with them. The two bighas are not 
necessary for the use of enjoyment of the 98 bighas, nor so important for such use or enjoyment that the loss 
of them may not be made in goods in money. A may be directed at the suit of B to convey to B the 98 bighas 
and to make compensation to him. For not conveying the two remaining bighas; B may be directed at the suit 
of A, to pay to A, on receiving the conveyance and possession of the land, the stipulated purchase money 
less the sum awarded as compensation for the deficiency. 
(ii) Sub-section 3 lays down that where a party to a contract is unable to perform the whole of his part of it, 
and the part which must be left unperformed either (a) forms a considerable part of the whole, though 
admitting of compensation in money; or (b) does not admit of compensation in money; he is not entitled to 
obtain a decree for specific performance; but the Court may, at the suit of the other party, direct the party in 
default to perform specifically so much of his part of the contract as he can perform, if the party (i) in a case 
falling under clause (a), pays or has paid the agreed consideration for the whole of the contract reduced by 
the consideration for the part which must be left unperformed and in a case falling under clause (b), pays or 
has paid the consideration for the whole of the contract without any abatement, and (ii) in either case, 
relinquishes all claims to the performance of the remaining part of the contract and all rights to 
compensation, either for the deficiency or for the loss or damage sustained by him through the default of the 
defendant. 
For 
example, 
A 
contracts 
to 
sell 
B 
a 
piece 
of 
land 
consisting 
of 
100 
bighas 
for  
Rs. 1,00,000. It turns out that only 50 bighas of land belong to A. 50 bighas are substantial part of the 
contract. A cannot demand specific performance of the contract but B can demand specific performance to 
get 50 bighas of land from A by paying the full consideration i.e. Rs. 1,00,000. 
(iii) Sub-section 4 lays down that when a part of a contract which taken by itself, can and ought to be 
specifically performed, stands on a separate and independent footing from another part of the same contract 
which cannot or ought not to be specifically performed, the Court may direct specific performance of the 
former part. For the purposes of this section, a party to the contract shall be deemed to be unable to perform 
the whole of his part of it, if a portion of its subject matter existing at the date of the contract has ceased to 
exist at the time of its performance. 
Section 13 lays down the rights of a purchaser or lessee against the seller or lessor with no title or imperfect 
title. It lays down that where a person contracts to sell or let certain immovable property having no title or 
only an imperfect title, the purchaser or lessee (subject to the other provisions of this Chapter) has the 
following rights, namely: (a) if the vendor or lessor has, subsequent to the contract, acquired any interest in 
the property, the purchaser or lessee may compel him to make good the contract out of such interest; (b) 
where the concurrence of other persons is necessary for validating the title, and they are bound to convey at 
the request of the vendor or lessor, the purchaser or lessee may compel him to procure such concurrence 
and when conveyance by other person is necessary to validate the title and they are bound to convey at the 
request of the vendor or lessor, the purchaser or lessee may compel him to procure such conveyance; (c) 
where the vendor professes to sell unencumbered property but the property is, mortgaged for an amount not 
                                                                       Lesson 21        Specific Relief Act, 1963 535 
exceeding the purchase money and the vendor has in fact only a right to redeem it, the purchaser may 
compel him to redeem the mortgage and to obtain a valid discharge, and, where necessary, also a 
conveyance from the mortgagee; (d) where the vendor or lessor sues for specific performance of the contract 
and the suit is dismissed on the ground of his want of title, or imperfect title, the defendant has a right to a 
return of his deposit, interest and costs on the interest, if any, of the vendor or lessor in the property which is 
the subject matter of the contract. Sub-section (2) of Section 13 lays down that the aforesaid provisions of 
the sections shall also supply, as far as may be to contracts for or hire of movable property. 
Contracts which cannot be specifically enforced 
Section 14 lays down the contracts which cannot be specifically enforced. They are (a) A contract for the 
non-performance of which compensation in money is an adequate relief; (b) A contract which runs into such 
minute and numerous details that the Court cannot enforce specific performance of its material terms or 
which is dependant upon the personal qualification or volition of the parties or a contract from its nature is 
such that the Court cannot enforce specific performance; (c) A contract which is in its nature determinable; 
(d) A contract, the performance of which involves the performance of a continuous duty which the court 
cannot supervise. Sub-section (2) lays down that save as provided by the Arbitration Act, 1943, no contract 
to refer present or future difference to arbitration shall be specifically enforced; but if any person who has 
made such a contract (other than an arbitration agreement to which the provisions for the said Act apply) and 
has refused to perform it, sues in respect of any subject which he has contracted to refer, the existence of 
such a contract shall bar the suit. 
Sub-section (3) lays down that notwithstanding anything contained in clause (a) or clause (c) or clause (d) of 
Sub-section (1), the Court may enforce specific performance in the following cases: (a) where the suit is for 
the enforcement of a contract—(i) to execute a mortage or furnish any other security for securiing the 
repayment of any loan which the borrower is not willing to repay at once; provided that where only a part of 
the loan has been advanced the vendor is willing to advance the remaining part of the loan in terms of the 
contract; or (ii) to take up and pay for any debentures of a company; (b) where the suit is for (i) the execution 
of a formal deed of partnership, the parties having commenced to carry on the business, or (ii) the purchase 
of a share of a partner of a firm (c) where the suit is for the enforcement of a contract for the construction of 
any building or the execution of any other work on land provided that the following conditions are fulfilled, 
namely, (i) the building or other work is described in the contract in terms sufficiently precise to enable the 
Court to determine the exact nature of the building or work; (ii) the plaintiff has a substantial interest in the 
performance of the contract and the interest is of such a nature that compensation in money for non-
performance of the contract is not an adequate relief; and (iii) the defendant has, in pursuance of the 
contract, obtained possession of the land on which the building is to be constructed or other work is to be 
executed. 
Illustrations 
A contracts to sell and B contracts to buy, one lakh of rupees in the four per cent Central Government loan; 
the contract may be specifically performed. 
A contracts to render personal service to B or A contracts to marry B or A contracts to employ B on personal 
service or A, an author, contracts with B, a publisher to complete a literary work. B cannot enforce specific 
performance of these contracts. Not only contract of personal service, but any contract requiring personal 
skill, knowledge or volition of the parties, for example, to marry, to paint a picture, to complete a literary work 
or to sing or act at a theatre will not be specifically enforced as such contracts would require a constant and 
general superintendence as cannot be conveniently undertaken by a Court of Justice. 
EP-EBCL 
536 
A and B contract to become partners, the contract is not specifying the duration of the proposed partnership. 
In such a case the contract cannot be specifically enforced since, either A and B might at once dissolve the 
partnership (Scott v. Rayment (1868) L.R. 7 Eq. 112). 
The Court will not decree specific performance of an agreement if it be of such a nature that better justice will 
be done by leaving the parties to their remedy in damages (Wilson v. Northampton & Banbury Junction Rly. 
Co. (1874) 9 C.H. App. 279).  
The very foundation of specific performance of a contract is that an award for damages does not afford the 
aggrieved party a complete remedy. If in the opinion of the Court damages will be an adequate remedy, 
specific performance of the contract cannot be decreed (Ramji Patel v. Rao Kishore, (1929) P.C. 190).  
In such a case pecuniary compensation is equated with the specific performance of the contract. It can be 
decreed only when the remedy at law is not adequate or is defective. The court may come to the conclusion 
that the ends of justice will be served better by awarding the damages instead of the specific performance of 
the contract. 
A Contract may be specifically enforced: 
 
(a) If it is one for non-performance of which the mere payment of money would not be an adequate 
relief; and 
 
(b) the contract is otherwise, proper to be specifically enforced. Section 14(1)(b) provides three reasons 
for refusing specific performance: 
 
(i) When a contract runs into minute or numerous details; or 
 
(ii) When a contract is dependent upon the personal qualification or volition of the parties; or 
 
(iii) When the contract by nature is such that the Court cannot enforce, specific performance of its 
material terms. 
In the same way, contracts of personal service cannot be specifically enforced. These contracts are based 
upon the personal relations of the parties. They require mutual trust and confidence of the parties. When the 
contract is for personal service, it requires some skill or talent or of some intellectual pursuit, and in that case 
a decree for its specific performance cannot be passed by the court, as it will never know if the decree has 
been truthfully and fully executed. The Court will refuse specific performance of a contract if it is of such a 
nature that the Court cannot enforce its specific performance. 
Under Section 14(1)(c) contracts which are in their nature determinable cannot be specifically enforced. 
The Court will not enforce a contract which is in its nature determinable by the defendant. Determinable 
contract is such a contract where one of the parties can put an end to it. So even if a decree is passed, the 
defendant by putting an end to the contract, will evade the decree. A and B contract to become partners in a 
certain business, the contract not specifying the duration of the proposed partnership can not be specifically 
performed, for if it were so performed, either A or B might at once dissolve the partnership. 
Recovery of Possession of Movable and Immovable Property 
Sections 5 to 8 deal with recovery of possession of property. Property may either be (i) immovable, or (ii) 
movable. Sections 5 and 6 deal with recovery of possession of immovable property while Sections 7 and 8 
deal with movable property. 
                                                                       Lesson 21        Specific Relief Act, 1963 537 
Recovery of possession of specific immovable property 
According to Section 5, a person, entitled to the possession of specific immovable property may recover the 
same in the manner provided by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The word ‘person’ includes any 
company or association or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not. The action under Section 5 
arises when claim is made on the basis of “title”. 
RECOVERY OF POSSESSION OF DISPOSSESSED IMMOVABLE PROPERTY 
The Act provides another relief under Section 6 for the recovery of possession of immovable property where 
the claim is based merely on ‘possession’. Section 6 provides that if any person is dispossessed without his 
consent, of immovable property otherwise than in due course of Law, he or any person claiming through him 
may be suit recover possession thereof, notwithstanding any other title that may be set up in such a suit. 
There are two restrictions; no suit under Section 6 shall be brought (i) after the expiry of 6 months from the 
date of dispossession, or (ii) against the Government. Under Sub-section (3) no appeal or review is allowed 
of any order of decree passed under this Section. Sub-section (4) allows a person to file a suit to establish 
his title to such property and recover possession thereof. 
The object of these provisions is to discourage people from taking the law into their own hands. The Sections 
provide a speedy and summary remedy through a medium of Civil Court for restoration of possession to the 
dispossed. Section 5 thus provides for a suit for ejectment on the basis of title and Section 6 gives a remedy 
without establishing title provided the suit is brought within 6 months of the date of possession. The object of 
Section 6 is to discourage forcible dispossession and to enable the person dispossessed to recover 
possession by merely providing previous possession and wrongful dispossession without proving title 
(Lachman v. Shambu Narain, ILR (1911) 33 ALL 174). A suit under Section 6 is maintainable between 
landlords and tenants. Heirs are also entitled to sue for recovery of possession. 
Recovery of specific movable property 
A person is entitled to recover the possession of specific movable property in the manner provided by the 
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. (Section 7) 
Explanation 1: A trustee may sue for possession of movable property of which he is a trustee. The term 
‘trustee’ includes every person holding property in trust. 
Explanation 2: A special or temporary right to the present possession of movable property is sufficient to 
support a suit under this section. 
Illustrations 
 
(a)  A bequeaths land to B for his life, with remainder to C. A dies, B enters on the land, but C, without 
B’s consent, obtains possession of the title deeds, B may recover them from C. 
 
(b)  A pledges certain jewels to B to secure a loan. B disposes of them before he is entitled to do so. A, 
without having paid or tendered the amount of the loan, sues B for possession of the jewels. The 
suit should be dismissed, as A is not entitled to their possession, whatever right he may have to 
secure their safe custody (See Donald v. Suckling (1866) L.R. 1 Q.B. 585). 
 
(c)  A receives a letter addressed to him by B. B gets back the letter without A’s consent. A has such a 
property therein as entitles him to recover it from B (Oliver v. Oliver (1861) 11 C.B.N.S. 139). 
 
(d)  A deposits books and papers for safe custody with B. B losses them and C finds them, but refuses 
to deliver them to B when demanded. B may recover them from C, subject to C’s right, if any, under 
Section 168 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.

(e)  A, a warehouse-keeper, is charged with the delivery of certain goods to Z, which B takes out of A’s 
possession. A may sue B for the goods. 
An action in detinue would lie only for some specific article of movable property capable of being recovered 
in specie and of being seized and delivered up to the winning party. Section 7 lays down that a person 
entitled to the possession of specific movable property may recover the same in the manner prescribed by 
the Civil Procedure Code. A trustee or a person having a special or a temporary right to the present 
possession may also file a suit under this section. 
Liability of person in possession, not as owner to deliver to persons entitled to immediate 
possession 
Section 8 lays down that any person having the possession or control of a particular article of movable 
property of which he is not the owner, may be compelled specifically, to deliver it to the person entitled to its 
immediate possession in any of the following four cases: 
 
(a) When the thing claimed is held by the defendant as the agent or trustee of the plaintiff, 
 
(b) when the compensation in money would not afford the plaintiff adequate relief for the loss of the 
thing claimed, 
 
(c) when it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the actual damage caused by its loss, 
 
(d) when the possession of the thing claimed has been wrongfully transferred from the plaintiff. 
Unless and until the contrary is proved, the Court shall, in respect of any article of movable property claimed 
under clause (b) or (c) of this section presume that (i) compensation in money would not afford the plaintiff 
adequate relief for the loss of the thing claimed or as the case may be, and (ii) it would be extremely difficult 
to ascertain the actual damage caused by its loss. 
Thus under this part of the Act, if a person, who has been dispossessed, does not bring a suit under Section 
6 of the Specific Relief Act within 6 months, he may still bring a suit for recovery alleging any title to the 
property. But in this case, the suit may be defeated by the defendant by proving a better title. 
Illustrations 
 
(a)  A, proceeding to Europe, leaves his furniture in charge of B, as his agent during his absence. B, 
without A’s authority, pledges the furniture to C, and C knowing that B had no right to pledge the 
furniture, advertises it for sale. C may be compelled to deliver the furniture to ‘A’ for he holds it as 
A’s trustee. 
 
(b)  Z has got possession of an idol belonging to A’s family, and of which A is the proper custodian. Z 
may be compelled to deliver the idol to A. 
 
(c)  ‘A’ is entitled to a picture by a dead painter and a pair of rare China vases. B has possession of 
them. The articles are of special character to bear an ascertainable market value. B may be 
compelled to deliver them to A. 
PERSONS AGAINST WHOM SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE AVAILABLE 
Section 15 lays down the parties who can bring an action for specific performance. 
According to Section 19, specific performance of a contract may be enforced against (a) either party thereto, 
(b) any person claiming under him, by a title arising subsequently to the contract except a transferee for 
value who has paid his money in good faith and without notice of the original contract, (c) any person 
claiming under a title which though prior to the contract, and known to the plaintiff, might have been 
displaced by the defendant, (d) when a company has entered into a contract and subsequently becomes 
                                                                       Lesson 21        Specific Relief Act, 1963 539 
amalgamated with another company — the new company which arises out of the amalgamation, (e) when 
the promoters of a company have before its incorporation entered into a contract, for the purpose of the 
company and such contract is warranted by the terms of the incorporation of the company; provided that the 
company has accepted the contract and communicated such acceptance to the other party to the contract. 
Clauses (a) and (b) embody the principle that Court will enforce specific performance of a contract not only 
against either party, thereto, but also against any person claiming under either of the parties, a title arising 
subsequently to the contract, except a transferee for value who has paid money in good faith and without 
notice of the original contract. 
Examples to clause (c) are voluntary alienness, joint tenants claiming survivorship and remainder man. 
PERSONS AGAINST WHOM SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE CANNOT BE ENFORCED 
Under Section 16, specific performance of a contract cannot be enforced in favour of a person — (a) who 
would not be entitled to recover compensation for its breach, or (b) who has became incapable of 
performing, or violates any essential term of the contract that on his part remains to be performed, or acts in 
fraud of the contract, or wilfully acts at variance with, or in subversion of, the relation intended to be 
established by the contract, or (c) who fails to aver and prove that he has performed or has always been 
ready and willing to perform the essential terms of the contract which are to be performed by him, other than 
terms the performance of which has been prevented or waived by the defendant. The obligation imposed by 
Section 16 of the Act is upon the Court not to grant specific performance to a plaintiff who has not met the 
requirements of clause (a), (b) and (c) thereof. 
Thus in a suit for specific performance the plaintiff should not only plead and prove the terms of the 
agreement but should also plead and prove his readiness and willingness to perform his obligations under 
the contract in terms of the contract. 
To adjudge whether the plaintiff is ready and willing to perform his part of the contract, the court must take 
into consideration the conduct of the plaintiff prior and subsequent to the filing of the suit along with other 
attending circumstances. Right from the date of the execution till the date of the decree he must prove that 
he is ready and has always been willing to perform his part of the contract. N.P. Thirgnanam v. Dr. R Jagan 
Mohan Rao, AIR 1996 SC 116, (1995) 5 SCC 115. 
The continuous readiness and willingness on the part of the plaintiff is a condition precedent to grant the 
relief of specific performance. The circumstance is material and relevant and is required to be considered by 
the Court while granting or refusing to grant the relief. If the plaintiff fails to either aver or prove the same he 
must fail. 
A Court may not, therefore, grant to a plaintiff who has failed to to prove that he has performed or has always 
been ready and willing to perform his part of the agreement, the specific performance whereof he seeks (See 
Ram Awadh v. Achhaibar Dubey, AIR 2000 SC 860).  
The explanation states that for the purpose of clause (c), (i) where a contract involved the payment of 
money, it is not essential for the plaintiff to actually tender to the defendant or to deposit in Court any money 
except when so directed by the Court (ii) the plaintiff must aver performance of, or readiness and willingness 
to perform, the contract according to its construction. 
Section 17 sets out two more cases where specific performance cannot be enforced in favour of a vendor or 
lessor. It states that a contract to sell or let any immovable property cannot be specifically enforced in favour of 
vendor or lessor (a) who knowing himself not to have any title to the property, has contracted to sell or let the 
property; (b) who, though he entered into the contract believing that he had a good title to the property, cannot 
at the time fixed by the parties or by the Court for the completion of the sale or letting, give the purchaser or 
lessee a title free from reasonable doubt sub-section (2) lays down that the provisions of Sub-section (1) shall 
also apply as far as may be, to contracts for the sale or hire of movable property. 
EP-EBCL 
540 
According to this Section, a contract to sell or hire property cannot be specifically enforced in favour of a 
seller or lessor if he had no title to the property. A person who knows that he has no title to the property but 
still enters into a contract with regard to that property, he cannot have the remedy of specific performance. It 
is the duty of the vendor to make a reasonable, clear and marketable title about which there must not be any 
rational doubt. 
Illustration 
A without C’s authority contracts to sell to B an estate which A knows to belong to C. A cannot enforce 
specific performance of this contract even though C is willing to confirm it. 
Non-enforcement except with variation 
According to Section 18, where a plaintiff seeks specific performance of a contract in writing, to which the 
defendant sets up a variation, the plaintiff cannot obtain the performance sought, except with the variation so 
set up in the following cases, namely: (a) where by fraud, mistake of fact or misrepresentation, the written 
contract of which performance is sought is in its terms or effect different from what the parties agreed to, or 
does not contain all the terms agreed to between the parties on the basis of which the defendant entered into 
the contract; (b) where the object of the parties was to produce a certain legal result which the contract as 
framed is not calculated to produce, (c) where the parties have subsequently to the execution of the contract, 
varied its terms. 
Illustration 
A contracts in writing to let a house to B for a certain term, at the rent of Rs. 100/- per month, putting it first 
into tenantable repair. The house turns out to be not worth repairing. So with B’s consent, A pulls it down and 
erects a new house in its place. B contracting orally to pay rent at Rs. 120/- per month. B then sues to 
enforce specific performance of the contract in writing. He cannot enforce it except with the variations made 
by the subsequent oral contract. 
DISCRETION OF THE COURT 
Sub-section (1) of Section 20 lays down that the jurisdiction to decree specific performance is discretionary, 
and the Court is not bound to grant such relief merely because it is lawful to do so, but the discretion of the 
Court is not arbitrary but based on sound and reasonable grounds guided by judicial principles and capable 
of correction by a Court of appeal. Sub-section (2) lays down that the following are cases in which the Court 
may properly exercise discretion not to decree specific performance —  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                       Lesson 21        Specific Relief Act, 1963 541 
Explanation 1 appended to the Section states that mere inadequacy of consideration, or the more fact that 
the contract is onerous to the defendant or improvident in its nature, shall not be deemed to constitute an 
unfair advantage within the meaning of clause (a) or hardship within the meaning of clause (b) Explanation 2 
to the Section says that the question whether the performance of a contract would involve hardship on the 
defendant within the meaning of clause (b) shall, except in cases where the hardship has resulted from any 
act of the plaintiff subsequent to the contract, be determined with reference to the circumstances existing at 
the time of the contract. 
Sub-section (3) lays down that Court may properly exercise discretion to decree specific performance in any 
case where the plaintiff has done substantial acts or suffered losses in consequences of a contract capable 
of specific performance. Sub-section (4) says that the court shall not refuse to any party specific performance 
of a contract merely on the ground that the contract is not enforceable at the instance of the other party. 
Specific performance is a discretionary remedy. The Court is not bound to decree specific performance 
merely because it is lawful to do so. Courts can take into consideration the conduct of the parties and the 
circumstances attending its execution and may exercise a discretion in granting or withholding a decree for 
specific performance (Jethalal v. Bachu, 47 Bom. 46). However, this discretion is not an arbitrary discretion 
but one governed by sound principles of equity. It has been held that the court is not bound to grant relief of 
specific performance even if it is lawful to do so. [Yellapa Sastri v. Gunda Shankara, AIR 2010 (NOC) 731 
A.P. See also AIR 2008 SC 1786]. 
Illustration 
In Dennev-light (1857) 8 D M & G 774, the Court refused specific performance against a buyer where the 
land contracted to be purchased was wholly surrounded by land belonging to others over which there was no 
right of way. 
It is to be noted that the word ‘mere’ has to be given due weight. Specific performance may be refused where 
inadequacy of consideration is coupled with some other factor not necessarily amounting to fraud, e.g. 
mistake, or surprise, or unfair advantage taken by the plaintiff of his superior knowledge or bargaining 
position even though the circumstances do not justify rescission of the contract. 
The hardship to be considered is at the time of the contract, unless the hardship has been brought on by the 
action of the plaintiff. Mere rise in price of the property agreed to be sold is not a ground for refusing a 
discretionary relief in favour of the purchaser. What has to be considered is the fairness of the contract at the 
time it was made and the subsequent rise in price is not a matter to be taken into consideration. 
Court’s power to award damages in certain cases 
Under Section 21 of the Specific Relief Act, the Court is empowered to award compensation in certain cases. 
Sub-section (1) states that in a suit for specific performance of a contract, the plaintiff may also claim 
compensation for its breach, either in addition to, or in substitution of such performance, Sub-section (2) 
states that if, in any suit the Court decides that specific performance ought not to be granted but that there is 
a contract between the parties which has been broken by the defendant and that the plaintiff is entitled to 
compensation for that breach, it shall award him such compensation accordingly. Sub-section 3 lays down 
that if, in any such suit the Court decides that specific performance ought to be granted, but that it is not 
sufficient to satisfy the justice of the case, and that some compensation for breach of the contract should 
also be made to the plaintiff, it shall award him such compensation accordingly. Sub-section (4) states that in 
determining the amount of any compensation awarded under this section, the Court shall be guided by the 
principles specified in Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Sub-section 5 lays down that no 
compensation shall be awarded under this Section unless the plaintiff has claimed such compensation in his 
EP-EBCL 
542 
plaint provided that where the plaintiff has not claimed any such compensation in the plaint, the Court shall at 
any stage at the proceeding, allow him to amend the plaint on such terms as may be just for including a 
claim for such compensation. Even if the contract has become incapable of specific performance that does 
not preclude the Court from exercising the jurisdiction conferred by this section. 
The conditions according to which damages may be awarded by the Court in addition to specific 
performance are: 
 
(i) the Court decides that specific performance ought to be granted but, 
 
(ii) the justice of the case requires that not only specific performance but also some compensation for 
the breach of the contract should also be given to the plaintiff. 
 
 In a suit for specific performance, the plaintiff may ask for damages in the alternative or in addition 
to specific performance of the contract. The Court’s power to award damages in a suit for specific 
performance is laid down in Section 21. 
The circumstances in which a court would award damages in lieu of specific performance: 
 
(a) Specific performance could have been granted but in the circumstances of the case the Court in its 
discretion considers that it would be better to award damages instead of specific performance. 
 
(b) Though specific performance is refused, plaintiff is entitled to compensation for breach of the 
contract. 
 
(c) If the circumstances are such that specific performance would not be granted; for example, where 
the plaintiff has disentitled himself to the specific performance, damages cannot be awarded under 
Section 21 in lieu of specific performance. 
Section 22 gives power to the Court to grant relief for possession, partitions, refund of earnest money. Under 
Section 22 any person, suing for the specific performance of a contract for the transfer of immovable 
property may, in an appropriate case ask for (a) possession or partition and separate possession, of the 
property in addition to any such performance; or (b) any other relief to which he may be entitled in case his 
claim for specific performance is refused. 
The power of the Court to grant relief under clause (b) shall be without prejudice to its power to award 
compensation under Section 21. 
Illustrations 
(a) A conveys land to B, who bequeaths it to C and dies. Thereupon D gets possession of the land and 
produces a forged instrument stating that the conveyance was made to B in trust for him. C may obtain the 
cancellation of the forged instrument. 
(b) A, representing that the tenants on his land were all at will, sells it to B, and conveys it to him by an 
instrument dated the 1st January 1877. Soon after that day, A fraudulently grants to C a lease of part of the 
land, and procures the lease dated the 1st October, 1876 to be registered under the Indian Registration Act. 
B may obtain the cancellation of this lease. 
On such cancellation, the Court may require the party to whom such relief is granted to restore as far as may 
be any benefit which he may have received from the other party and to make any compensation to him which 
justice may require. 
In a case defendant and plaintiff were real brothers residing jointly in a house. The defendant executed 
                                                                       Lesson 21        Specific Relief Act, 1963 543 
agreement to sell the property of his share in favour of plaintiff. Subsequently he sold the same property to 
another purchaser. The subsequent purchaser had no knowledge about the earlier agreement. It was held 
that he is the bona-fide purchaser of the property. The plaintiff can recover back earnest money paid by him 
to defendant (Jagtar Singh v. Gurmit Singh, AIR 2006 P&H 62). 
Section 23 lays down that even if the parties have agreed for liquidated damages, in the contract itself, 
specific performance of that contract may be decreed by the Court in proper cases but in that case the 
payment of the sum named in the contract will not be decreed. 
Section 24 imposes a bar on suit for compensation for breach of a contract after dismissal of the suit for 
specific performance. 
RECTIFICATION OF INSTRUMENTS 
Section 26 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 contains the law as to rectification of instruments. 
Rectification means correction of an error in an instrument in order to give effect to the real intention of the 
parties. Where a contract reduced into writing in pursuance of a previous agreement, fails to express the real 
intention of the parties, the court will rectify the instrument in accordance with their true intention. Here, there 
must be in existence as between the parties, a complete and perfectly unobjectionable contract; but the 
writing designed to embody it, either from fraud or mutual mistake, is incorrect or imperfect and the relief 
sought is to rectify the writing so as to bring it into confirmity with the true intention. In such a case, if such 
instrument is enforced, one party will suffer and if it is rescinded altogether both the parties will suffer but if it 
is rectified and enforced neither party will suffer. The principle on which the courts act in correcting 
instruments is that the parties are to be placed in the same position as that in which they would have stood if 
no error had been committed (Sudha Singh v. Munshi Ram, A.I.R. 1927 Cal. 605). There must have been a 
complete agreement prior to the instrument. It should be in writing and there must be clear evidence of 
mutual mistake or of fraud. 
In order to obtain rectificaion the conditions mentioned in Section 26 must be present. Thus: 
 
(i) Rectification would be granted where, though there was a consensus between the parties as to the 
contract through fraud of one of the parties, the instrument did not correctly express the real 
intention. 
 
(ii) It will also be granted, at the instance of third party, where both the parties are equally innocent, but 
owing to a common mistake, the instrument does not express their intention. 
 
(iii) Sub-section (2) makes it clear that rectification would not be allowed so as to prejudice rights 
acquired by third party in good faith and for value. 
 
 For example, A intending to sell to B his house and one of three godowns adjacent to it, executes a 
conveyance prepared by B in which through B’s fraud, all three godowns are included. Of the two 
godowns which were fraudulently included, B gives one to C and let the other to D for a rent, neither 
C nor D having any knowledge of the fraud. The conveyance may, as against B and C, be rectified 
so as to exclude from it the godown given to C, but it cannot be rectified so as to affect D’s lease. 
 
(iv) The only limitation placed on the Courts discretion is that the rectification can be done without 
prejudice to the rights acquired by third persons in good faith and for value. 
RESCISSION OF CONTRACTS 
Section 27 deals with Rescission of Contracts. “Rescission” means putting an end to a contract which is still 
operative and making it null and void ab initio. It does not apply to void contracts. Section 27 states the 
EP-EBCL 
544 
principle upon which rescission can be ordered. A person suing for rescission cannot, in the alternative sue 
for specific performance but a person suing for specific performance can sue for rescission. Sub-section (1) 
lays down that any person interested in a contract may sue to have it rescinded, and such rescission may be 
adjudged by the Court in any of the following cases, namely – (a) where the contract is voidable or 
terminable by the plaintiff; (b) where the contract is unlawful for causes not apparent on its face and the 
defendant is more to blame than the plaintiff. Sub-section (2) lays down that notwithstanding anything 
contained in Sub-section (1), the Court may refuse to rescind the contract – (a) where the plaintiff has 
expressly or impliedly ratified the contract; or (b) where, owing to the change of circumstances which has 
taken place since the making of the contract (not being due to any act of the defendant himself), the parties 
cannot be substantially restored to the position in which they stood when the contract was made; or (c) 
where third-parties have, during the subsistence of the contract, acquired rights in good faith without notice 
and for value; or (d) where only a part of the contract is sought to be rescinded and such part is not 
severable from the rest of the contract. The explanation provides that in this Section, “contract” in relation to 
the territories to which the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, does not extend, means a contract in writing. 
“This specie of specific relief is the reverse of specific performance. In one case the relief is granted by 
enforcing the performance of a contract which binds the parties, and the other by discharging him when it is 
not just to bind him” (Banerjee). So the equitable relief by way of rescission is exactly opposite of specific 
performance. Here, the contract is put to an end and is made null and void where by the contractual 
obligations also come to an end. Section 27 provides ground to the aggrieved party to rescind a contract 
without obtaining consent of the other party. 
Under clause (a) where a contract is voidable or terminable by the plaintiff, he may rescind it. The contract 
may become voidable or terminable due to fraud, undue influence, misrepresentation or coercion. 
Any person interested in a contract may sue to have it rescinded. Hence a suit may be brought by a third 
party whose interests are affected by the contract. 
In case of a rescission of a contract, the Court may, in its discretion, require the party to whom such relief is 
granted to make any compensation to the other party. The main object of this relief is to put both the parties 
in their original positions. If a plaintiff fails to get specific performance of a contract in writing, he may get it 
rescinded and delivered up to be cancelled. 
Doctrine of part performance 
The doctrine of part performance has been applied in India to the contracts of transfer of immovable property 
which though required to be registered have not been registered. The doctrine has been given statutory 
recognition in 1929 adding two new sections to Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act and Section 27A 
to the Specific Relief Act, and a proviso to Section 49 of the Indian Registration Act. 
CANCELLATION OF INSTRUMENTS 
Sub-section (1) of Section 31 provides that any person against whom a written instrument is void or voidable, 
and who has reasonable apprehension that such instrument, if left outstanding may cause him serious injury, 
may sue to have it adjudged void or voidable, and the Court may in its discretion, so adjudge it and order it to 
be delivered up and cancelled. Sub-section (2) lays down that if the instrument has been registered under 
the Indian Registration Act, 1908, the Court shall also send a copy of its decree to the officer in whose office 
the instrument has been so registered; and such officer shall note on the copy of the instrument contained in 
his books the fact of its cancellation. 
The relief of cancellation of instruments is founded upon the administration of protective justice which is 
                                                                       Lesson 21        Specific Relief Act, 1963 545 
technically known as “Quia time”. It is based upon the administration of protective justice for fear that the 
instrument may be vexatiously, or injuriously used by the defendant against the plaintiff when the evidence to 
impeach it may be lost or that it may throw a cloud of suspicion over the title or interest (Jekadula v. Bai Jini, 
39 B T R.,1072). 
Relief of cancellation under Section 31 would be available when (i) an instrument is void or voidable against 
the plaintiff; (ii) where the plaintiff may apprehend serious injury if the instrument is left outstanding and (iii) 
where it is proper under the circumstances of the case to grant the relief. 
Illustrations 
(a) A, the owner of a ship, by fraudulently representing her to be seaworthy, induces B, an underwriter, to 
insure her. B may obtain the cancellation of the policy.  
(b) A agrees to sell and deliver a ship to B, to be paid for by B’s acceptance of four bills of exchange, for 
sums amounting to Rs. 30,000, to be drawn by A on B. The bills are drawn and accepted, but the ship is not 
delivered according to the agreement. A sues B on one of the bills. B may obtain the cancellation of all the 
bills (Anglo Danubian Co. v. Rogerson (1867) L.R. 4 Eq. 3). 
Section 32 lays down that where an instrument is evidence of different rights or different obligations, the 
Court may, in proper case, cancel it in part and allow it to stand for the residue. The Court is not bound to 
cancel the whole of the instrument but may, in its discretion, when necessary, cancel it in part and allow rest 
of it to stand. 
A executes a deed of mortgage in favour of B. A gets back the deed from B by fraud and endorses on it a 
receipt for Rs. 1,200 purporting to be signed by B. B’s signature is forged. B is entitled to have the 
endorsement cancelled, leaving the deed to stand in other respects (Ram Chandar v. Ganga Saran, (1917) 
39 All. 103). 
Section 33(1) provides that on adjudging the cancellation of an instrument, the Court may require the party to 
whom such relief is granted, to restore, so far as may be, any benefit which he may have received from the 
other party and to make any compensation to him which justice may require. The provisions of this Section 
are almost similar to the provisions of Section 30 of this Act. Under both the Sections, the plaintiff must make 
such compensation to the defendant as the justice may require. 
DECLARATORY DECREES 
A declaratory decree is a decree whereby any right as to any property or the legal character of a person is 
judicially ascertained.  
The Supreme Court in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Mangilal Sharma, 1997 (7) SCALE 743, held that a 
declaratory decree merely declares the right of the decreehoder vis-a-vis the judgement debtor and does not 
in terms direct the judgement debtor to do or refrain from doing any particular act or thing. It cannot be 
executed as it only declares the rights of the decree-holder qua the judgement debtor and does not, in terms, 
direct him to do or refrain from doing any particular act or thing. 
Section 34 lays down that any person entitled to any legal character, or to any right as to any property, may 
institute a suit against any person denying, or interested to deny, his title to such character or right, and the 
Court may in its discretion make therein a declaration that he is so entitled and the plaintiff need not in such 
suit ask for any further relief provided that no Court shall make any such declaration where the plaintiff, being 
able to seek further relief than a mere declaration of title, omits to do so. The explanation provides that a 
trustee of property is a “person interested to deny” a title adverse to the title of someone who is not in 
EP-EBCL 
546 
existence, and for whom, if in existence, he would be a trustee. 
The object of declaratory decree is to remove doubt by having legal status of any rights declared by the 
Court, and to perpetuate and strengthen testimony regarding title of the plaintiff and protect it from adverse 
attacks. One of the objects of the legislature was to allow the right to enjoy the property rightfully belonging to 
the plaintiff. In case of declaratory decree, neither specific performance nor any compensation is awarded 
but only a declaration of the rights of the parties is made without any consequential relief being granted. The 
declaration does not confer any new rights upon the plaintiff but it merely declares what he had before. It 
only clears the mist that has gathered round the plaintiff’s title or status. The Court is being asked to put an 
end to the dispute and uncertainty by determining the legal character in issue. By that way the property may 
be put to better use, enjoyment and improvement. To maintain a suit under this Section following conditions 
must be fulfilled: 
 
(a) the plaintiff must be a person entitled to any legal character or to any right as to any property; 
 
(b) the defendant must be a person denying or interested to deny the plaintiff’s title to such legal 
character or, right; 
 
(c) The declaration issued for must be a declaration that the plaintiff is entitled to a legal character or to 
a right to property; and 
 
(d) where the plaintiff is able to seek further relief than a mere declaration he must seek such relief. 
Illustration 
A is properly in possession of certain lands. The inhabitants of a neighbouring village claim a right of way 
across the land. A may use for a declaration that they are not entitled to the right so claimed. 
The relief by way of declaration is purely discretionary. Instances of legal characters are — 
 
(1) Divorce on the ground of impotency 
 
(2) Legal character by marriage 
 
(3) Legitimacy or illegitimacy 
 
(4) Status of an adopted son 
 
(5) Priest of temple 
Effect of Declaration 
Section 35 lays down that a declaration is binding only on the parties to the suit, persons claiming through 
them respectively, and where any of the parties are trustees, on the persons for whom, if in existence at the 
date of the declaration, such parties would be trustees. 
Such a declaration is not judgement in rem and as such it cannot bind strangers. 
Illustration 
A, a Hindu, in a suit to which B, his alleged wife is the defendant’s seeks a declaration that his marriage was 
duly solemnised and prays for an order of restitution of conjugal rights. The Court makes the declaration and 
order of restitution of conjugal rights. C, a third-party claiming that B is his wife, sues A for the recovery of B. 
The declaration made in the former suit is not binding upon C. 
                                                                       Lesson 21        Specific Relief Act, 1963 547

Part III of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 grants specific relief called Preventive Relief i.e., preventing a party 
from doing that which he is under an obligation not to do. Preventive relief is granted at the discretion of the 
court by way of an injunction. 
An injunction is a specific order of the Court forbidding the commission of a wrong threatened or the 
continuance of a wrongful course of action already begun, or in some cases (when it is called a ‘mandatory 
injunction’) commanding active restitution of the former state of things. 
Lord Halsbury defines injunction as “a judicial process whereby a party is ordered to refrain from doing or to 
do a particular act or thing”. 
The main difference between an injunction and specific performance is that the remedy in case of an 
injunction is generally directed to prevent the violation of a negative act and therefore deals not only with 
contracts but also with torts and many other subjects of purely equitable one, whereas specific performance 
is directed to compelling performance of an active duty. 
It is known as a “judicial process by which one, who has invaded or is threatening to invade the rights (legal 
or equitable) of another is restrained from continuing or commencing such wrongful act. Injunction is the 
most ordinary form of preventive relief. For the effective administration of justice, this power to prevent and to 
restrain is absolutely necessary. 
Characteristics of an injunction 
An injunction has three characteristic features; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If the wrongful act has already taken place, the injunction prevents its repetition. If it is merely threatened, the 
threat is prevented from being executed. 
Temporary and perpetual injunctions 
Section 36 states that preventive relief is granted at the discretion of the Court by injunction, temporary or 
perpetual. 
The temporary injunctions are granted under Order 39 Rules 1-2 of the Civil Procedure Code while perpetual 
injunctions are dealt within Section 38 of the Specific Relief Act. 
The temporary injunction may be dissolved at any time under Civil Procedure Code by the defendant 
EP-EBCL 
548 
showing specific cause to the satisfaction of the Court against the order granting the injunction, or it 
automatically terminate with the disposal of the suit. The general principles governing temporary and 
permanent injunctions are mainly the same except that a temporary injunction is granted before the plaintiff 
establishes his case at the trial. 
Sub-section (1) of Section 37 lays down that temporary injunctions are such as are to continue until a 
specified time, or until the further order of the Court and they may be granted at any stage of a suit, and are 
regulated by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. 
Sub-section (2) states that a perpetual injunction can only be granted by the decree made at the hearing and 
upon the merits of the suit; the defendant is thereby perpetually enjoined from the assertion of right, or from 
the commission of an act, which would be contrary to the rights of the Plaintiff. It may be pointed out that: 
 
(i) While Section 37(1) of the Act gives the meaning of a perpetual injunction, Sections 37 to 62 lay 
down the principles according to which the perpetual injunction would be granted. 
 
(ii) The cases in which the perpetual injunction may be granted are of two classes. The object is to 
prevent the breach of an obligation existing in favour of the applicant, but such obligation may either 
arise out of a contract or otherwise. In case of contractual agreement principles governing specific 
performance will apply and in other cases, the injunction would be granted if the plaintiff can show 
that the defendant has a legal duty or obligation towards him and that by the non-performance of 
such duty the right to enjoyment of property has been materially affected. Such cases are where the 
defendant is trustee of the property of the plaintiff or where the injunction is necessary to prevent 
multiplicity of judicial proceedings, etc. 
Section 38 deals with granting of perpetual injunction. Sub-section (1) states that subject to the other 
provisions contained in or referred to by this chapter, a perpetual injunction may be granted to the plaintiff to 
prevent the breach of an obligation existing in his favour whether express or by implication. 
Sub-section (2) provides that when any such obligation arises from contract, the Court shall be guided by the 
rules and provisions contained in Chapter II, i.e., the chapter on specific performance of contracts. Sub-
section (3) lays down that when the defendant invades or threatens to invade the plaintiff’s right to, or 
enjoyment of property, the Court may grant a perpetual injunction in the following cases, namely: (a) where 
the defendant is a trustee of the property for the plaintiff; (b) where there exists no standard for ascertaining 
the actual damage caused, or likely to be caused by the invasion; (c) where the invasion is such that 
compensation in money would not afford adequate relief; (d) where the injunction is necessary to prevent a 
multiplicity of judicial proceedings. 
Difference between the remedies of specific performance and injunction  
Specific performance is decreed to compel the performance of an active duty, while injunction is decreed to 
prevent the violation of a negative duty. Normally, the former deals with contracts, while the latter with torts and 
other subjects of equitable nature. If a contract is positive in its nature, it calls for the relief of specific 
performance, on the other hand, if it is negative in its nature, it calls for relief of injunction. 
The principle governing the award of injunction as a mode of enforcement of contracts is similar to that of 
specific performance. This is clearly borne out by Section (38)2 of the Act. Thus, the enforcement of a 
contract is governed by both specific relief and injunction. “The jurisdiction of equity to grant such injunction 
is substantially coexistent with its jurisdiction to compel a specific performance”. But still their fields of 
operation are separate from each other. While a promise to do is enforced by specific performance, a 
promise to forbear is enforced by injunction. Section 41(e) further provides that contract which will not be 
                                                                       Lesson 21        Specific Relief Act, 1963 549 
affirmatively enforced by a decree of specific performance, will not be negatively enforced by issuing an 
injunction. The only exception to this rule is found in Section 42. 
Mandatory injunction 
Section 39 dealing with mandatory injunctions states that when to prevent the breach of an obligation, it is 
necessary to compel the performance of certain acts which the Court is capable of enforcing, the Court may 
in its discretion grant an injunction to prevent the breach complained of, and also to compel performance of 
the requisite acts. For example, A builds a house with eaves projecting over B’s land, B may sue for an 
injunction to pull down so much of the eaves as so projecting over his land. 
According to Section 40, the plaintiff in a suit for perpetual injunction under Section 38 or mandatory 
injunction under Section 39, may claim damages either in addition to, or in substitution for such injunction 
and the Court, may, if it thinks fit, award such damages. 
Injunction when refused 
Section 41 gives a list of cases in which a perpetual injunction cannot be granted. It says that an injunction 
cannot be granted —  
 
(a) to restrain any person from prosecuting a judicial proceeding pending at the institution of the suit in 
which the injunction is sought, unless such restraint is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of 
proceedings; 
 
(b) to restrain any person from instituting or prosecuting any proceeding in a Court not subordinate to 
that from which the injunction is sought; 
 
(c) to restrain any person from applying to any legislative body; 
 
(d) to restrain any person from instituting or prosecuting any proceeding in a criminal matter; 
 
(e) to prevent the breach of a contract the performance of which would not be specifically enforced; 
 
(f) to prevent on the ground of nuisance, an act of which it is not reasonably clear that it will be 
nuisance; 
 
(g) to prevent a continuing breach in which the plaintiff has acquiesced; 
 
(h) when equally efficacious relief can certainly be obtained by any other usual mode of proceeding 
except in case of breach of trust; 
 
(i) when the conduct of the plaintiff or his agents has been such as to disentitle him to the assistance 
of the Court; 
 
(j) when the plaintiff has no interest in the matter. 
It may be noted that this relief also is a discretionary remedy. It may be refused even if the case is not 
covered by Section 41. 
Injunction to perform negative agreement 
Section 42 provides that notwithstanding anything contained in clause (e) of Section 41, where a contract 
comprises an affirmative agreement to do a certain act, coupled with negative agreement, express or 
implied, not to do a certain act, the circumstance that the Court is unable to compel specific performance of 
the affirmative agreement shall not preclude it from granting an injunction to perform the negative agreement, 
EP-EBCL 
550 
provided that the plaintiff has not failed to perform the contract so far as it is binding on him. 
This Section is based upon an English case viz., Lumley v. Wagner (21) L.J. CH. 898. In this case Miss W, a 
singer agreed to sing at L’s theatre for a certain period and not to sing anywhere else during that period. 
Afterwards, she entered into a contract to sing at another theatre and refused to perform her contract with L. 
The Court refused to enforce her positive agreement to sing at L’s theatre (by specific performance) but 
granted an injunction restraining her from singing at any other theatre thereby preventing breach of the 
negative part of the agreement though the positive part of it, being a contract for the personal service, could 
not be specifically enforced. 
Conditions necessary for the applicability of this Section are: 
 
(1) The contract should comprise of two agreements, one affirmative and another negative. 
 
(2) Both the agreements must be divisible. 
 
(3) The negative agreement must relate to a specific act. 
 
(4) The Court should be unable to compel specific performance of the affirmative agreement. 
 
(5) The plaintiff must not have failed to perform the contract, so far as it is binding upon him. 
A negative stipulation may be express or implied. An express negative stipulation in one where the negative 
stipulation is put expressly. The Section does not say that every affirmative contract includes by necessary 
implication a negative agreement to refrain from doing certain things. It is therefore a question of 
interpretation in each case to find whether a particular contract can be said to have a negative stipulation, 
express or implied, contained in it, e.g., the mere use of word “exclusively” does not imply a negative 
stipulation to refrain from service of other people. 
The provisions of this Section are based on the equitable principle that “he who seeks equity must do equity”. 
The principle as laid down in Section 42 was followed in the cases of Burn Mcdonald (1907) 36 Cal 354; 
Metropolitan Electric Supply v. Ginder, (1901) 2 Ch. 799; Subba Naidu v. Hari Badshah, (13 M.L.J. 13); and 
Madras Rly Co. v. Rust, (1891) 14 Mad 18. 
LESSON ROUND-UP 
• Under the Specific Relief Act, 1963 only a party to the contract can get its specific performance. The 
section gives the list of persons who can sue for specific performance of a contract. The general principle is 
that in a suit for specific performance of a contract, all the parties to the contract should be parties to the 
suit and no one else. 
• The contracts which cannot be specifically enforced are a contract for the non-performance of which 
compensation in money is an adequate relief; a contract which runs into such minute and numerous details 
that the Court cannot enforce specific performance of its material terms or which is dependant upon the 
personal qualification or volition of the parties or a contract from its nature is such that the Court cannot 
enforce specific performance. 
• The contracts which cannot be specifically enforced are a contract which is in its nature determinable; a 
contract, the performance of which involves the performance of a continuous duty which the court cannot 
supervise. 
• The very foundation of specific performance of a contract is that an award for damages does not afford the 
aggrieved party a complete remedy. If in the opinion of the Court damages will be an adequate remedy, 
specific performance of the contract cannot be decreed. 
                                                                       Lesson 21        Specific Relief Act, 1963 551 
• An injunction cannot be granted under Specific Relief Act to restrain any person from prosecuting a judicial 
proceeding pending at the institution of the suit in which the injunction is sought, unless such restraint is 
necessary to prevent a multiplicity of proceedings; to restrain any person from instituting or prosecuting any 
proceeding in a Court not subordinate to that from which the injunction is sought.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Sale of Goods Act is one of very old mercantile law. 
Sale of Goods is one of the special types  of  
contract.  Initially, this was  part  of  Indian Contract 
Act  itself.  Later, this was deleted  in  Contract Act, 
and separate Sale of Goods Act was passed in 
1930. 
Sale of Goods Act is complimentary to Contract Act. 
Basic provisions of Contract Act apply to contract of 
Sale of Goods Act also.  Basic requirements of 
contract i.e. 
 
Offer 
and 
acceptance, 
legally 
enforceable agreement, mutual consent, parties 
competent to contract; free consent, lawful object, 
consideration etc. apply to contract of Sale of Goods 
Act also. 
This lesson is to be taught after the students have  
been  made  familiar  with  the  general principles of 
contract in which the emphasis is on  understanding  
and  appreciating  the  basic essentials  of  a  valid  
contract  and  on  the existence of contractual 
relationship in various instances.  In  today’s  era,  
the  need  for awareness  of  buyers  and  sellers  
rights  is  of utmost importance. In the backdrop of 
this and Contract Act, Sales of Goods Act is taught 
here to let the buyers beware and sellers to comply 
the requisite law in better and spirit. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Every sale has five basic obstacles: no need, no money, no hurry, no desire, no trust.

LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL 
554 
The law relating to sale of goods is contained in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. It has to be read as part of the 
Indian Contract Act, 1872 [Sections 2(5) and (3)]. 
Contract of Sale of Goods 
According to Section 4, a contract of sale of goods is a contract whereby the seller: 
 
(i) transfers or agrees to transfer the property in goods, 
 
(ii) to the buyer, 
 
(iii) for a money consideration called the price. 
It shows that the expression “contract of sale” includes both a sale where the seller transfers the ownership 
of the goods to the buyer, and an agreement to sell where the ownership of goods is to be transferred at a 
future time or subject to some conditions to be fulfilled later on. 
The following are thus the essentials of a contract of sale of goods: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(i) Bilateral contract: It is a bilateral contract because the property in goods has to pass from one party 
to another. A person cannot buy the goods himself. 
 
(ii) Transfer of property: The object of a contract of sale must be the transfer of property (meaning 
ownership) in goods from one person to another. 
 
(iii) Goods: The subject matter must be some goods. 
 
(iv) Price or money consideration: The goods must be sold for some price, where the goods are 
exchanged for goods it is barter, not sale. 
 
(v) All essential elements of a valid contract must be present in a contract of sale. 
Distinction between Sale and Agreement to Sell 
The following points will bring out the distinction between sale and an agreement to sell: 
 
(a) In a sale, the property in the goods sold passes to the buyer at the time of contract so that he 
                                                                       Lesson 22        Sale of Goods Act, 1930 
555 
becomes the owner of the goods. In an agreement to sell, the ownership does not pass to the buyer 
at the time of the contract, but it passes only when it becomes sale on the expiry of certain time or 
the fulfilment of some conditions subject to which the property in the goods is to be transferred. 
 
(b) An agreement to sell is an executory contract, a sale is an executed contract. 
 
(c) An agreement to sell is a contract pure and simple, but a sale is contract plus conveyance. 
 
(d) If there is an agreement to sell and the goods are destroyed by accident, the loss falls on the seller. 
In a sale, the loss falls on the buyer, even though the goods are with the seller. 
 
(e) If there is an agreement to sell and the seller commits a breach, the buyer has only a personal 
remedy against the seller, namely, a claim for damages. But if there has been a sale, and the seller 
commits a breach by refusing to deliver the goods, the buyer has not only a personal remedy 
against him but also the other remedies which an owner has in respect of goods themselves such 
as a suit for conversion or detenue, etc. 
Sale and Bailment 
A “bailment” is a transaction under which goods are delivered by one person (the bailor) to another (the 
bailee) for some purpose, upon a contract that they be returned or disposed of as directed after the purpose 
is accomplished (Section 148 of the Indian Contact Act, 1872). 
The property in the goods is not intended to and does not pass on delivery though it may sometimes be the 
intention of the parties that it should pass in due course. But where goods are delivered to another on terms 
which indicate that the property is to pass at once the contract must be one of sale and not bailment. 
Sale and Contract for Work and Labour 
The distinction between a “sale” and a “contract for work and labour” becomes important when question of 
passing of property arises for consideration. 
However, these two are difficult to distinguish. The test generally applied is that if as a result of the contract, 
property in an article is transferred to one who had no property therein previously for a money consideration, 
it is a sale, where it is otherwise it is a contract for work and labour. 
Sale and Hire Purchase Agreement 
“Sale”, is a contract by which property in goods passes from the seller to the buyer for a price. 
A “hire purchase agreement” is basically a contract of hire, but in addition, it gives the hirer an option to 
purchase the goods at the end of the hiring period. Consequently, until the final payment, the hirer is merely 
a bailee of goods and ownership remains vested in the bailor. Under such a contract, the owner of goods 
delivers the goods to person who agrees to pay certain stipulated periodical payments as hire charges. 
Though the possession is with the hirer, the ownership of the goods remains with the original owner. 
The essence of hire purchase agreement is that there is no agreement to buy, but only an option is given to 
the hirer to buy by paying all the instalments or put an end to the hiring and return the goods to the owner, at 
any time before the exercise of the option. 
Since the hirer does not become owner of the goods until he has exercised his option to buy, he cannot pass 
any title even to an innocent and bona fide purchaser. The transaction of hire-purchase protects the owner of 
the goods against the insolvency of the buyer, for if the buyer becomes insolvent or fails to pay the 
instalments, he can take back the goods as owner. And if the hirer declines to take delivery of the goods, the 
remedy of the owner will be damages for non-hiring and not for rent for the period agreed. 
EP-EBCL 
556 
It is important to note the difference between a hire purchase agreement and mere payment of the price by 
instalments because, the latter is a sale, only the payment of price is to be made by instalments. 
The distinction between the two is very important because, in a hire-purchase agreement the risk of loss or 
deterioration of the goods hired lies with the owner and the hirer will be absolved of any responsibility 
therefor, if he has taken reasonable care to protect the same as a bailee. But it is otherwise in the case of a 
sale where the price is to be paid in instalments. 
Subject matter of Contract of Sale of Goods 
 
Goods 
The subject matter of the contract of sale is essentially goods. According to Section 2(7) of the Sale of 
Goods Act, “goods” means every kind of movable property other than actionable claims and money and 
includes stock and shares, growing crops, grass and things attached to or forming part of the land which are 
agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract of sale. 
Actionable claims and money are not goods and cannot be brought and sold under this Act. Money means 
current money, i.e., the recognised currency in circulation in the country, but not old and rare coins which 
may be treated as goods. An actionable claim is what a person cannot make a present use of or enjoy, but 
what can be recovered by him by means of a suit or an action. Thus, a debt due to a man from another is an 
actionable claim and cannot be sold as goods, although it can be assigned. Under the provisions of the 
Transfer of Property Act, 1882, goodwill, trade marks, copyrights, patents are all goods, so is a ship. As 
regards water, gas, electricity, it is doubtful whether they are goods (Rash Behari v. Emperor, (1936) 41 
C.W.N. 225; M.B. Electric Supply Co. Ltd. v. State of Rajasthan, AIR (1973) Raj. 132). 
Goods may be (a) existing, (b) future, or (c) contingent. The existing goods may be (i) specific or generic, (ii) 
ascertained or unascertained. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Existing Goods 
Existing goods are goods which are either owned or possessed by the seller at the time of the contract. Sale 
of goods possessed but not owned by the seller would be by an agent or pledgee. 
                                                                       Lesson 22        Sale of Goods Act, 1930 
557 
Existing goods are specific goods which are identified and agreed upon at the time of the contract of sale. 
Ascertained goods are either specific goods at the time of the contract or are ascertained or identified to the 
contract later on i.e. made specific. 
Generic or unascertained goods are goods which are not specifically identified but are indicated by 
description. If a merchant agrees to supply a radio set from his stock of radio sets, it is a contract of sale of 
unascertained goods because it is not known which set will be delivered. As soon as a particular set is 
separated or identified for delivery and the buyer has notice of it, the goods are ascertained and become 
specific goods. 
Future Goods 
Future goods are goods to be manufactured or produced or acquired by the seller after the making of the 
contract of sale. A agrees to sell all the mangoes which will be produced in his garden next season. This is 
an agreement for the sale of future goods. [Section 2(6)] 
Contingent Goods 
Where there is a contract for the sale of goods, the acquisition of which by the seller depends upon a 
contingency which may or may not happen—such goods are known as contingent goods. Contingent goods 
fall in the class of future goods. A agrees to sell a certain TV set provided he is able to get it from its present 
owner. This is an agreement to sell contingent goods. In such a case, if the contingency does not happen for 
no fault of the seller, he will not be liable for damages. 
Actual sale can take place only of specific goods and property in goods passes from the seller to buyer at the 
time of the contract, provided the goods are in a deliverable state and the contract is unconditional. 
There can be an agreement to sell only in respect of future or contingent goods. 
Effect of Perishing of Goods 
In a contract of sale of goods, the goods may perish before sale is complete. Such a stage may arise in the 
following cases: 
(i) Goods perishing before making a contract  
Where in a contract of sale of specific goods, the goods without the knowledge of the seller have, at the time 
of making the contract perished or become so damaged as no longer to answer to their description in the 
contract, the contract is void. This is based on the rule that mutual mistake of fact essential to the contract 
renders the contract void. (Section 7) 
If the seller was aware of the destruction and still entered into the contract, he is estopped from disputing the 
contract. Moreover, perishing of goods not only includes loss by theft but also where the goods have lost 
their commercial value. 
(ii) Goods perishing after agreement to sell  
Where there is an agreement to sell specific goods, and subsequently the goods without any fault of any 
party perish or are so damaged as no longer to answer to their description in the agreement before the risk 
passes to the buyer, the agreement is thereby avoided. The provision applies only to sale of specific goods. 
If the sale is of unascertained goods, the perishing of the whole quantity of such goods in the possession of 
the seller will not relieve him of his obligation to deliver. (Section 8) 
Price 
No sale can take place without a price. Thus, if there is no valuable consideration to support a voluntary 
EP-EBCL 
558 
surrender of goods by the real owner to another person, the transaction is a gift, and is not governed by the 
Sale of Goods Act. Therefore, price, which is money consideration for the sale of goods, constitutes the 
essence for a contract of sale. It may be money actually paid or promised to be paid. If a consideration other 
than money is to be given, it is not a sale. 
Modes of Fixing Price (Sections 9 and 10) 
The price may be fixed: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Where the contract states that the price is to be fixed by a third-party and such third-party fails to do so, the 
contract is void. But if the buyer has already taken the benefit of the goods, he must pay a reasonable price 
for them. If the third-party’s failure to fix the price is due to the fault of the seller or buyer, then that party is 
liable for an action for damages. 
Where nothing is said by the parties regarding price, the buyer must pay a reasonable price. What is a 
reasonable price is a question of fact dependent upon the circumstances of each particular case. Generally, 
the market price would be a reasonable price. 
Conditions and Warranties (Sections 12-17) 
The parties are at liberty to enter into a contract with any terms they please. As a rule, before a contract of 
sale is concluded, certain statements are made by the parties to each other. The statement may amount to a 
stipulation, forming part of the contract or a mere expression of opinion which is not part of the contract. If it 
is a statement by the seller on the reliance of which the buyer makes the contract, it will amount to a 
stipulation. If it is a mere commendation by the seller of his goods it does not amount to a stipulation and 
does not give the right of action. 
The stipulation may either be a condition or a warranty. Section 12 draws a clear distinction between a 
condition and a warranty. Whether a stipulation is a condition or only a warranty is a matter of substance rather 
than the form of the words used. A stipulation may be a condition though called a warranty and vice versa. 
                                                                       Lesson 22        Sale of Goods Act, 1930 
559 
Conditions 
If the stipulation forms the very basis of the contract or is essential to the main purpose of the contract, it is a 
condition. The breach of the condition gives the aggrieved party a right to treat the contract as repudiated. 
Thus, if the seller fails to fulfil a condition, the buyer may treat the contract as repudiated, refuse the goods 
and, if he has already paid for them, recover the price. He can also claim damages for the breach of contract. 
Warranties 
If the stipulation is collateral to the main purpose of the contract, i.e., is a subsidiary promise, it is a warranty. 
The effect of a breach of a warranty is that the aggrieved party cannot repudiate the contract but can only 
claim damages. Thus, if the seller does not fulfil a warranty, the buyer must accept the goods and claim 
damages for breach of warranty. 
Section 11 states that the stipulation as to time of payment are not to be deemed conditions (and hence not 
to be of the essence of a contract of sale) unless such an intention appears from the contract. Whether any 
other stipulation as to time (e.g., time of delivery) is of the essence of the contract or not depends on the 
terms of the contract. 
When condition sinks to the level of warranty 
In some cases a condition sinks or descends to the level of a warranty. The first two cases depend upon the 
will of the buyer, but the third is compulsory and acts as estoppel against him. 
 
(a) A condition will become a warranty where the buyer waives the condition; or 
 
(b) A condition will sink to the level of a warranty where the buyer treats the breach of condition as a 
breach of warranty; or 
 
(c) Where the contract is indivisible and the buyer has accepted the goods or part thereof, the breach 
of condition can only be treated as breach of warranty. The buyer can only claim damages and 
cannot reject the goods or treat the contract as repudiated. 
Sometimes the seller may be excused by law from fulfilling any condition or warranty and the buyer will not 
then have a remedy in damages. 
Implied Warranties/Conditions 
Even where no definite representations have been made, the law implies certain representations as having 
been made which may be warranties or conditions. An express warranty or condition does not negative an 
implied warranty or condition unless inconsistent therewith. 
There are two implied warranties: 
Implied Warranties [Section 14(b), 14(c) and 16(3)] 
 
(a) Implied warranty of quiet possession: If the circumstances of the contract are such as there is an 
implied warranty that the buyer shall have and enjoy quiet possession of the goods. 
 
(b) Implied warranty against encumbrances: There is a further warranty that the goods are not subject 
to any right in favour of a third-party, or the buyer’s possession shall not be disturbed by reason of 
the existence of encumbrances. This means that if the buyer is required to, and does discharge the 
amount of the encumbrance, there is breach of warranty, and he is entitled to claim damages from 
the seller. 
EP-EBCL

Implied Conditions [Sections 14(a), 15(1), (2), 16(1) and Proviso 16(2), and Proviso 16(3) and 
12(b) and 12(c)]. 
Different implied conditions apply under different types of contracts of sale of goods, such as sale by 
description, or sale by sample, or sale by description as well as sample. The condition, as to title to goods 
applies to all types of contracts, subject to that there is apparently no other intention. 
Implied Conditions as to title 
There is an implied condition that the seller, in an actual sale, has the right to sell the goods, and, in an 
agreement to sell, he will have a right to sell the goods at the time when property is to pass. As a result, if the 
title of the seller turns out to be defective, the buyer is entitled to reject the goods and can recover the full price 
paid by him. 
In Rowland v. Divall (1923) 2 K.B. 500, ‘A’ had bought a second hand motor car from ‘B’ and paid for it. After 
he had used it for six months, he was deprived of it because the seller had no title to it. It was held that ‘B’ 
had broken the condition as to title and ‘A’ was therefore, entitled to recover the purchase money from ‘B’ 
Implied conditions under a sale by description 
In a sale by description there are the following implied conditions: 
(a) Goods must correspond with description: It is provided under Section 15 of the Act that when there is 
a sale of goods by description, there is an implied condition that the goods shall correspond with description. 
In a sale by description, the buyer relies for his information on the description of the goods given by the 
seller, e.g. in the contract or in the preliminary negotiations. 
Where ‘A’ buys goods which he has not seen, it must be sale by description, e.g., where he buys a ‘new Fiat 
car’ from ‘B’ and the car is not new, he can reject the car. 
Even if the buyer has seen the goods, the goods must be in accordance with the description (Beale v. Taylor 
(1967) All E.R. 253). 
(b) Goods must also be of merchantable quality: If they are bought by description from dealer of goods of 
that description. [Section 16(2)] 
Merchantable quality means that the goods must be such as would be acceptable to a reasonable person, 
having regard to prevailing conditions. They are not merchantable if they have defects which make them unfit 
for ordinary use, or are such that a reasonable person knowing of their condition would not buy them. ‘P’ 
bought black yarn from ‘D’ and, when delivered, found it damaged by the white ants. The condition of 
merchantability was broken. 
But, if the buyer has examined the goods, there is no implied condition as regards defects which such 
examination ought to have revealed. If, however, examination by the buyer does not reveal the defect and he 
approves and accepts the goods, but when put to work, the goods are found to be defective, there is a 
breach of condition of merchantable quality. 
The buyer is given a right to examine the goods before accepting them. But a mere opportunity without an 
actual examination, however, cursory, would not suffice to deprive him of this right. 
(c) Condition as to wholesomeness: The provisions, (i.e., eatables) supplied must not only answer the 
description, but they must also be merchantable and wholesome or sound. ‘F’ bought milk from ‘A’ and the milk 
contained typhoid germs. ‘F’s wife became infected and died. ‘A’ was liable for damages. Again, ‘C’ bought a 
                                                                       Lesson 22        Sale of Goods Act, 1930 
561 
bun at ‘M’s bakery, and broke one of his teeth by biting on a stone present in the bun. ‘M’ was held liable. 
(d) Condition as to quality or fitness for a particular purpose: Ordinarily, in a contract of sale, there is no 
implied warranty or condition as to the quality or fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied. 
But there is an implied condition that the goods are reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are required 
if: 
 
(i) the buyer expressly or by implication makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the 
goods are required, so as to show that he relies on the seller’s skill and judgement, and 
 
(ii) the goods are of a description which it is in the course of the seller’s business to supply (whether he 
is the manufacturer or producer or not). There is no such condition if the goods are bought under a 
patent or trade name. 
In Priest v. Last (1903) 2 K.B. 148, a hot water bottle was bought by the plaintiff, a draper, who could not be 
expected to have special skill knowledge with regard to hot water bottles, from a chemist, who sold such 
articles stating that the bottle will not stand boiling water but was intended to hold hot water. While being 
used by the plaintiff’s wife, the bottle bursted and injured her. Held, the seller was responsible for damages 
as the bottle was not fit for use as a hot water bottle. 
In Grant v. Australian Knitting Mills (1936) 70 MLJ 513, ‘G’ a doctor purchased woollen underpants from ‘M’ a 
retailer whose business was to sell goods of that description. After wearing the underpants, ‘G’ developed 
some skin diseases. Held, the goods were not fit for their only use and ‘G’ was entitled to avoid the contract 
and claim damages. 
Implied conditions under a sale by sample (Section 17) 
In a contract of sale by sample: 
 
(a) there is an implied condition that the bulk shall correspond with the sample in quality; 
 
(b) there is another implied condition that the buyer shall have a reasonable opportunity of comparing 
the bulk with the sample; 
 
(c) it is further an implied condition of merchantability, as regards latent or hidden defects in the goods 
which would not be apparent on reasonable examination of the sample. “Worsted coating” quality 
equal to sample was sold to tailors, the cloth was found to have a defect in the fixture rendering the 
same unfit for stitching into coats. The seller was held liable even though the same defect existed in 
the sample, which was examined. 
Implied conditions in sale by sample as well as by description 
In a sale by sample as well as by description, the goods supplied must correspond both with the samples as 
well as with the description. Thus, in Nichol v. Godts (1854) 158 E.R. 426, there was a sale of “foreign 
refined rape-oil having warranty only equal to sample”. The oil tendered was the same as the sample, but it 
was not “foreign refined rape-oil” having a mixture of it and other oil. It was held that the seller was liable, and 
the buyer could refuse to accept. 
IMPLIED WARRANTIES 
Implied warranties are those which the law presumes to have been incorporated in the contract of sale 
inspite of the fact that the parties have not expressly included them in a contract of sale. Subject to the 
EP-EBCL 
562 
contract to the contrary, following are the implied warranties in a contract of sale: 
 
(i) Warranty as to quiet possession: Section 14(b) of the Sale of Goods Act provides that there is an 
implied warranty that the buyer shall have and enjoy quiet possession of goods. If the buyer’s 
possession is disturbed by anyone having superior title than that of the seller, the buyer is entitled to 
hold the seller liable for breach of warranty. 
 
(ii) Warranty as to freedom from encumbrances: Section 14(c) states that in a contract of sale, there is 
an implied warranty that the goods shall be free from any charge or encumbrance in favour of any 
third party not declared or known to the buyer before or at the time when the contract is made. But if 
the buyer is aware of any encumbrance on the goods at the time of entering into the contract, he will 
not be entitled to any compensation from the seller for discharging the encumbrance. 
 
(iii) Warranty to disclose dangerous nature of goods: If the goods are inherently dangerous or likely to 
be dangerous and the buyer is ignorant of the danger, the seller must warn the buyer of the 
probable danger. 
 
(iv) Warranties implied by the custom or usage of trade: Section 16(3) provides that an implied warranty 
or condition as to quality or fitness for a particular purpose may be annexed by the usage of trade. 
Doctrine of Caveat Emptor 
The term “caveat emptor” is a Latin word which means “let the buyer beware”. This principle states that it is 
for the buyer to satisfy himself that the goods which he is purchasing are of the quality which he requires. If 
he buys goods for a particular purpose, he must satisfy himself that they are fit for that purpose. The doctrine 
of caveat emptor is embodied in Section 16 of the Act which states that “subject to the provisions of this Act 
and of any other law for the time being in force, there is no implied warranty or condition as to the quality or 
fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied under a contract of sale”. In simple words, it is not the 
seller’s duty to give to the buyer the goods which are fit for a suitable purpose of the buyer. If he makes a 
wrong selection, he cannot blame the seller if the goods turn out to be defective or do not serve his purpose. 
The principle was applied in the case of Ward v. Hobbs, (1878) 4 A.C. 13, where certain pigs were sold by 
auction and no warranty was given by seller in respect of any fault or error of description. The buyer paid the 
price for healthy pigs. But they were ill and all but one died of typhoid fever. They also infected some of the 
buyer’s own pigs. It was held that there was no implied condition or warranty that the pigs were of good 
health. It was the buyer’s duty to satisfy himself regarding the health of the pigs. 
Exceptions: Section 16 lays down the following exceptions to the doctrine of Caveat Emptor: 
 
(1) Where the seller makes a false representation and the buyer relies on it. 
 
(2) When the seller actively conceals a defect in the goods which is not visible on a reasonable 
examination of the same. 
 
(3) When the buyer, relying upon the skill and judgement of the seller, has expressly or impliedly 
communicated to him the purpose for which the goods are required. 
 
(4) Where goods are bought by description from a seller who deals in goods of that description. 
Passing of Property or Transfer of Ownership (Sections 18-20) 
The sole purpose of a sale is the transfer of ownership of goods from the seller to the buyer. It is important to 
know the precise moment of time at which the property in the goods passes from the seller to the buyer for 
the following reasons: 
 
(a) The general rule is that risk follows the ownership, whether the delivery has been made or not. If the 
                                                                       Lesson 22        Sale of Goods Act, 1930 
563 
goods are lost or damaged by accident or otherwise, then, subject to certain exceptions, the loss 
falls on the owner of the goods at the time they are lost or damaged. 
 
(b) When there is a danger of the goods being damaged by the action of third parties, it is generally the 
owner who can take action. 
 
(c) The rights of third parties may depend upon the passing of the property if the buyer resells the 
goods to a third-party, the third-party will only obtain a good title if the property in the goods has 
passed to the buyer before or at the time of the resale. Similarly, if the seller, in breach of his 
contract with the buyer, attempts to sell the goods to a third party in the goods, has not passed to 
the buyer, e.g., where there is only an agreement to sell. 
 
(d) In case of insolvency of either the seller or the buyer, it is necessary to know whether the goods can 
be taken over by the official assignee or the official receiver. It will depend upon whether the 
property in the goods was with the party adjudged insolvent. 
Thus in this context, ownership and possession are two distinct concepts and these two can at times remain 
separately with two different persons. 
Passing of property in specific goods 
In a sale of specific or ascertained goods, the property in them passes to the buyer as and when the parties 
intended to pass. The intention must be gathered from the terms of the contract, the conduct of the parties and 
the circumstances of the case. 
Unless a contrary intention appears, the following rules are applicable for ascertaining the intention of the 
parties: 
 
(a) Where there is an unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state, the 
property in the goods passes to the buyer when the contract is made. Deliverable state means such 
a state that the buyer would be bound to take delivery of the goods. The fact that the time of 
delivery or the time of payment is postponed does not prevent the property from passing at once. 
(Section 20) 
 
(b) Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods not in a deliverable state, i.e., the seller has 
to do something to the goods to put them in a deliverable state, the property does not pass until that 
thing is done and the buyer has notice of it. (Section 21) 
 
 A certain quantity of oil was brought. The oil was to be filled into casks by the seller and then taken 
away by the buyer. Some casks were filled in the presence of buyer but, before the remainder could 
be filled, a fire broke out and the entire quantity of oil was destroyed, Held, the buyer must bear the 
loss of the oil which was put into the casks (i.e., put in deliverable state) and the seller must bear 
the loss of the remainder (Rugg v. Minett (1809) 11 East 210). 
 
(c) Where there is a sale of specific goods in a deliverable state, but the seller is bound to weigh, 
measure, test or do something with reference to the goods for the purpose of ascertaining the price, 
the property to the goods for the purpose of ascertaining the price, does not pass until such act or 
thing is done and the buyer has notice of it. (Section 22) 
 
(d) When goods are delivered to the buyer “on approval” or “on sale of return” or other similar terms the 
property therein passes to the buyer: 
 
(i) when he signifies his approval or acceptance to the seller, or does any other act adopting the 
transaction; 
EP-EBCL 
564 
 
(ii) if he does not signify his approval or acceptance but retains the goods without giving notice of 
rejection, in such a case—(a) if a time has been fixed for the return of the goods, on the 
expiration of such time; and (b) if no time has been fixed, on the expiration of a reasonable time. 
Ownership in unascertained goods 
The property in unascertained or future goods does not pass until the goods are ascertained. 
Unascertained goods are goods defined by description only, for example, 100 quintals of wheat; and not 
goods identified and agreed upon when the contract is made. 
Unless a different intention appears, the following rules are applicable for ascertaining the intention of the 
parties in regard to passing of property in respect of such goods: 
 
(a) The property in unascertained or future goods sold by description passes to the buyer when goods 
of that description and in a deliverable state are unconditionally appropriated to the contract, either 
by the seller with the assent of the buyer or by the buyer with the assent of the seller. Such assent 
may be expressed or implied and may be given either before or after the appropriation is made. 
(Section 23) 
 
(b) If there is a sale of a quantity of goods out of a large quantity, for example, 50 quintals of rice out of 
a heap in B’s godown, the property will pass on the appropriation of the specified quantity by one 
party with the assent of the other. 
 
(c) Delivery by the seller of the goods to a carrier or other buyer for the purpose of transmission to the 
buyer in pursuance of the contact is an appropriation sufficient to pass the property in the goods. 
 
(d) The property in goods, whether specific or unascertained, does not pass if the seller reserves the 
right of disposal of the goods. Apart from an express reservation of the right of disposal, the seller is 
deemed to reserve the right of disposal in the following two cases: 
 
(i) where goods are shipped or delivered to a railway administration for carriage by railway and by 
the bill of lading or railway receipt, the goods are deliverable to the order of the seller or his 
agent. 
 
(ii) when the seller sends the bill of exchange for the price of the goods to the buyer for this acceptance, 
together with the bill of lading, the property in the goods does not pass to the buyer unless he 
accepts the bill of exchange. 
Passing of Risk (Section 26) 
The general rule is that goods remain at the seller’s risk until the ownership is transferred to the buyer. After 
the ownership has passed to the buyer, the goods are at the buyer’s risk whether the delivery has been 
made or not. For example, ‘A’ buys goods of ‘B’ and property has passed from ‘B’ to ‘A’; but the goods 
remain in ‘B’s warehouse and the price is unpaid. Before delivery, ‘B’s warehouse is burnt down for no fault 
of ‘B’ and the goods are destroyed. ‘A’ must pay ‘B’ the price of the goods, as he was the owner. The rule is 
resperit domino- the loss falls on the owner. 
But the parties may agree that risk will pass at the time different from the time when ownership passed. For 
example, the seller may agree to be responsible for the goods even after the ownership is passed to the 
buyer or vice versa. 
In Consolidated Coffee Ltd. v. Coffee Board, (1980 3 SCC 358), one of the terms adopted by coffee board 
for auction of coffee was the property in the coffee knocked down to a bidder would not pass until the 
                                                                       Lesson 22        Sale of Goods Act, 1930 
565 
payment of price and in the meantime the goods would remain with the seller but at the risk of the buyer, In 
such cases, risk and property passes on at different stages. 
In Multanmal Champalal v. Shah & Co., AIR (1970) Mysore 106, goods were despatched by the seller from 
Bombay to Bellary through a public carrier. According to the terms of the contract, the goods were to remain 
the property of the seller till the price was paid though the risk was to pass to the buyer when they were 
delivered to public carrier for despatch. When the goods were subsequently lost before the payment of the 
price (and the consequent to the passing of the property to the buyer), the Court held that the loss was to be 
borne by the buyer. 
It was further held in the same case that the buyer was at fault in delaying delivery unreasonably and 
therefore on that ground also he was liable for the loss, because such loss would not have arisen but for 
such delay. 
Thus, where delivery has been delayed through the fault of either the buyer or the seller, in such a case, the 
goods are at the risk of the party at fault as regards any loss which might not have occurred but for such 
fault. 
Transfer of Title by Person not the Owner (Section 27-30) 
The general rule is that only the owner of goods can sell the goods. Conversely, the sale of an article by a 
person who is not or who has not the authority of the owner, gives no title to the buyer. The rule is expressed 
by the maxim; “Nemo Dat Quod Non Habet” i.e. no one can pass a better title than he himself has. As 
applied to the sale of goods, the rule means that a seller of goods cannot give a better title to the buyer than 
he himself possess. Thus, even a bona fide buyer who buys stolen goods from a thief or from a transfree 
from such a thief can get no valid title to them, since the thief has no title, nor could he give one to any 
transferee. 
Example: 
 
1. A, the hirer of goods under a hire purchase agreement, sells them to B, then B, though a bona fide 
purchaser, does not acquire the property in the goods. At most he can acquire such an interest as 
the hirer had. 
 
2. A finds a ring of B and sells it to a third person who purchases it for value and in good faith. The true 
owner, i.e. B can recover from that person, for A having no title to the ring could pass none the 
better. 
Exception to the General Rule 
The Act while recognizing the general rule that no one can give a better title than he himself has, laid down 
important exceptions to it. Under the exceptions the buyer gets a better title to the goods than the seller 
himself. These exceptions are given below: 
 
(a) Sale by a mercantile agent: A buyer will get a good title if he buys in good faith from a mercantile 
agent who is in possession either of the goods or documents of title to the goods with the consent of 
the owner, and who sells the goods in the ordinary course of his business. 
 
(b) Sale by a co-owner: A buyer who buys in good faith from one of the several joint owners who is in 
sole possession of the goods with the permission of his co-owners will get good title to the goods. 
 
(c) Sale by a person in possession under a voidable contract: A buyer buys in good faith from a person 
in possession of goods under a contract which is voidable, but has not been rescinded at the time of 
the sale. 
EP-EBCL 
566 
 
(d) Sale by seller in possession after sale: Where a seller, after having sold the goods, continues or is 
in possession of the goods or of the documents of title to the goods and again sells them by himself 
or through his mercantile agent to a person who buys in good faith and without notice of the 
previous sale, such a buyer gets a good title to the goods. 
 
(e) Sale by buyer in possession: If a person has brought or agreed to buy goods obtains, with the 
seller’s consent, possession of the goods or of the documents of title to them, any sale by him or by 
his mercantile agent to a buyer who takes in good faith without notice of any lien or other claim of 
the original seller against the goods, will give a good title to the buyer. In any of the above cases, if 
the transfer is by way of pledge or pawn only, it will be valid as a pledge or pawn. 
 
(f) Estoppel: If the true owner stands by and allows an innocent buyer to pay over money to a third-
party, who professes to have the right to sell an article, the true owner will be estopped from 
denying the third-party’s right to sell. 
 
(g) Sale by an unpaid seller: Where an unpaid seller has exercised his right of lien or stoppage in 
transit and is in possession of the goods, he may resell them and the second buyer will get absolute 
right to the goods. 
 
(h) Sale by person under other laws: A pawnee, on default of the pawnee to repay, has a right to sell 
the goods, pawned and the buyer gets a good title to the goods. The finder of lost goods can also 
sell under certain circumstances. The Official Assignee or Official Receiver, Liquidator, Officers of 
Court selling under a decree, Executors, and Administrators, all these persons are not owners, but 
they can convey better title than they have. 
Performance of the Contract of Sale 
It is the duty of the seller and buyer that the contract is performed. The duty of the seller is to deliver the 
goods and that of the buyer is to accept the goods and pay for them in accordance with the contract of sale. 
Unless otherwise agreed, payment of the price and the delivery of the goods are concurrent conditions, i.e., 
they both take place at the same time as in a cash sale over a shop counter. 
Delivery (Sections 33-39) 
Delivery is the voluntary transfer of possession from one person to another. Delivery may be actual, 
constructive or symbolic. Actual or physical delivery takes place where the goods are handed over by the 
seller to the buyer or his agent authorised to take possession of the goods. Constructive delivery takes place 
when the person in possession of the goods acknowledges that he holds the goods on behalf of and at the 
disposal of the buyer. For example, where the seller, after having sold the goods, may hold them as bailee 
for the buyer, there is constructive delivery. Symbolic delivery is made by indicating or giving a symbol. Here 
the goods themselves are not delivered, but the “means of obtaining possession” of goods is delivered, e.g, 
by delivering the key of the warehouse where the goods are stored, bill of lading which will entitle the holder 
to receive the goods on the arrival of the ship. 
Rules as to delivery 
The following rules apply regarding delivery of goods: 
 
(a) Delivery should have the effect of putting the buyer in possession. 
 
(b) The seller must deliver the goods according to the contract. 
 
(c) The seller is to deliver the goods when the buyer applies for delivery; it is the duty of the buyer to 
                                                                       Lesson 22        Sale of Goods Act, 1930 
567 
claim delivery. 
 
(d) Where the goods at the time of the sale are in the possession of a third person, there will be 
delivery only when that person acknowledges to the buyer that he holds the goods on his behalf. 
 
(e) The seller should tender delivery so that the buyer can take the goods. It is no duty of the seller to 
send or carry the goods to the buyer unless the contract so provides. But the goods must be in a 
deliverable state at the time of delivery or tender of delivery. If by the contract the seller is bound to 
send the goods to the buyer, but no time is fixed, the seller is bound to send them within a 
reasonable time. 
 
(f) The place of delivery is usually stated in the contract. Where it is so stated, the goods must be 
delivered at the specified place during working hours on a working day. Where no place is 
mentioned, the goods are to be delivered at a place at which they happen to be at the time of the 
contract of sale and if not then in existence they are to be delivered at the place at which they are 
manufactured or produced. 
 
(g) The seller has to bear the cost of delivery unless the contract otherwise provides. While the cost of 
obtaining delivery is said to be of the buyer, the cost of the putting the goods into deliverable state 
must be borne by the seller. In other words, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, the 
expenses of and incidental to making delivery of the goods must be borne by the seller, the 
expenses of and incidental to receiving delivery must be borne by the buyer. 
 
(h) If the goods are to be delivered at a place other than where they are, the risk of deterioration in transit 
will, unless otherwise agreed, be borne by the buyer. 
 
(i) Unless otherwise agreed, the buyer is not bound to accept delivery in instalments. 
Acceptance of Goods by the Buyer 
Acceptance of the goods by the buyer takes place when the buyer: 
 
(a) intimates to the seller that he has accepted the goods; or 
 
(b) retains the goods, after the lapse of a reasonable time without intimating to the seller that he has 
rejected them; or 
 
(c) does any act on the goods which is inconsistent with the ownership of the seller, e.g., pledges or 
resells. If the seller sends the buyer a larger or smaller quantity of goods than ordered, the buyer 
may: 
 
(i) reject the whole; or 
 
(ii) accept the whole; or 
 
(ii) accept the quantity be ordered and reject the rest. 
If the seller delivers with the goods ordered, goods of a wrong description, the buyer may accept the goods 
ordered and reject the rest, or reject the whole. 
Where the buyer rightly rejects the goods, he is not bound to return the rejected goods to the seller. It is 
sufficient if he intimates the seller that he refuses to accept them. In that case, the seller has to remove them. 
Instalment Deliveries 
When there is a contract for the sale of goods to be delivered by stated instalments which are to be 
EP-EBCL 
568 
separately paid for, and either the buyer or the seller commits a breach of contract, it depends on the terms 
of the contract whether the breach is a repudiation of the whole contract or a severable breach merely giving 
right to claim for damages. 
Suits for Breach of Contract 
Where the property in the goods has passed to the buyer, the seller may sue him for the price. 
Where the price is payable on a certain day regardless of delivery, the seller may sue for the price, if it is not 
paid on that day, although the property in the goods has not passed. 
Where the buyer wrongfully neglects or refuses to accept the goods and pay for them, the seller may sue the 
buyer for damages for non-acceptance. 
Where the seller wrongfully neglects or refuses to deliver the goods to the buyer, the buyer may sue him for 
damages for non-delivery. 
Where there is a breach of warranty or where the buyer elects or is compelled to treat the breach of condition 
as a breach of warranty, the buyer cannot reject the goods. He can set breach of warranty in extinction or 
dimunition of the price payable by him and if loss suffered by him is more than the price he may sue for the 
damages. 
If the buyer has paid the price and the goods are not delivered, the buyer can sue the seller for the recovery 
of the amount paid. In appropriate cases the buyer can also get an order from the court that the specific 
goods ought to be delivered. 
Anticipatory Breach 
Where either party to a contract of sale repudiates the contract before the date of delivery, the other party 
may either treat the contract as still subsisting and wait till the date of delivery, or he may treat the contract 
as rescinded and sue for damages for the breach. 
In case the contract is treated as still subsisting it would be for the benefit of both the parties and the party 
who had originally repudiated will not be deprived of: 
 
(a) his right of performance on the due date in spite of his prior repudiation; or 
 
(b) his rights to set up any defence for non-performance which might have actually arisen after the date 
of the prior repudiation. 
Measure of Damages 
The Act does not specifically provide for rules as regards the measure of damages except by stating that 
nothing in the Act shall affect the right of the seller or the buyer to recover interest or special damages in any 
case where by law they are entitled to the same. The inference is that the rules laid down in Section 73 of the 
Indian Contract Act will apply. 
Unpaid Seller (Sections 45-54) 
Who is an unpaid seller? (Section 45) 
The seller of goods is deemed to be unpaid seller: 
 
(a) When the whole of the price has not been paid or tendered; or 
                                                                       Lesson 22        Sale of Goods Act, 1930 
569 
 
(b) When a conditional payment was made by a bill of exchange or other negotiable instrument, and 
the instrument has been dishonoured. 
Rights of an Unpaid Seller against the Goods 
An unpaid seller’s right against the goods are: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a) Right of Lien (Sections 47-49 and 54) An unpaid seller in possession of goods sold, may exercise his lien 
on the goods, i.e., keep the goods in his possession and refuse to deliver them to the buyer until the 
fulfilment or tender of the price in cases where: 
 
(i) the goods have been sold without stipulation as to credit; or 
 
(ii) the goods have been sold on credit, but the term of credit has expired; or 
 
(iii) the buyer becomes insolvent. 
The lien depends on physical possession. The seller’s lien is possessory lien, so that it can be exercised only 
so long as the seller is in possession of the goods. It can only be exercised for the non-payment of the price 
and not for any other charges. 
A lien is lost 
 
(i) When the seller delivers the goods to a carrier or other bailee for the purpose of transmission to the 
buyer, without reserving the right of disposal of the goods; 
 
(ii) When the buyer or his agent lawfully obtains possession of the goods; 
 
(iii) By waiver of his lien by the unpaid seller. 
(b) Stoppage in transit (Sections 50-52) The right of stoppage in transit is a right of stopping the goods while 
they are in transit, resuming possession of them and retaining possession until payment of the price. 
The right to stop goods is available to an unpaid seller 
EP-EBCL 
570 
 
(i) when the buyer becomes insolvent; and 
 
(ii) the goods are in transit. 
The buyer is insolvent if he has ceased to pay his debts in the ordinary course of business, or cannot pay his 
debts as they become due. It is not necessary that he has actually been declared insolvent by the court. 
The goods are in transit from the time they are delivered to a carrier or other bailee like a wharfinger or 
warehousekeeper for the purpose of transmission to the buyer and until the buyer takes delivery of them. 
The transit comes to an end in the following cases: 
 
(i) If the buyer obtains delivery before the arrival of the goods at their destination; 
 
(ii) If, after the arrival of the goods at their destination, the carrier acknowledges to the buyer that he 
holds the goods on his behalf, even if further destination of the goods is indicated by the buyer; 
 
(iii) If the carrier wrongfully refuses to deliver the goods to the buyer. 
If the goods are rejected by the buyer and the carrier or other bailee holds them, the transit will be deemed to 
continue even if the seller has refused to receive them back. 
The right to stop in transit may be exercised by the unpaid seller either by taking actual possession of the 
goods or by giving notice of the seller’s claim to the carrier or other person having control of the goods. On 
notice being given to the carrier, he must redeliver the goods to the seller who must pay the expenses of the 
redelivery. 
The seller’s right of lien or stoppage in transit is not affected by any sale on the part of the buyer unless the 
seller has assented to it. A transfer, however, of the bill of lading or other document of seller to a bona fide 
purchaser for value is valid against the seller’s right. 
(c) Right of re-sale (Section 54): The unpaid seller may re-sell: 
 
(i) where the goods are perishable; 
 
(ii) where the right is expressly reserved in the contract; 
 
(iii) where in exercise of right of lien or stoppage in transit, the seller gives notice to the buyer of his 
intention to re-sell, and the buyer, does not pay or tender the price within a reasonable time. 
 
 If on a re-sale, there is a deficiency between the price due and amount realised, he is entitled to 
recover it from the buyer. If there is a surplus, he can keep it. He will not have these rights if he has 
not given any notice and he will have to pay the buyer profit, if any, on the resale. 
(d) Rights to withhold delivery: If the property in the goods has passed, the unpaid seller has right as 
described above. If, however, the property has not passed, the unpaid seller has a right of withholding 
delivery similar to and co-extensive with his rights of lien and stoppage in transit. 
Rights of an unpaid seller against the buyer (Sections 55 and 56) 
An unpaid seller may sue the buyer for the price of the goods in case of breach of contract where the 
property in the goods has passed to the buyer or he has wrongfully refused to pay the price according to the 
terms of the contract. 
The seller may sue the buyer even if the property in the goods has not passed where the price is payable on 
a certain day. 
Under Section 56, the seller may sue the buyer for damages or breach of contract where the buyer 
wrongfully neglects or refuses to accept and pay for the goods. 
                                                                       Lesson 22        Sale of Goods Act, 1930 
571 
Thus an unpaid sellers rights against the buyer personally are: 
 
(a) a suit for the price. 
 
(b) a suit for damages. 
Auction Sales (Section 64) 
A sale by auction is a public sale where goods are offered to be taken by bidders. It is a proceeding at which 
people are invited to complete for the purchase of property by successive offer of advancing sums. 
Section 64 lays down the rules regulating auction sales. Where goods are put up for sale in lots, each, lot is 
prima facie deemed to be the subject of a separate contract of sale. The sale is complete when the 
auctioneer announces its completion by the fall of the hammer or in other customary manner. Until such 
announcement is made, any bidder may retract his bid. 
A right to bid may be reserved expressly by or on behalf of the seller. Where such right is expressly so 
reserved, the seller or any other person on his behalf may bid at the auction. Where the sale is not notified to 
be subject to a right to bid on behalf of the seller, it shall not be lawful for the seller to bid himself or to employ 
any person to bid at such sale, or for the auctioneer knowingly to take any bid from the seller or any such 
person. Any sale in contravention of this rule may be treated as fraudulent by the buyer. The sale may be 
notified to be subject to a reserved price. Where there is such notification, every bid is a conditional offer 
subject to its being up to the reserve price. Where an auctioneer inadvertently knocks down to a bidder who 
has bid less than the reserved price, there is no contract of sale. If the seller makes use of pretended bidding to 
raise the price, the sale is voidable at the option of the buyer. 
Trading Contracts Involving Rail or Sea Transit 
In the case of a contract for the sale of goods which are to be shipped by sea a number of conditions are 
attached by the parties or by custom and practice of merchants. Some of the important types of such 
contracts are given below: 
 
(a) F.O.B.(Free on Board): Under an F.O.B. contract, it is the duty of the seller to put the goods on 
board a ship at his own expenses. The property in goods passes to the buyer only after the goods 
have been put on board the ship, and they are at buyer’s risk as soon as they are put on board the 
ship, usually named by the buyer. The seller must notify the buyer immediately that the goods have 
been delivered on board, so that the buyer may insure them. If he fails to do so the goods shall be 
deemed to be at seller’s risk during such sea transit. 
 
(b) F.O.R. (Free on Rail): Similar position prevails in these contracts as in the case of F.O.B. contracts. 
 
(c) C.I.F. or C.F.I. (Cost Insurance and Freight): A CIF contract is a contract for the sale of insured 
goods lost or not lost to be implemented by transfer of proper documents. 
 
 In such types of contracts, the seller not only bears all the expenses of putting the goods on board 
the ship as in an F.O.B. contract, but also to bear the freight and insurance charges. He will arrange 
for an insurance of the goods for the benefit of the buyer. On the tender of documents, the buyer is 
required to pay and then take delivery. He has a right to reject the goods if they are not according to 
the contract. 
 
(d) Ex-Ship: Here the seller is bound to arrange the shipment of the goods to the port of destination, 
and to such further inland destination as the buyer may stipulate. The buyer is not bound to pay until 
the goods are ready for unloading from the ship and all freight charges paid. The goods travel at the 
seller’s risk, but he is not bound to insure them.

LESSON ROUND-UP 
• 
In a sale, the property in the goods sold passes to the buyer at the time of contract so that he 
becomes the owner of the goods. In an agreement to sell, the ownership does not pass to the buyer 
at the time of the contract, but it passes only when it becomes sale on the expiry of certain time or 
the fulfilment of some conditions subject to which the property in the goods is to be transferred. 
• 
Where goods are delivered to another on terms which indicate that the property is to pass at once 
the contract must be one of sale and not bailment. 
• 
The subject matter of the contract of sale is essentially goods. According to Section 2(7) of the Sale 
of Goods Act, “goods” means every kind of movable property other than actionable claims and 
money and includes stock and shares, growing crops, grass and things attached to or forming part of 
the land which are agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract of sale. Goods may be (a) 
existing, (b) future, or (c) contingent. The existing goods may be (i) specific or generic, (ii) 
ascertained or unascertained. 
• 
The sole purpose of a sale is the transfer of ownership of goods from the seller to the buyer. The 
general rule is that only the owner of goods can sell the goods. Conversely, the sale of an article by 
a person who is not or who has not the authority of the owner, gives no title to the buyer. 
• 
It is the duty of the seller and buyer that the contract is performed. The duty of the seller is to deliver 
the goods and that of the buyer to accept the goods and pay for them in accordance with the 
contract of sale. 
• 
Unless otherwise agreed, payment of the price and the delivery of the goods and concurrent 
conditions, i.e., they both take place at the same time as in a cash sale over a shop counter. 
• 
Delivery is the voluntary transfer of possession from one person to another. Delivery may be actual, 
constructive or symbolic. 
• 
A sale by auction is a public sale where goods are offered to be taken by bidders. It is a proceeding 
at which people are invited to complete for the purchase of property by successive offer of advancing 
sums.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Likewise  corporations which  are regulated  by 
Companies Act,  2013,  the  other  form  of business 
is  partnership which is  regulated by Indian 
Partnership Act, 1932. The partnership is considered 
as the convenient way to start a business. Suppose 
one wants to open a bookshop in the locality.  There  
are  various things  that  are  required  to  start  and  
run  the business which may not be feasible to 
arrange all alone. These may include resources from 
money to place to management. In that case, the 
idea may be spoken to friends and relatives who  
may  agree  to  run  the  bookshop  by contributing  a  
certain  amount  of  money  and other things 
required. So all of them join hands together to 
become the owners and agree to share profits and 
losses. 
This  chapter  deals  with  laws  relating  to 
partnership  that  will  regulate  this  form  of 
business,  its  registration,  admission  of  new 
partners, and dissolution. It also explains other 
aspects of partnership like kinds of partners, 
relationship among themselves and with others. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
There's an assumption by many partners that no matter what happens to their business, they'll be partners forever.

INTRODUCTION 
The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, came into force w.e.f.  1st October, 1932 except section 69, which came  
into force on the 1st day of October, 1933. It extends to the whole of India except the state of Jammu and 
Kashmir. 
It lays down the important provisions relating to partnership contracts. However, the general principles of the 
Indian Contracts Act, 1872 which formally contained the provisions of the law of partnership shall apply so far 
as they are not inconsistent with this Act. (Section 3) 
DEFINITIONS 
 
Partnership 
According to Section 4 “Partnership is the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of 
a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all”. 
When analysed, the definition tells us that in order that persons may become partners, it is essential that: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All these four elements must be present before a group or an association can be held to be partners. In other 
words, it can be said that all the aforestated four elements must co-exist before a partnership can be said to 
come into existence. If any one of them is not proved to be present, there cannot be a partnership. The first 
element relates to the voluntary contractual nature of partnership; the second gives the motive which leads to 
the formation of firms, i.e. the acquisition of gains; the third shows that the persons of the group who conduct 
the business  do so as agents for all the persons in the group, and are therefore liable to account to all the 
persons in the group (Maliram Choudhary v. Jagannath, AIR 1972 Orissa 17). 
Partners, Firm and Firm Name 
 Persons who have entered into partnership with one another are called individually “partners” and 
collectively “a firm”, and the name under which their business is carried on is called the “firm name”. 
(Section 4) 
                                                                       Lesson 23        Indian Partnership Act, 1932 
575 
In law, “a firm” is only a convenient phrase for describing the partners, and the firm has no legal existence 
apart from its partners. It is neither a legal entity, nor is it a person as is a corporation; it is a collective name 
of the members of a partnership. 
As regard the “firm name”, partners have a right to carry on business under any name and style which they 
choose to adopt, provided they do not violate the rules relating to trade name or goodwill. They must not 
adopt name calculated to mislead the public into confusing them with a firm of repute already in existence 
with a similar name. They must not use a name implying the sanction of patronage of the Government. A 
partnership firm cannot use the word “Limited” as a part of its name. 
Essentials of a Partnership and True Test of Partnership 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These elements are discussed below in detail: 
(1) Association of two or more persons 
There must be a contract between two or more persons. Therefore unless there are at least two persons 
there can not be a partnership. Persons must be competent to enter into a contract. They may all be natural 
or artificial or some natural and other artificial. Thus a corporation or limited partnership may itself be a 
partner in a general partnership. 
(2) Agreement 
Existence of an agreement is essential of partnership. Section 5 of the Act states that the relation of 
partnership arises from contract and not from status; and in particular, the members of a Hindu Undivided 
Family carrying on a family business as such, or a Burmese Buddhist Husband and wife carrying on 
business as such are not partners in such business. 
Such an agreement between the partners may be express or implied. Further, the agreement must be a valid 
agreement and for a lawful object and purpose and between the persons competent to contract. 
(3) Business 
Partnership implies business and when there is no association to carry on business there is no partnership. 
EP-EBCL 
576 
The term “business” is, however, used in the widest sense to cover trade, occupation and profession. As per 
Section 2(b) of the Act the term “business” includes every trade, occupation and profession. In the definition 
of partnership the word “business” is used in the sense of “carrying on business” which suggests continuity 
or repetition of acts. But it does not mean that it should be confined to lengthy operations, it may consist of a 
single adventure of a single undertaking, if there is continued participation of two or more persons for 
acquisition of gains. 
The term must be understood in a particular sense . It refers to any activity which, if successful, would result 
in profit. 
(4) Sharing of Profits 
To constitute a partnership, the parties must have agreed to carry on a business and to share profits in 
common. “Profits” mean the excess of returns over advances, the excess of what is obtained over the cost of 
obtaining it. Sharing of profits also involves sharing of losses. But whereas the sharing of profit is an 
essential element of partnership, the sharing of losses is not. It is open to one or more partners to bear all 
the losses of the business. 
It follows that the sharing of profits is an essential ingredient of partnership and there would be no 
partnership where only one of the partners is entitled to the whole of the profits of the business. But it is open 
to the partners to agree to share the profits in any way they like. They may agree to share the profits either in 
specific proportions or in specific sums.  
Sharing of Profits is not Conclusive 
Test Although sharing of profits is a prima facie evidence of the existence of partnership, this is not the 
conclusive test of the same.  A person may have a share in the partnership profits, but still may not be a 
partner. For instance, a joint owner of a property sharing its return or members of non-profit or non-trading 
associations will not be called partners. 
Illustrations 
 
1.  A and B buy 100 bales of cotton, which they agree to sell for their joint account, each party sharing 
profits and bearing losses equally. A and B are partners in respect of such account. 
 
2.  A and B buy 100 bales of cotton agreeing to divide these between them. A and B are not partners. 
 
3. “A” a trader, owed money to XY&Z. He agreed to pay XY&Z out of the profits of his business (run 
under the supervision of X, Y and Z) what he owed to them. It was held that the arrangement does 
not make X, Y and Z the partners with A in the business. 
(5) Mutual Agency The True Test 
Mutual agency is the foundation of partner’s liability. Each partner is both an agent and principal for himself 
and others; that is the significance of the phrase “carried on by all or any of them acting for all”. Each partner 
is an agent binding the other partners who are his principal and each partner is again a principal, who in turn 
is bound by the acts of the other partners. In other words, there must be facts or circumstances from which it 
can be inferred that each of the persons alleged to be partners was the agent, real or implied of another. 
What is essential is that the partner who conducts the business of the firm not only acts for himself but for the 
other partners also. 
The true test, therefore, in determining whether a partnership exists, is to see whether the relation of 
principal and agent exists between the parties and not merely whether the parties share the profits or the 
                                                                       Lesson 23        Indian Partnership Act, 1932 
577 
business is carried on for the benefit of all. It is this relation of agency among partners which distinguishes a 
partnership from a single co-ownership on the one hand and the agreement to share profits on the other. The 
existence of this relation of agency can be gathered from the real intention of the parties and the 
circumstances of the case. The question of intention must be decided on the basis of the conduct of parties 
and of all the surrounding circumstances. The law of partnership is the extention of the law of agency 
therefore every partner is liable for the act of other partner if within authority upto unlimited extent. The 
relation of mutual agency is the conclusive test of partnership. 
It may be observed that the question whether a person is or is not a partner depends almost in all cases 
upon whether he has the authority to act for other partners and whether other partners have the authority to 
act for him. It follows that the agency relationship is the most important test of partnership. 
Formation of Partnership 
According to the definition of partnership under the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, there must be an 
agreement between the partners of a partnership firm. 
The partnership agreement must comply with all the essentials of a valid contract. There must be free 
consent of the parties who must be competent to contract and the object of partnership should not be 
forbidden by law or immoral or opposed to public policy. Two exceptions, however, may be noted: 
 
(i) A minor may be admitted to the benefits of a partnership with the consent of all other partners. 
 
(ii) As relations of partners inter se are that of agency, no consideration is required to create the 
partnership. 
Partnership Deed 
The agreement of partnership may be oral but to avoid future disputes it is always advisable to have it in 
writing. The mutual rights and obligations of partners must be discussed in detail and should be put into 
writing in the shape of a ‘Partnership Deed’, before the partnership is actually started. Thus, the written 
document which contains the mutual rights and obligations of partners is known as partnership deed. (The 
partnership deed is also called as ‘Partnership Agreement’, ‘Constitution of Partnership’, ‘Articles of 
Partnership’ etc.). The deed must be property drafted and stamped according to the provisions of the Indian 
Stamp Act. Each partner should be given a copy of the deed and if the firm is to be registered, a copy of the 
deed should be filed with the Registrar of Firms at the time of such legislation. The partnership deed is not a 
public document and therefore binds only third parties so far as they have notice of it. 
Contents of Partnership Deed 
The exact terms of the partnership deed (or agreement) will depend upon the circumstances  but  generally  
a partnership deed contains the following covenants: 
 
(i) The firm name and business to be carried on under that name. 
 
(ii) Names and addresses of partners. 
 
(ii) Nature and scope of business and address(s) of business place(s). 
 
(iv) Commencement and duration of partnership. 
 
(v) The capital and the contribution made by each partner. 
 
(vi) Provision for further capital and loans by partners to the firm. 
 (vii) Partner’s drawings. 
EP-EBCL 
578 
 (viii) Interest on capital, loans, drawings and current account. 
 
(ix) Salaries, commission and remuneration to partners, 
 
(x) Profit (or loss) sharing ratio of partners. 
 
(xi) The keeping of proper books of accounts, inspection and audit, Bank Accounts and their operation. 
 (xii) The accounting period and the date on which that accounts are to be prepared. 
 (xiii) Rights, powers and duties of the partners.  
 (xiv) Whether and in what circumstances, notice of retirement or dissolution can be given by a partner. 
 (xv) Provision that death or retirement of a partner will not bring about dissolution of partnership, 
 (xvi) Valuation of goodwill on retirement, death, dissolution etc. 
 (xvii) The method of valuation of assets (and liabilities) on retirement or death  of  any partner. 
 (xviii) Provision for expulsion of a partner. 
 (xix) Provision regarding the allocation of business activities to be performed by individual partners. 
 (xx) The arbitration clause for the settlement of disputes. The terms contained in the partnership deed 
may be varied with the consent of all the parties, and such consent may be express or implied by a 
course of dealing. [Section 11(1)] 
Classification of Partnership 
A partnership may either be for a particular adventure or for a fixed period. It may also be a partnership at 
will. From the duration point of view, a partnership may be classified into the following two categories: 
(i) Particular Partnership (Section 8) 
“A person may become a partner with another person in a particular adventure or undertaking”. When two or 
more persons agree to do business in a particular adventure or undertaking, such a partnership is called 
“Particular Partnership”. Thus, a particular partnership may even be for a single adventure or undertaking. 
(ii) Partnership at Will (Section 7) 
“Where no provision is made by contract between the partners for the duration of their partnership or for the 
determination of their partnership, the partnership is called Partnership at Will”. A partnership is deemed to 
be a partnership at will when (i) no fixed period has been agreed upon for the duration of partnership, and (ii) 
there is no provision made as to the determination of partnership in any other way. The partnership at will 
has no fixed or definite date of termination and, therefore, death or retirement of a partner does not affect the 
existence of such partnership. 
Section 43(1) provides that “Where the partnership is at will, the firm may be dissolved by any partner giving 
notice in writing to all the other partners of his intention to dissolve the firm. The firm is dissolved as from the 
date mentioned in the notice as the date of dissolution or, if no such date is mentioned, as from the date of 
communication of the notice”. This accounts for the importance of the definition of ‘Partnership at Will’. 
Co-ownership and Partnership 
There is a possibility that two co-owners may employ their property in a business and share the profits, and 
still be not partners. A distinction between the two is in point. Partnership is between two persons Co- 
ownership is not always the result of an agreement: it may arise by the operation of law or from status, e.g., 
co-heirs of a property. Partnership must arise from an agreement. A partner is the agent of the other 
                                                                       Lesson 23        Indian Partnership Act, 1932 
579 
partners, but a co-owner is not the agent of the other co-owner(s). Co-ownership does not necessarily 
involve community of profits and loss, partnership does. A co- owner can without the consent of the others 
transfer his rights and interests to strangers, a partner cannot do so without the consent of all the other 
partners so as to make the transferee a partner in the firm. A co-owner can ask for division of property in 
specie, but no partner can ask for this. His only right is to have a share of the profits out of the properties. 
Partnerships end at death or insolvency; co-ownerships end at death. A co-owner has no lien on the property 
while a partner has a lien on the firm property. 
Hindu Joint Family Firm and Partnership 
A Hindu joint family firm differs from a partnership in the following ways: 
A partnership comes into existence by means of a contract between the partners; a Hindu joint family firm 
arises as a result of status, i.e., by birth in the family. The death of a partner dissolves the partnership, but 
the death of a co-parcener does not dissolve the family firm. In a joint family firm only the Karta or manager 
(who is the head of the family) has implied authority to borrow and bind other members; in a partnership 
each partner is entitled to do so. Every partner is personally liable for the debts of the firm; in a joint family 
business only the Karta is personally liable. A minor is a member of a joint family firm from the very day of his 
birth by virtue of his status, but he is not personally liable. A minor cannot be a partner, although he may be 
admitted to the benefits of partnership. A partner can demand the accounts of the firm, a co-parcener cannot 
ask for accounts, his only remedy is to ask for partition of the assets of the family firm. No registration of a 
family firm is necessary, while a partnership firm must be registered before it can maintain suits against 
outsiders. Each partner has a definite share in the business and this can be changed only by agreement, but 
the share of a co-parcener is not fixed; it may be enlarged by death or reduced by a birth in the family. There 
is a definite limit to the number of partners, but there is no such limit in the case of a Hindu joint family firm. A 
Hindu joint family business is governed by Hindu Law, while Indian Partnership Act, governs partnerships 
and excludes Hindu joint family firms. (Section 5) 
Company and Partnership 
The members constituting a partnership do not form a whole as distinct from the individuals composing it. 
The firm has no legal entity and has no rights and obligations separate from the partners. In a firm every 
partner is an agent of the rest of the partners, but a member of a company is neither the agent of the 
company nor of other members. A company, as soon as it is incorporated, say by registration under the 
Companies Act, becomes a legal entity distinct from its members constituting it (Salomon v. Salomon & Co., 
1897, A.C. 22). It can sue and be sued in its own name like any natural person. In a partnership, there are 
rights and obligations as against individual partners, but in the case of a company, the rights and obligations 
are as against the fictitious entity of the whole of the company and not the members composing it. The 
creditors of the partnership can call upon individual partners to pay the firm’s debt, but the members of a 
company  are not personally liable for the company’s debts. In other words, a partner’s liability is unlimited 
while the liability of the members of a company is limited to the extent of the amount remaining unpaid on 
their shares (Prasad v. Missir). Partnership firm may dissolve by the death or insolvency of a partner, but a 
company is not affected by the death or insolvency of a member. A partner cannot transfer his interest so as 
to substitute the transferee in his place as the partner, without the consent of all the other partners; a 
member can transfer his share to any one he likes. 
Change in a Firm 
The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, contemplates the following changes in a partnership firm: 
 
(1) Changes in the constitution of a firm. 
EP-EBCL 
580 
 
(2) Changes in the nature of a business or undertakings. 
 
(3) Changes in the duration of a firm. 
A change in the constitution of a firm takes place when: 
 
(a) a new partner is introduced as a partner in a firm; (Section 31) 
 
(b) a partner retires from a firm; (Section 32), 
 
(c) a partner is expelled from a firm; (Section 33), 
 
(d) a partner is adjudicated as an insolvent; (Section 34) and 
 
(e) a partner dies. (Section 35) 
A change in the nature of the business can only be brought about by the consent of all the partners. Thus, a 
partnership formed for a definite purpose, agreed upon at the time of formation of the partnership, cannot 
depart from the agreed purpose without the consent of all the partners [Section 12(c)]. Section 17(c)provides 
for a case whether a partnership firm is formed  for a particular undertaking or undertakings, it proceeds  to 
carry on other undertaking or undertakings, in that event the mutual rights and duties of the partners in 
respect of the other adventures or undertakings are the same as those in respect of the original adventures 
of undertakings. 
Partnership Property 
It is open to the partners to agree among themselves as to what is to be treated as the property of the firm, 
and what is to be separate property of one or more partners, although employed for the purposes of the firm. 
In the absence of any such agreement, express or implied, the property of the firm is deemed to include: 
 
(a) all property, rights and interests which have been brought into the common stock for the purposes 
of the partnership by individual partners, whether at the commencement of the business or 
subsequently added thereto; 
 
(b) those acquired in the course of the business with money belonging to the firm; and 
 
(c) the goodwill of the business. (Section 14) 
The property of the firm belongs to the firm and not to the individual partner or partners. The ownership 
belongs to the firm, and no partner can deal with specific properties as if the properties are his own, nor does 
the partner possess any assignable interest in such property (Narayanappa v. Bhaskaia Krishnappa, AIR 
1966 SC 1300). What is meant by the share of a partner is his proportion of the partnership assets after they 
are all realised and converted into money, and all the partnership debts and liabilities have been paid and 
discharged. If certain partners jointly own immovable property which they use for the purposes of the 
partnership business, the mere use of such property does not make such property as partnership property. 
Whether such property is or is not partnership property depends upon the agreement between the partners 
(Lachhman Dass v. Mrs. Gulab Devi, AIR 1936 ALL. 270). The ultimate test to determine the property of the 
firm is the real intention of the partners and the Court can take into consideration the following facts: 
 
(1) The source of the purchase money. 
 
(2) The reason due to which the property was purchased or acquired. 
 
(3) The object for which the property was purchased or acquired. 
 
(4) The mode in which the property was obtained. 
 
(5) The mode in which the property was dealt with. 
 
(6) The use to which the property was put to. 
                                                                       Lesson 23        Indian Partnership Act, 1932 
581 
All such facts are matter of evidence  and depend on the facts of each case. These facts indicate the 
intention of the parties but are not conclusive to make a property as partnership property. These facts can be 
established by entries in the books of account of the firm and of the partners, correspondence, the deed of 
partnership, etc.  
Kinds of Partners 
The following kinds of partners generally exist in a partnership: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(i) Actual, Active or Ostensible Partner 
These are the ordinary types of partners who invest money into the business of the firm, actively participate 
in the functioning and management of the business and share its profits or losses. Section 12(a) lays down 
that “Subject to contract between the partners, every partner is entitled to take part in the conduct of the 
business of the firm”. Such partner as actively participates in the firm’s business, binds himself and other 
partners by all his acts done in the usual course of partnership business. Such partner must give a public 
notice of his retirement from the firm in order to absolve (free) himself from liability for the acts of the other 
partners done after his retirement. 
(ii) Sleeping or Dormant Partner 
These partners invest money in the firm’s business and take their share of profits but do not participate in the 
functioning and management of the business. But even then their liability is unlimited. The Act specially 
provides that if an act is binding on the firm, every partner is liable for it. 
A sleeping partner can retire from the firm without giving any public notice to this effect. His liability for the 
acts of the firm ceases soon after retirement. Such partner has no duties to perform but is entitled to have 
access to books and accounts of the firm and he can have a copy of them. 
EP-EBCL 
582 
(iii) Nominal Partner 
Some people do not invest or participate in the management of the firm but only give their name to the 
business or firm. They are nominal partners but are liable to third parties for all the acts of the firm. Unlike a 
sleeping partner, they are known to the outsiders as partners in the firm, whereas actually they are not. 
(iv) Partner in Profits Only 
A partner who is entitled to share in the profits of a partnership firm without being liable to share the losses, 
is called a partner in profits only. Thus, a person who has sufficient capital but is not prepared to take risk 
may be admitted to the partnership by the other partners. Inspite of his specific position, he continues to be 
liable to the third parties for all acts of the firm, just like other parties. 
(v) Sub-Partner 
Where a partner agrees to share his profits in the firm with a third person, that third person is called a sub-
partner. Such a sub-partner has no rights or duties towards the firm and does not carry any liability for the 
debts of the firm. Also he cannot bind the firm or other partners by his acts. 
(vi) Partner by Estoppel or Holding Out 
If the behaviour of a person arouses misunderstanding that he is a partner in a firm (when actually he is not), 
such a person is estopped from later on denying the liabilities for the acts of the firm. Such person is called 
partner by estoppel and is liable to all third parties. 
Similarly, if a person who is declared to be a partner (when actually he is not) does not deny the fact that he 
is a partner, he being held out as a partner is responsible for all liability of the business. The law relating to 
partners by holding out is contained in Section 28 of the Act which lays down thus: 
“Any one who by words, spoken or written or by conduct represents himself, or knowingly permits himself to 
be represented to be a partner in a firm, is liable as a partner in that firm to any one who has on the faith of 
any such representation given credit to the firm, whether the person representing himself or represented to 
be a partner does or does not know that the representation has reached the person so giving credit”. The 
rule as to holding out is based on the doctrine of estoppel as contained in Section 115 of the Indian Evidence 
Act. 
Holding Out means “to represent”. Strangers, who hold themselves out or represent themselves to be 
partners in a firm, whereby they induce others to give credit to the partnership are called “Partners by 
Holding Out”. 
In case of “Partnership by Estoppel”, the representation is made by partners about a stranger within his 
knowledge and hearing and he does not contradict it. He is then held liable as a partner. 
Effects of Holding out 
The Holding Out partner becomes personally and individually liable for the acts of the firm. But he does not 
become a partner in the firm and is not entitled to any rights or claim upon the firm. An outsider, who has 
given credit to the firm thinking him to be a partner, can hold him liable as if he is a partner in that firm. As the 
liability of the partners is joint and several he can be held liable to pay the entire amount. But under the 
doctrine of subrogation as well as on the basis of quasi-contract, he can recover the amount so paid from the 
partners of the firm, if they are solvent. 
Exceptions to Holding Out 
The doctrine of Holding Out is not applicable in the following cases: 
                                                                       Lesson 23        Indian Partnership Act, 1932 
583 
 
1. It does not apply to cases of torts committed by partners. A person, therefore, cannot be held liable 
for the torts of another simply because that other person held himself to be his partner. 
 
2. It does not extend to bind the estate of a deceased partner, where after a partner’s death the 
business of the firm is continued in the old firm name. [Section 28(2)] 
 
3. It also does not apply where the Holding Out partner has been adjudicated insolvent. (Section 45) 
Minor Admitted to the Benefits of Partnership 
In view of Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the decision of the Privy Council in Nohori Bibi v. 
Dharmo Das Ghose, (1903) 30 I.A 114, a minor’s agreement is altogether void and unenforceable. An 
agreement is an essential ingredient in a partnership, it follows that a minor cannot enter into an agreement of 
partnership. On the same principle, a minor cannot be clothed with all the rights and obligations of a full-fledged 
partner through a guardian. Section 5 states “The relation of partnership arises from a contract...”  The minor is 
incompetent to contract and, therefore, partnership cannot come into existence if the parties to a contract of 
partnership consist of one major and one minor. The only provision that Section 30 makes is that with the 
“consent of all the partners for the time being, a minor can be admitted into the benefits of partnership to which 
a minor is going to be admitted”. A partnership firm cannot be formed with only minors as partners. There must 
be atleast two major partners before a minor is admitted into the benefits of partnership. 
Rights of Minor 
He is entitled to his agreed share and can inspect books of account of the firm [Section 30(2)].  He can bring 
a suit for account and his share when he intends to sever his connections with the firm, but not otherwise. 
[Section 30(4)] 
A minor who was admitted to the benefits during his  minority within six months of his attaining the age of 
majority or when  he  comes  to know of his being so admitted (whichever date is later), he has to elect 
whether he wants to become a partner, or sever his connection  with  the firm.  He may give public notice of 
his election to continue or repudiate, but if he fails to give any public notice within the period stated above, he 
will be deemed to have elected to become a partner in the firm. [Section 30(5)] 
Liabilities of Minor 
1. His Share in Liability 
A minor partner’s liability is confined only to the extent of his share in the firm. Section 30(3) provides that a 
minor’s share is liable for the acts of the firm. But a minor is not personally liable in any such act. Thus, he is 
neither personally liable nor is his private estate liable for the acts of the firm. 
2. Personal Liabilities 
Where a minor on attaining majority, elects to become a partner, he becomes personally liable as other 
partners to the third parties for all the acts of the firm done since he was admitted to the benefits of 
partnership. 
Election by Minor 
A minor who was admitted to the benefits during his minority within six months of his attaining the age of 
majority or when he comes to know of his being so admitted (whichever date is later), he has to elect 
whether he wants to become a partner, or sever his connection with the firm. He may give public notice of his 
election to continue or repudiate, but if he fails to give any public notice within the period stated above, he 
will be deemed to have elected to become a partner in the firm. [Section 30(5)] 
EP-EBCL 
584 
If he becomes or elects to become a partner, his position will be as under: 
 
1. His rights and liabilities will be similar to those of a full-fledged partner. 
 
2. He will be personally liable for all the acts of the firm, done since he was first admitted to the 
benefits of the partnership. 
 
3. His share of profits and property remains the same as was before, unless altered by agreement. 
If he elects not to become a partner, then: 
 
1. His rights and liabilities shall continue to be those of a minor upto the date of his giving public 
notice. 
 
2. His share shall not be liable for any acts of the firm done after the date of the public notice. 
 
3. He is entitled to sue the partners for his share of the property and profits in the firm. [Section 30(8)] 
Relation of Partners to one another 
The relation of partnership arises through an agreement between the parties and such an agreement 
normally provides for mutual rights and obligations, or duties of the partners. Where, however, partnership 
arises by implication, or wherever the articles of partnership are silent, or where they do not exist, the rights 
and duties of partners are governed by the Act. 
Rights of Partners 
Unless otherwise agreed by the partners, the following rules apply: 
 
(a) Every partner has a right to take part in the conduct and management of the business. [Section 
12(a)] 
 
(b) Every partner whether active or dormant, has a right of free access to all records, books and 
accounts of the business and also to examine and copy them. [Section 12(d)] 
 
(c) Every partner is entitled to share in the profits equally, unless different proportions are stipulated. 
[Section 13(b)] 
 
(d) A partner who has contributed more than the share of the capital for the purpose of the business is 
entitled to an interest at a rate agreed upon, and where no rate is stipulated for, at six per cent per 
annum. But a partner cannot claim interest on capital, unless there is an agreement to pay it. 
[Section 13(d)] 
 
(e) A partner is entitled to be indemnified by the firm for all expenses incurred by him in the course of 
the business, for all payments made by him in respect of partnership debts or liabilities and 
disbursements made in an emergency for protecting the firm from loss. [Section 13(e)] 
 
(f) Every partner is, as a rule, a joint owner of the partnership property, and have it applied exclusively 
for the purposes of the partnership. (Section 15) 
 
(g) A partner has power to act in an emergency for protecting the firm from loss. (Section 21) 
 
(h) Every partner is entitled to prevent the introduction of a new partner into the firm without his 
consent. (Section 31) 
 
(i) Every partner has a right to retire by giving notice where the partnership is at will. [Section 32(1)(c)] 
 
(j) Every partner has a right to continue in the partnership and not to be expelled from it. [Section 
33(1)] 
                                                                       Lesson 23        Indian Partnership Act, 1932 
585 
 
(k) An incoming partner will not be liable for any debts or liabilities of the firm before he becomes a 
partner. [Section 31(2)] (l) 
 
(l) Every outgoing partner has a right to carry on a competitive business under certain conditions. 
(Section 36) 
Duties of Partners 
Apart from any duties imposed by the partnership articles, the following statutory duties are implied: 
 
(a) Every partner is bound to carry on the business of the firm to the greatest common advantage. 
(Section 9) 
 
(b) Every partner must be just and faithful to other partners. (Section 9) 
 
(c) A partner is bound to keep and render true, proper and correct accounts of the partnership. (Section 
9) 
 
(d) Utmost good faith between the partners is the rule and one partner must not take advantage of the 
other. As an agent of other partners, every partner is bound to communicate full information to 
them. (Section 9) 
 
(e) Every partner must account for any benefits derived from the partnership business without the 
consent of the other partners, i.e., a partner must not make “secret profits”. [Section 16(a)] 
 
(f) A partner must not compete with the firm, without the consent of the other partners. Any profits 
made by such unauthorised competition can be claimed by the firm. [Section 16(b)] 
 
(g) Every partner is bound to attend diligently to the business of the firm and in the absence of any 
agreement to the contrary, he is not entitled to receive any remuneration. [Section 12(b) and 13(a)] 
 
(h) In the absence of an agreement to the contrary, every partner is bound to share losses equally with 
the others. [Section 13(b)] 
 
(i) Every partner must hold and use the partnership property exclusively for the firm. (Section 15) 
 
(j) Every partner is bound to indemnify the firm for any loss caused by fraud in the conduct of the 
business. (Section 10) 
 
(k) A partner who is guilty of wilful neglect in the conduct of the business and the firm suffers loss in 
consequence, is bound to make compensation to the firm and other partners. [Section 13(f)] 
 
(l) No partner can assign or transfer his partnership interest to any other person, so as to make him a 
partner in the business. (Section 29) 
 (m) But a partner may assign the profits and share in the partnership assets. But the assignee or 
transferee will have no right to ask for the accounts or to interfere in the management of the 
business; he would be entitled only to share the actual profits. On dissolution of the firm, he will be 
entitled to the share of the assets and also to accounts but only from the date of dissolution. 
(Section 29) 
 
(n) Every partner is bound to act within the scope of his actual authority. If he exceeds his authority, he 
shall compensate the other partners for loss unless they ratify his act. 
Relation of Partners to Third Parties 
 
Partners as Agents 
Every partner is an agent of the firm and of other partners for the purpose of the business of the firm (Section 
18). In the case of a partnership each partner is a principal and each one is an agent for the other partners. A 
EP-EBCL 
586 
partner is both a principal and an agent. Thus, the general law of agency is incorporated into the law of 
partnership. The law of partnership is often regarded as branch of the law of agency. The acts of every 
partner who does any act for carrying on in the usual way the business of the kind carried on by the firm bind 
the firm and his partners unless: 
 
(i) The partner so acting has no authority to act for the firm in that matter; and 
 
(ii) The person with whom he is dealing knows that he has no authority; or 
 
(iii) Does not know or believe him to be a partner. 
Authority of a Partner 
The authority of a partner means the capacity of a partner to bind the firm by his act. This authority may be 
express or implied. 
(i) Express Authority: - Authority is said to be express when it is given by words, spoken or written. The firm 
is bound by all acts of a partner done within the scope of his express authority even if the acts are not within 
the scope of the partnership business. 
(ii) Implied Authority: - The implied authority of a partner is also known as ostensible or apparent authority, 
Sections 19 and 22 contain provisions regarding the scope of the implied authority of a partner. The implied 
authority is subject to the following conditions: 
 
(1) the act done must relate to the “normal business” of the firm; 
 
(2) the act must be done in the usual way; 
 
(3) the act must be done in the name of the firm. 
Implied Authority of a Partner 
Subject to the limitations mentioned above, every partner has an implied authority to bind the firm by the 
following acts: 
 
(i) By selling firm’s goods; 
 
(ii) By purchasing goods for the firm; 
 
(iii) By accepting any payment of debts due to the firm; and 
 
(iv) By engaging and discharging employees. 
In a Trading Firm (one which carries on business of buying and selling goods), a partner has the following 
additional powers: 
 
(i) To borrow money on the firm’s credit and to pledge the firm’s goods for that purpose; 
 
(ii) To accept, make and issue negotiable instruments in the firm’s name; and 
 
(iii) To employ a solicitor or attorney on behalf of the firm (Bank of Australasia v. Beriliat, (1847) 6 Moor, 
P.C. 152 at pp. 193-94). 
Acts beyond Implied Authority 
Section 19(2) states that in the absence of any usage or custom or trade to the contrary, the implied authority 
of a partner does not empower him to: 
 
(a) submit a dispute relating to the business of the firm to arbitration; 
                                                                       Lesson 23        Indian Partnership Act, 1932 
587 
 
(b) open a banking account on behalf of the firm in his own name; 
 
(c) compromise or relinquish any claim or portion of a claim by the firm; 
 
(d) withdraw a suit or proceeding filed on behalf of the firm; 
 
(e) admit any liability in a suit or proceedings against the firm; 
 
(f) acquire immovable property on behalf of the firm; 
 
(g) transfer immovable property belonging to the firm; and 
 
(h) enter into a partnership on behalf of the firm. 
Extent of Partners’ Liability 
It is, however, open to the partners by means of an express contract to extend or limit the implied authority, 
but third parties will be bound by such limitations only when they have notice of such curtailment. 
All partners are liable jointly and severally for all acts or omissions binding on the firm including liabilities 
arising from contracts as well as torts (Section 25). This is known as the liability of partners for the acts of the 
firm.  But in order that an act done may be an act of the firm and, therefore, binding on the firm, it is 
necessary that the partner doing the act on behalf of the firm must have done that act in the name of and on 
behalf of the firm and not in his personal capacity. And the act must have been done in the ordinary course 
of the business of the firm. [Sections 19(1) and 22] 
Liability of the Firm for Torts 
Every partner is liable for the negligence and fraud of the other partners in the course of the management of 
business. A partner charges the firm if he acts as an agent for it. The firm is similarly liable where a partner 
commits a tort with the authority of his co-partners. (Section 26) 
If a partner acting within the scope of his apparent authority receives the property of a third person and 
misapplies it, or if the firm in the course of its business receives the property of a third person and, while it is in 
the firm’s custody, a partner misapplies it, in each case the firm is liable to make good the loss. (Section 27) 
Liability of an Incoming Partner 
As a general rule, an incoming partner is not liable for the debts incurred before he joined the firm as a 
partner [Section 31(2)]. The incoming partner may, however, assume liability for past debts by novation, i.e., 
by a tripartite agreement between (i) the creditor of the firm, (ii) the partners existing at the time the debt was 
incurred, and (iii) the incoming partner. 
Liability of an Outgoing or Retiring Partner 
An outgoing partner remains liable for the partnership debts contracted while he was a partner. He may, 
however, be discharged by novation, i.e., by an agreement between himself, the new firm and the creditors. 
He may also continue to be liable after retirement if he allows himself to be held out as a partner, e.g. by 
allowing his name to remain the firm name. To protect himself from his liability, he should give express notice 
of his retirement to the persons who were dealing with the firm before his retirement or give public notice in 
the manner as laid down in Section 72 of the Act, that is to say, by publishing it in the Official Gazette and in 
at least one vernacular newspaper where the firm carries on the business. [Section 32(3)] 
Death or Insolvency 
The estate of a partner who dies, or who becomes insolvent, is not liable for partnership debts contracted after 
EP-EBCL 
588 
the date of the death or insolvency. It will, however, be liable for debts incurred before death or insolvency. 
(Sections 34 and 35) 
Dissolution 
According to Section 39 “The dissolution of partnership between all the partners of a firm” is called the 
“Dissolution of the Firm”. A dissolution does not necessarily follow because the partnership has ceased to do 
business, for the partnership may continue for the purpose of realising the assets. 
The Partnership Act makes a distinction between the “dissolution of partnership” and “dissolution of firm”. 
Where there is dissolution of partnership between all the partners of a firm, it is a dissolution of the firm 
(Section 39). Where there is an extinction of relationship between some of the partners only, it is a 
dissolution of partnership. So the dissolution of a partnership may or may not include the dissolution of the 
firm, but the dissolution of the firm necessarily means the dissolution of the partnership as well. 
Dissolution of Partnership 
The dissolution of partnership takes place (even when there is no dissolution of the firm) in the following 
circumstances: 
 
(a) By the expiry of the fixed term for which the partnership was formed.[Section 42(a)] 
 
(b) By the completion of the adventure. [Section 42(b)] 
 
(c) By the death of a partner. [Section 42(c)] 
 
(d) By the insolvency of a partner. [Section 42(d)] 
 
(e) By the retirement of a partner. [Section 42(e)] 
In all the above cases, the remaining partners may continue the firm in pursuance of an agreement to that 
effect. If they do not continue then the dissolution of the firm takes place automatically. 
Dissolution of the Firm 
In the following cases there is necessarily a breaking up or extinction of the relationship between all the 
partners of the firm, and closing up of the business: 
 
(a) By mutual agreement: A firm may be dissolved where all the partners agree that it shall be 
dissolved. (Section 40) 
 
(b) By the insolvency of all the partners but one: If all the partners except one become insolvent, the 
firm must come to an end, as a partnership firm with one partner cannot continue. [Section 41(a)] 
 
(c) By business becoming illegal: If the business of the firm becomes illegal because of some 
subsequent events, such as change of law, it is automatically or compulsorily dissolved by the 
operation of law. [Section 41(b)] 
 
(d) By notice of dissolution: Where the partnership is at will, the firm may be dissolved at any time, by 
any partner giving notice in writing of his intention to dissolve the firm, to all the other partners. The 
dissolution will take place from the date mentioned in the notice or, if no such date is mentioned, as 
from the date of the communication of the notice. (Section 43) 
Dissolution of the Firm through Court 
Unlike a partnership at will, the partnership for a fixed period cannot be dissolved by a notice. It could only be 
dissolved by Court in a suit by a partner. Though remedy of dissolution by a suit is available in case of all 
                                                                       Lesson 23        Indian Partnership Act, 1932 
589 
kinds of partnership, it is of practical importance in case of partnership for a fixed period. 
As per Section 44, the Court may order dissolution of the firm in the following circumstances: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a)  When a partner becomes of unsound mind: As the insanity of a partner does not automatically 
dissolve the firm, either the lunatic through his guardian or other partners  may file a suit for  the 
dissolution of the firm,  in either case the Court may order dissolution which will take effect from the 
date of the order. 
 
(b) Permanent incapacity of a partner: Where a partner has become permanently incapable of 
performing his duties as a partner, e.g., he becomes blind, paralytic, etc., the Court may, at the 
instance of any of the other partners, order the dissolution of the firm.  
 
(c) Misconduct of a partner affecting the business: Where a partner is guilty of misconduct, which is 
likely to affect prejudicially the business of the firm, the Court may dissolve the firm at the instance 
of any of the other partners. Gambling  by a partner or conviction of a partner for travelling without 
ticket would be sufficient ground for dissolution. 
 
(d) Persistent disregard of partnership agreement by a partner: Where a partner frequently commits 
breaches of the partnership agreement  and the other partners find it impossible to carry on the 
business, the Court may order dissolution at the instance  of the other partners. 
 
(e) Transfer of interest or share by a partner: A partner is not entitled to assign away his interest so as 
to introduce a new partner into the firm. Where a partner has transferred the whole of his interest to 
a third person or where his interest has been attached under a decree or sold under a process of 
law, the other partners may sue for dissolution.  
 
(f) Business working at a loss: The Court may dissolve a partnership firm where it is satisfied that the 
business of the firm cannot be carried on except at a loss. 
 
(g) Where just and equitable: As the grounds mentioned are not exhaustive, the Court may dissolve a 
EP-EBCL 
590 
firm on any other ground if it is satisfied that it would be just and equitable to dissolve the firm. The 
Court may order dissolution where the sub-stratum of the partnership firm has gone or where there 
is a complete deadlock and destruction of confidence between the partners [re. Yenidje Tobacco 
Co. Ltd. (1916) 2 Ch. 426]. 
Effect of Dissolution 
Continuing authority of partners 
The authority of partners to bind the firm continues so long as is necessary to wind up the business, provided 
that the firm is in no case bound by the acts of a partner who  has  been  adjudged  an insolvent  except  on  
the principle of holding out. (Section 47) 
Also each partner has an equitable lien over the firm’s assets entitling him to have them applied in payment 
of the firm’s debts, and in payment of whatever is due to partner. This lien can be enforced by injunction 
forbiding unfair distribution. (Section 46) 
Continuing liability of partners 
The partners continue to be liable to outsiders for any act done by any of them which would have been an 
act of the firm if done before the dissolution, unless a public notice is given of the dissolution. 
After dissolution, the rights and obligations of partners continue in all things necessary for the winding up of 
the business. The partners may complete unfinished transactions. But this authority is only for the winding up 
of the affairs of the firm and not for new transactions. 
Right to Return of Premium 
To buy entry into an existing firm, a new partner sometimes has to pay a premium to the existing partners in 
addition to any investment of capital. On dissolution, he is entitled to demand the return of a proportion of  the 
premium  if the partnership was for a fixed term and was dissolved before the expiry of that term, unless 
dissolution was caused by (i) agreement, or (ii) misconduct of the party seeking return of the premium, or (iii) 
death of a partner. (Section 51) 
Settlement of Accounts on Dissolution 
Section 48 of the Act provides that in settling accounts between the partners after a dissolution of 
partnership, the following rules shall, subject to any agreement, be observed: 
 
(a) Losses, including deficiencies of capital shall be paid first out of undistributed profits, next out of 
capital, and lastly, if necessary, by the partners individually in the proportion in which they were 
entitled to share profits 
 
(b) The assets of the firm, including the sums, contributed by the partners to make up losses or 
deficiencies of capital shall be applied in the following manner and order: 
 
(i) in paying outside creditors; 
 
(ii) in repaying advances made by partners (distinct from investment of capital); 
 
(iii) in repaying capital to partners; and  
 
(iv) the ultimate residue, if any, shall be divided among the partners in the proportions in which profits 
are divisible. 
Where the assets are not sufficient, the partners have to bear the loss in equal shares. After they have 
                                                                       Lesson 23        Indian Partnership Act, 1932 
591 
contributed their share of the deficiency they will be paid rateably the amount due to them by way of their 
capital (The Rule followed in the case of Garner v. Murray, 1904 73 L.J. Ch. 66). 
Loss due to insolvency of partners 
In case a partner is insolvent and is not able to contribute towards the deficiency, the principle laid down in the 
case of Garner vs. Murray will be applicable. 
It helds that: 
 
(a) The solvent partners will contribute only their share of deficiency in cash 
 
(b) The available assets should be distributed among the solvent partners in proportion to their capital. 
 
(c) Thus, the deficiency of capital of the insolvent partners will be distributed among the solvent 
partners in the ratio of their respective capitals. 
Goodwill 
This is a partnership asset and means the benefit arising from a firm’s business connections or reputation. “It is 
the advantage which is acquired by a business, beyond the mere value of the capital, stock fund and properly 
employed therein, in consequence of the general public patronage and encouragement which it receives from 
constant or habitual customers”. Though an intangible asset, it has value; and unless otherwise agreed  in  the 
partnership articles,  upon dissolution  it must be  sold  and the proceeds of sale distributed as capital. Where 
dissolution is caused by death, the estate of the deceased partner is entitled to share in the proceeds of the sale. 
If the goodwill is sold and there is no agreement as to its disposal, any partner can carry on the business, 
provided that by doing so he does not expose former partners to liability. But if by agreement the goodwill is 
assigned to any person, he can restrain partners as explained in the next para. 
Sale of Goodwill 
Where goodwill is sold, either to a partner or to an outsider, the value is divisible among the partners in the 
same manner as they share profits and losses, unless otherwise agreed. 
The rights of the buyer and seller of the goodwill are as follows: 
 
(a) Buyer’s rights: On the sale of goodwill the buyer may, unless the terms in the contract of sale 
provide otherwise: 
 
(i) represent himself in continuing the business, 
 
(ii) maintain his exclusive rights to the use of the firm name, and  
 
(iii) solicit former customers of the business and restrain the seller of the goodwill from doing so. 
 
(b) Seller’s rights: The vendors may enter into competition with the purchaser unless he is prevented by 
a valid restraint clause in the contract of sale. 
Registration of the Firm 
Section 56-71 deal with the registration of a firm and consequences of non-registration. 
Registration 
The registration of a firm may be effected at any time by sending by post or delivering to the Registrar of the 
area in which any place of business of the firm is situated or proposed  to be situated, a statement in the 
EP-EBCL 
592 
prescribed form and accompanied by the prescribed fee, stating: 
 
(a) the name of the firm; 
 
(b) the place or principal place of business of the firm; 
 
(c) the names of any other places where the firm carries on business; 
 
(d) the date when each partner joined the firm; 
 
(e) the names in full and permanent addresses of the partners; and  
 
(f) the duration of the firm. 
The statement shall be signed and verified by all the partners or by their agents specially authorised in this 
behalf. (Section 58) 
The Partnership Act, 1932, does not make registration of a firm compulsory but it introduces certain 
disabilities, which makes registration necessary at one time or other. An unregistered firm is not an illegal 
association. 
Effects of Non-registration 
The following are the effects of non-registration of a firm: 
 
1. Sub-section (1) of Section 69 places a bar on the right of the partners of a firm  to sue each other or 
the firm for enforcing any right arising from a contract or conferred by the Partnership Act, if the firm 
is not registered and the person suing is or has not been shown in the Register of Firms as a 
partner in the firm. 
 
2. Sub-section (2) of Section 69 places a bar on the institution of a suit by or on behalf of a firm against  
a third-party if the firm is not registered and the persons suing are or have not been shown in the 
Register of Firms as partners in the firm. 
 
3. There is no bar on the right of third-parties to sue the firm or any partner. 
 
 However, the Act allows the following suits: 
 
(a) A suit for the dissolution of a firm. 
 
(b) A suit for rendering of accounts of a dissolved firm. 
 
(c) A suit for realisation of the property of a dissolved firm. 
 
(d) A suit or claim of set-off, the value of which does not exceed one hundred rupees, 
 
(e) A proceeding in execution or other proceeding incidental to or arising from a suit or claim for not 
exceeding one hundred rupees in value. 
 
(f) A suit by a firm which has no place of business in the territories to which the Indian Partnership 
Act extends. 
 
(g) A suit for the realisation of the property of an insolvent partner. 
 
(h) A suit by a firm whose places of business are situated in areas which are exempted from the 
application of Chapter VII of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932. 
Section 69 bars the very institution of a suit by an unregistered firm or by its partners. Registration is a 
condition precedent to the right to institute the suit and, therefore, the condition precedent must first be 
fulfilled before the institution of the suit. If, therefore, on the date of the institution of a suit, the firm is not 
                                                                       Lesson 23        Indian Partnership Act, 1932 
593 
registered, the subsequent registration cannot validate the suit. The only option left to the Court is to dismiss 
the suit (Prithvi Singh v. Hasan Ali, (1950) Bom. L.R. 862). By virtue of this provision a partner of an 
unregistered firm cannot institute a suit to compel the other partner or partners to join in the registration of 
firm. The only remedy of such  a partner is to institute a suit for dissolution (Keshav Lal v. Chuni Lal, AIR 
1941 Rangoon 196). A suit by the firm is really a suit by all the partners who were its partners at the time of 
the accrual of the cause of action and, therefore, all must join in the institution of the suit. 
However, an unregistered firm can bring a suit to enforce a right arising otherwise than out of contract e.g., 
for an injunction against a person for wrongful infringement of trade mark etc. 
Specific Performance of Partnership Agreement 
It is not allowed. The working of a partnership depends upon the personal inclination of the partners, there 
can be no specific performance of a partnership agreement (Scott v. Raymont, 1868, 7 Fq. 112). 
Suit for Libel or Slander 
A firm is merely a collection of partners and cannot bring a suit for libel or slander. Libel or slander against a 
firm imply a libel or slander of its partners. Such partners themselves or any one may  file the suit for libel or 
slander (P.K. Oswal Hosiery Mills v. Tilak Chand, AIR 1969, Punj. 150). 
LESSON ROUND-UP 
• The Indian Partnership Act, 1932 lays down the important provisions relating to partnership contracts. 
• According to Section 4 “Partnership is the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of 
a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all. 
• A partnership may either be for a particular adventure or for a fixed period. It may also be a partnership at 
will. 
• The minor  is incompetent  to contract  and, therefore,  partnership cannot  come into  existence if  the 
parties to a contract of partnership consist of one major and one minor. 
• Every partner is an agent of the firm and of other partners for the purpose of the business of the firm. 
• The authority of a partner means the capacity of a partner to bind the firm by his act. This authority may be 
express or implied. 
• All partners are liable jointly and severally for all acts or omissions binding on the firm including liabilities 
arising from contracts as well as torts. 
• The dissolution of partnership between all the partners of a firm is called the “Dissolution of the Firm”. 
• A dissolution does not necessarily follow because the partnership has ceased to do business, for the 
partnership may continue for the purpose of realising the assets.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Sale Exchange of  goods  and  services  is  the basis  
of  every  business  activity.  Goods are bought and 
sold for cash as well as on credit. All these 
transactions require flow of cash either immediately 
or after a certain time. In modern business, large 
number of transactions involving huge sums of 
money 
takes 
place 
every 
day. 
It 
is 
quite   
inconvenient as well as risky for either party to make 
and receive payments in cash. Therefore, it is a 
common practice for business men to make use of 
certain documents as means of making payment. 
Some of these documents are called negotiable 
instruments. But on the other hand, accepting 
payment using negotiable instruments is no less than 
a risky transaction since it involves deferred 
payments. 
In the light of this, the Negotiable Instruments Act 
was passed in 1881. There is no doubt that the Act is 
to regulate commercial transactions and was drafted 
to suit requirements of business conditions prevailing 
then. 
This lesson deals with the common provisions of  the  
mentioned  act,  which  has  played  an important  
role  in  increasing  commercial activities. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
LESSON OUTLINE 
EP-EBCL 
596 
DEFINITION OF A NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT 
The law relating to negotiable instruments is contained in the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. It is an Act 
to define and amend the law relating to promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques. 
The Act does not affect the custom or local usage relating to an instrument in oriental language i.e., a Hundi. 
The term “negotiable instrument” means a document transferable from one person to another. However the 
Act has not defined the term. It merely says that “A negotiable instrument” means a promissory note, bill of 
exchange or cheque payable either to order or to bearer. [Section 13(1)] 
A negotiable instrument may be defined as “an instrument, the property in which is acquired by anyone who 
takes it bona fide, and for value, notwithstanding any defect of title in the person from whom he took it, from 
which it follows that an instrument cannot be negotiable unless it is such and in such a state that the true 
owner could transfer the contract or engagement contained therein by simple delivery of instrument” (Willis—
The Law of Negotiable Securities, Page 6). 
According to this definition the following are the conditions of negotiability: 
 
(i) The instrument should be freely transferable. An instrument cannot be negotiable unless it is such 
and in such state that the true owner could transfer by simple delivery or endorsement and delivery. 
 
(ii) The person who takes it for value and in good faith is not affected by the defect in the title of the 
transferor. 
 
(iii) Such a person can sue upon the instrument in his own name. 
Negotiability involves two elements namely, transferability free from equities and transferability by delivery or 
endorsement (Mookerjee J. In Tailors Priya v. Gulab Chand, AIR 1965 Cal). 
But the Act recognises only three types of instruments viz., a Promissory Note, a Bill of Exchange and a 
Cheque as negotiable instruments. However, it does not mean that other instruments are not negotiable 
instruments provided that they satisfy the following conditions of negotiability: 
 
1. The instrument should be freely transferable by the custom of trade. Transferability may be by (i) 
delivery or (ii) endorsement and delivery. 
 
2. The person who obtains it in good faith and for consideration gets it free from all defects and can 
sue upon it in his own name. 
 
3. The holder has the right to transfer.  The  negotiability  continues  till  the maturity. 
Effect of Negotiability 
The general principle of law relating to transfer of property is that no one can pass a better title than he 
himself has (nemodat quad non-habet). The exceptions to this general rule arise by virtue of statute or by a 
custom. A negotiable instrument is one such exception which is originally a creation of mercantile custom. 
Thus a bona fide transferee of negotiable instrument for consideration without notice of any defect of title, 
acquires the instrument free of any defect, i.e., he acquires a better title than that of the transferor. 
 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
597 
IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS OF NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS 
Following are the important characteristics of negotiable instruments: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Classification of Negotiable Instruments 
The negotiable instruments may be classified as under: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1) Bearer Instruments 
A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is payable to bearer when (i) it is expressed to be so payable, 
or (ii) the only or last endorsement on the instrument is an endorsement in blank. A person who is a holder of 
a bearer instrument can obtain the payment of the instrument. 
(2) Order Instruments 
A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is payable to order (i) which is expressed to be so payable; or 
(ii) which is expressed to be payable to a particular person, and does not contain any words prohibiting 
transfer or indicating an intention that it shall not be transferable. 
(3) Inland Instruments (Section 11) 
A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque drawn or made in India, and made payable, or drawn upon 
EP-EBCL 
598 
any person, resident in India shall be deemed to be an inland instrument. Since a promissory  note is not 
drawn on any person, an inland promissory  note is one which is made payable in India. Subject to this 
exception, an inland instrument is one which is either: 
 
(i) drawn and made payable in India, or 
 
(ii) drawn in India upon some persons resident therein, even though it is made payable in a foreign 
country. 
(4) Foreign Instruments 
An instrument which is not an inland instrument, is deemed to be a foreign instrument. The essentials of a 
foreign instrument include that: 
 
(i) it must be drawn outside India and made payable outside or inside India; or 
 
(ii) it must be drawn in India and made payable outside India and drawn on a person resident outside 
India. 
(5) Demand Instruments (Section 19) 
A promissory note or a bill of exchange in which no time for payment is specified is an instrument payable on 
demand. 
(6) Time Instruments 
Time instruments are those which are payable at sometime in the future. Therefore, a promissory note or a 
bill of exchange payable after a fixed period, or after sight, or on specified day, or on the happening of an 
event which is certain to happen, is known as a time instrument. The expression “after sight” in a promissory 
note means that the payment cannot be demanded on it unless it has been shown to the maker. In the case 
of bill of exchange, the expression “after sight” means after acceptance, or after noting for non-acceptance or 
after protest for non-acceptance. 
Ambiguous Instruments (Section 17) 
An instrument, which in form is such that it may either be treated by the holder as a bill or as a note, is an 
ambiguous instrument. Section 5(2) of the English Bills of Exchange Act provides that where in a bill, the 
drawer and the drawee are the same person or where the drawee is a fictitious person or a person 
incompetent to contract, the holder may treat the instrument, at his option, either as a bill of exchange or as a 
promissory note. 
Bill drawn to or to the order of the drawee or by an agent on his principal, or by one branch of a bank on 
another or by the direction of a company or their cashier are also ambiguous instruments. A promissory note 
addressed to a third person may be treated as a bill by such person by accepting it, while a bill not 
addressed to any one may be treated as a note. But where the drawer and payee are the same, e.g., where 
A draws a bill payable to A’s order, it is not an ambiguous instrument and cannot be treated as a promissory 
note. Once an instrument has been treated either as a bill or as a note, it cannot be treated differently 
afterwards. 
Inchoate or Incomplete Instrument (Section 20) 
When one person signs and delivers to another a paper stamped in accordance with the law relating to 
negotiable instruments, and either wholly blank or having written thereon an incomplete negotiable instrument, 
he thereby gives prima facie authority to the holder thereof to make or complete, as the case may be, upon it a 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
599 
negotiable instrument, for any amount specified therein, and not exceeding the amount, covered by the stamp. 
Such an instrument is called an inchoate instrument. The person so signing shall be liable upon such 
instrument, in the capacity in which he signs the same, to any holder in due course for such amount, provided 
that no person other than a holder in due course shall recover from the person delivering the instrument 
anything in excess of the amount intended by him to be paid thereon. 
The authority to fill up a blank or incomplete instrument may be exercised by any “holder” and not only the 
first holder to whom the instrument was delivered. The person signing and delivering the paper is liable both 
to a “holder” and a “holder-in-due- course”.  But there is a difference in their respective rights. A “holder” can 
recover only what the person signing and delivering the paper agreed to pay under the instrument, while a 
“holder-in- due-course” can recover the whole amount made payable by the instrument provided that it is 
covered by the stamp, even though the amount authorised was smaller. 
KINDS OF NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS 
The Act recognises only three kinds of negotiable instruments under Section 13 but it does not exclude any 
other negotiable instrument provided the instrument entitles a person to a sum of money and is transferable 
by delivery. Instruments written in oriental languages i.e. hundis are also negotiable instruments. These 
instruments are discussed below: 
(i)  Promissory Notes 
A “promissory note” is an instrument in writing (not being a bank note or a currency note) containing an 
unconditional undertaking, signed by the maker to pay a certain sum of money to, or to the order of, a certain 
person, or only to bearer of the instrument. (Section 4) 
Parties to a Promissory Note: 
A promissory note has the following parties: 
 
(a) The maker: the person who makes or executes the note promising to pay the amount stated therein. 
 
(b) The payee: one to whom the note is payable. 
 
(c) The holder: is either the payee or some other person to whom he may have endorsed the note. 
 
(d) The endorser. 
 
(e) The endorsee. 
Essentials of a Promissory Note: 
To be a promissory note, an instrument must possess the following essentials: 
 
(a) It must be in writing.  An oral promise to pay will not do. 
 
(b) It must contain an express promise or clear undertaking to pay. A promise to pay cannot be 
inferred. A mere acknowledgement of debt is not sufficient. If A writes to B “I owe you (I.O.U.) Rs. 
500", there is no promise to pay and the instrument is not a promissory note. 
 
(c) The promise or undertaking to pay must be unconditional. A promise to pay “when able”, or “as 
soon as possible”, or “after your marriage to D”, is conditional. But a promise to pay after a specific 
time or on the happening of an  event  which  must  happen,  is not conditional,  e.g.  “I promise to 
pay Rs. 1,000 ten days after the death of B”, is unconditional. 
 
(d) The maker must sign the promissory note in token of an undertaking to pay to the payee or his 
EP-EBCL 
600 
order. 
 
(e) The maker must be a certain person, i.e., the note must show clearly who is the person engaging 
himself to pay. 
 
(f) The payee must be certain. The promissory note must contain a promise to pay to some person or 
persons ascertained by name or designation or to their order. 
 
(g) The sum payable must be certain and the amount must not be capable of contingent additions or 
subtractions. If A promises to pay Rs. 100 and all other sums which shall become due to him, the 
instrument is not a promissory note. 
 
(h) Payment must be  in  legal money  of  the country.  Thus, a promise to pay Rs. 500 and deliver 10 
quintals of rice is not a promissory note. 
 
(i) It must be properly stamped in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Stamp Act. Each stamp 
must be duly cancelled by maker’s signature or initials. 
 
(j) It must contain the name of place, number and the date on which it is made. However, their 
omission will not render the instrument invalid, e.g. if it is undated, it is deemed to be dated on the 
date of delivery. 
 
 Note: A promissory note cannot be made payable or issued to bearer, no matter  whether  it is  
payable  on  demand  or  after  a certain time (Section 31 of the RBI Act). 
(ii) Bills of Exchange 
A “bill of exchange” is an instrument in writing containing an unconditional order, signed by the maker, 
directing a certain person to pay a certain sum of money only to or to the order of, a certain person or to the 
bearer of the instrument. (Section 5) 
The definition of a bill of exchange is very similar to that of a promissory note and for most of the cases the 
rules which apply to promissory notes are in general applicable to bills. There are however, certain important 
points of distinction between the two. 
Parties to bills of exchange 
The following are parties to a bill of exchange: 
 
(a) The Drawer: the person who draws the bill. 
 
(b) The Drawee: the person on whom the bill is drawn. 
 
(c) The Acceptor: one who accepts the bill. Generally, the drawee is the acceptor but a stranger may 
accept it on behalf of the drawee. 
 
(d) The payee: one to whom the sum stated in the bill is payable, either the drawer or any other person 
may be the payee. 
 
(e) The holder: is either the original payee or any other person to whom, the payee has endorsed the 
bill. In case of a bearer bill, the bearer is the holder. 
 
(f) The endorser: when the holder endorses the bill to any one else he becomes the endorser. 
 
(g) The endorsee: is the person to whom the bill is endorsed. 
 
(h) Drawee in case of need: Besides the above parties, another person called the “drawee in case of 
need”, may be introduced at the option of the drawer. The name of such a person may be inserted 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881

either by the drawer or by any endorser in order that resort may be had to him in case of need, i.e., 
when the bill is dishonoured by either non-acceptance or non-payment. 
 
(i) Acceptor for honour: Further, any person may voluntarily become a party to a bill as acceptor. A 
person, who on the refusal by the original drawee to accept the bill or to furnish better security, 
when demanded by the notary, accept the bill supra protest in order to safeguard the honour of the 
drawer or any endorser, is called the acceptor for honour. 
Essentials of a Bill of Exchange: 
 
(1) It must be in writing. 
 
(2) It must contain an unconditional order to pay money only and not merely a request. 
 
(3) It must be signed by the drawer. 
 
(4) The parties must be certain. 
 
(5) The sum payable must also be certain. 
 
(6) It must comply with other formalities e.g. stamps, date, etc. 
Distinction between Bill of Exchange and Promissory Note 
The following are the important points of distinction between a bill of exchange and a promissory note: 
 
(a) A promissory note is a two-party instrument, with a maker (debtor) and a payee (creditor). In a bill 
there are three parties—drawer, drawee and payee, though any two out of the three capacities may 
be filled by one and the same person. In a bill, the drawer is the maker who orders the drawee to 
pay the bill to a person called the payee or to his order. When the drawee accepts the bill he is 
called the acceptor. 
 
(b) A note cannot be made payable to the maker himself, while in a bill, the drawer and payee may be 
the same person. 
 
(c) A note contains an unconditional promise by the maker to pay to the payee or his order; in a bill 
there is an unconditional order to the drawee to pay according to the directions of the drawer. 
 
(d) A note is presented for payment without any prior acceptance by the maker. A bill payable after 
sight must be accepted by the drawee or someone else on his behalf before it can be presented for 
payment. 
 
(e) The liability of the maker of a pro-note is primary and absolute, but the liability of the drawer of a bill 
is secondary and conditional. 
 
(f) Foreign bill must be protested for dishonour but no such protest is necessary in the case of a note. 
 
(g) When a bill is dishonoured, due notice of dishonour is to be given by the holder to the drawer and 
the intermediate endorsee, but no such notice need to be given in the case of a note. 
 
(h) A bill can be drawn payable to bearer provided it is not payable on demand. A promissory note 
cannot be made payable to bearer, even if it is made payable otherwise than on demand. 
How Bill of Exchange Originates—Forms of Bills of Exchange 
Bills of exchange were originally used for payment of debts by traders residing in one country to another 
country with a view to avoid transmission of coin. Now-a-days they are used more as trade bills both in 
connection with domestic trade and foreign trade and are called inland bills and foreign bills respectively. 
EP-EBCL 
602 
Inland Bills (Sections 11 and 12) 
A bill of exchange is an inland instrument if it is (i) drawn or made and payable in India, or (ii) drawn in India 
upon any person who is a resident in India, even though it is made payable in a foreign country. But a 
promissory note to be an inland should be drawn and payable in India, as it has no drawee. 
Two essential conditions to make an inland instrument are: 
 
(1) the instrument must have been drawn or made in India; and 
 
(2) the instrument must be payable in India or the drawee must be in India. 
Examples: A bill drawn in India, payable in USA, upon a person in India is an inland instrument. A bill drawn 
in India and payable in India but drawn on a person in USA is also an inland instrument. 
Foreign Bills 
All bills which are not inland are deemed to be foreign bills. Normally foreign bills are drawn in sets of three 
copies. 
Trade Bill 
A bill drawn and accepted for a genuine trade transaction is termed as a trade bill. When a trader sells goods 
on credit, he may make use of a bill of exchange. Suppose A sells goods worth  Rs. 1,000 to B and allows him 
90 days time to pay  the price,  A will  draw  a  bill of exchange on B,  on the following terms:  “Ninety days after 
date pay A or order,  the sum of  one thousand rupees only for value received”.  A will sign the bill and then 
present it to B for acceptance. This is necessary because, until a bill is accepted by the drawee, nobody has 
either rights or obligations. If B agrees to obey the order of A, he will accept the bill by writing across its face the 
word “accepted” and signing his name underneath and then delivering the bill to the holder. B, the drawee, now 
becomes the acceptor of the bill and liable to its holders. Such a bill is a genuine trade bill. 
Accommodation Bill 
All bills are not genuine trade bills, as they are often drawn for accommodating a party. An accommodation 
bill is a bill in which a person lends or gives his name to oblige a friend or some person whom he knows or 
otherwise. In other words, a bill which is drawn, accepted or endorsed without consideration is called an 
accommodation bill. The party lending his name to oblige the other party is known as the accommodating or 
accommodation party, and the party so obliged is called the party accommodated. An accommodation party 
is not liable on the instrument to the party accommodated because as between them there was no 
consideration and the instrument was merely to help. But the accommodation party is liable to a holder for 
value, who takes the accommodation bill for value, though such holder may not be a holder in due course. 
Thus, A may be in need of money and approach his friends B and C who, instead of lending the money 
directly, propose to draw an “Accommodation Bill” in his favour in the following form: 
“Three months after date pay A or order, the sum of Rupees one thousand only”. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
B. 
To 
 
C. 
If the credit of B and C is good, this device enables A to get an advance of `1,000 from his banker at the 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
603 
commercial rate of discount. The real debtor in this case is not C, but A the payee who promises to 
reimburse C before the period of three months only. A is here the principal debtor and B and C are mere 
sureties. This inversion of liability affords a good definition of an accommodation bill: “If as between the 
original parties to the bill the one who should prima facie be principal is in fact the surety whether he be 
drawer, acceptor, or endorser, that bill is an accommodation bill”. 
Bills in Sets (Section 132 and 133) 
Foreign bills are usually drawn in sets to avoid  the danger of loss.  They are drawn in sets  of  three,  each 
of which is  called  “Via” and as  soon  as  any one of them is paid, the others become inoperative. All these 
parts form one bill and the drawer must sign and deliver all of them to the payee. The stamp is affixed only 
on one part and one part is required to be accepted. But if the drawer mistakenly accepts all the parts of the 
same bill, he will be liable on each part accepted as if it were a separate bill. 
Right to Duplicate Bill 
Where a bill of exchange has been lost before it was overdue, the person who was the holder to it may apply 
to the drawer, to give him another bill of the same tenor. It is only the holder who can ask for a duplicate bill, 
promissory note or cheque. 
Bank Draft 
A bill of exchange is also sometimes spoken of as a draft. It is called as a bank draft when a bill of exchange 
drawn by one bank on another bank, or by itself on its own branch, and is a negotiable instrument. It is very 
much like the cheque with three points of distinction between the two. A bank draft can be drawn only by a 
bank on another bank, usually its own branch. It cannot so easily be counter-manded. It cannot be made 
payable to bearer.

(iii) Cheques 
The Negotiable Instruments (Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2002 has broadened, the 
definition of cheque to include the electronic image of a truncated cheque and a cheque in the electronic 
form. Section 6 of the Act provides that a ‘cheque’ is a bill of exchange drawn on a specified banker and not 
EP-EBCL 
604 
expressed to be payable otherwise than on demand and it includes the electronic image of a truncated 
cheque and a cheque in the electronic form. 
Despite the amendment as is evident the basic definition of the cheque has been retained and the definition 
has only been enlarged to include cheques in the above form as well. 
As per explanation appended to the section, the expression: 
 
(i) ‘“a cheque in the electronic form” means a cheque drawn in electronic form by using any computer 
resource and signed in a secure system with digital signature (with or without biometrics signature) 
and asymmetric crypto system or with electronic signature, as the case may be; 
 
(ii) ‘a truncated cheque’ means a cheque which is truncated during the course of a clearing cycle, 
either by the clearing house or by the bank whether paying or receiving payment, immediately on 
generation of an electronic image for transmission, substituting the further physical movement of the 
cheque in writing. (Explanation I). 
The expression ‘clearing house’ means the clearing house managed by the Reserve Bank of India or a 
clearing house recognised as such by the Reserve Bank of India. (Explanation II). 
‘Explanation III. – For the purposes of this section, the expressions “asymmetric crypto system”, “computer 
resource”, “digital signature”, “electronic form” and “electronic signature” shall have the same meanings 
respectively assigned to them in the Information Technology Act, 2000.’ 
Simply stated, a cheque is a bill of exchange drawn on a bank payable always on demand. Thus, a cheque 
is a bill of exchange with two additional qualifications, namely: (i) it is always drawn on a banker, and (ii) it is 
always payable on demand. A cheque being a species of a bill of exchange, must satisfy all the requirements 
of a bill; it does not, however, require acceptance. 
Note: By virtue of Section 31 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, no bill of exchange or hundi can be made 
payable to bearer on demand and no promissory note or a bank draft can be made payable to bearer at all, 
whether on demand or after a specified time. Only a cheque can be payable to bearer on demand. 
Parties to a cheque 
The following are the parties to a cheque: 
 
(a) The drawer: The person who draws the cheque. 
 
(b) The drawee: The banker of the drawer on whom the cheque is drawn. 
 
(c), (d), (e) and (f) The payee, holder, endorser and endorsee: same as in the case of a bill. 
Essentials of a Cheque 
 
(1) It is always drawn on a banker. 
 
(2) It is always payable on demand. 
 
(3) It does not require acceptance. There is, however, a custom among banks to mark cheques as 
good for purposes of clearance. 
 
(4) A cheque can be drawn on bank where the drawer has an account. 
 
(5) Cheques may be payable to the drawer himself. It may be made payable to bearer on demand 
unlike a bill or a note. 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
605 
 
(6) The banker is liable only to the drawer. A holder has no remedy against the banker if a cheque is 
dishonoured. 
 
(7) A cheque is usually valid for fix months. However, it is not invalid if it is post dated or ante-dated. 
 
(8) No Stamp is required to be affixed on cheques. 
Distinction between Cheques and Bills of Exchange 
As a general rule, the provisions applicable to bills payable on demand apply to cheques, yet there are few 
points of distinction between the two, namely: 
 
(a) A cheque is a bill of exchange and always drawn on a banker, while a bill may be drawn on any 
one, including banker. 
 
(b) A cheque can only be drawn payable on demand, a bill may be drawn payable on demand, or on 
the expiry of a specified period after sight or date. 
 
(c) A bill payable after sight must be accepted before payment can be demanded, a cheque does not 
require acceptance and is intended for immediate payment. 
 
(d) A grace of 3 days is allowed in the case of time bills, while no grace is given in the case of a 
cheque, for payment. 
 
(e) The drawer of a bill is discharged, if it is not presented for payment, but the drawer of a cheque is 
discharged only if he suffers any damage by delay in presentment for payment. 
 
(f) Notice of the dishonour of a bill is necessary, but not in the case of a cheque. 
 
(g) The cheque being a revocable mandate, the authority may be revoked by countermanding payment, 
and is determined by notice of the customer’s death or insolvency. This is not so in the case of bill. 
 
(h) A cheque may be crossed, but not a bill. 
A cheque is a bill of exchange drawn on a specified banker and always payable on demand. A cheque is 
always drawn on a particular banker and is always payable on demand. Consequently, all cheques are bills 
of exchange but all bills are not cheques.

Banker 
A banker is one who does banking business. Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 defines 
banking as, “accepting for the purpose of lending or investment, of deposits of money from the public, 
repayable on demand or otherwise and withdrawable by cheque, draft or otherwise.”  This definition 
EP-EBCL 
606 
emphasises two points: (1) that the primary function of a banker consists of accepting of deposits for the 
purpose of lending or investing the same; (2) that the amount deposited is repayable to the depositor on 
demand or according to the agreement. The demand for repayment can be made through a cheque, draft or 
otherwise, and not merely by verbal order.  
Customer 
The term “customer” is neither defined in Indian nor in English statutes. The general opinion is that a 
customer is one who has an account with the bank or who utilises the services of the bank. 
The special features of the legal relationship between the banker and the customer may be termed as the 
obligations and rights of the banker. These are: 
 
1. Obligation to honour cheques of the customers. 
 
2. Obligation to collect cheques and drafts on behalf of the customers. 
 
3. Obligation to keep proper record of transactions with the customer. 
 
4. Obligation to comply with the express standing instructions of the customer. 
 
5. Obligation not to disclose the state of customer’s account to anyone else. 
 
6. Obligation to give reasonable notice to the customer, if the banker wishes to close the account. 
 
7. Right of lien over any goods and securities bailed to him for a general balance of account. 
 
8. Right of set off and right of appropriation. 
 
9. Right to claim incidental charges and interest as per rules and regulations of the bank, as 
communicated to the customer  at  the time of opening the account. 
Liability of a Banker 
By opening a current account of a customer, the banker becomes liable to his debtor to the extent of the 
amount so received in the said account and undertakes to honour the cheques drawn by the customer so 
long as he holds sufficient funds to the customer’s credit. If a banker, without justification, fails to honour his 
customer’s cheques, he is liable to compensate the drawer for any loss or damage suffered by him. But the 
payee or holder of the cheque has no cause of action against the banker as the obligation to honour a 
cheque is only towards the drawer. 
The banker must also maintain proper and accurate accounts of credits and debits.  He must honour a 
cheque presented in due course.  But in the following circumstances, he must refuse to honour a cheque and 
in some others he may do so. 
When Banker must Refuse Payment 
In the following cases the authority of the banker to honour customer’s cheque comes to an end, he must 
refuse to honour cheques issued by the customer: 
 
(a) When a customer countermands payment i.e., where or when a customer, after issuing a cheque 
issues instructions not to honour it, the banker must not pay it. 
 
(b) When the banker receives notice of customer’s death. 
 
(c) When customer has been adjudged an insolvent. 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
607 
 
(d) When the banker receives notice of customer’s insanity. 
 
(e) When an order (e.g., Garnishee Order) of the Court, prohibits payment. 
 
(f) When the customer has given notice of assignment of the credit balance of his account. 
 
(g) When the holder’s title is defective and the banker comes to know of it. 
 
(h) When the customer has given notice for closing his account. 
When Banker may Refuse Payment 
In the following cases the banker may refuse to pay a customer’s cheque: 
 
(a) When the cheque is post-dated. 
 
(b) When the banker has no sufficient funds of the drawer with him and there is no communication 
between the bank and the customer to honour the cheque. 
 
(c) When the cheque is of doubtful legality. 
 
(d) When the cheque is not duly presented, e.g., it is presented after banking hours. 
 
(e) When the cheque on the face of it is irregular, ambiguous or otherwise materially altered. 
 
(f) When the cheque is presented at a branch where the customer has no account. 
 
(g) When some persons have joint account and the cheque is not signed jointly by all or by the 
survivors of them. 
 
(h) When the cheque has been allowed to become stale, i.e., it has not been presented within six 
months of the date mentioned on it. 
Protection of Paying Banker (Sections 10, 85 and 128) 
Section 85 lays down that where a cheque payable to order purports to be endorsed by or on behalf of the 
payee the banker is discharged by payment in due course. He can debit the account of the customer with the 
amount even though the endorsement turns out subsequently to have been forged, or the agent of the payee 
without authority endorsed it on behalf of the payee. It would be seen that the payee includes endorsee. This 
protection is granted because a banker cannot be expected to know the signatures of all the persons in the 
world. He is only bound to know the signatures of his own customers. 
Therefore, the forgery of drawer’s signature will not ordinarily protect the banker but even in this case, the 
banker may debit the account of the customer, if it can show that the forgery was intimately connected with 
the negligence of the customer and was the proximate cause of loss. 
In the case of bearer cheques, the rule is that once a bearer cheque, always a bearer cheque. Where, 
therefore, a cheque originally expressed by the drawer himself to be payable to bearer, the banker may 
ignore any endorsement on the cheque. He will be discharged by payment in due course. But a cheque 
which becomes bearer by a subsequent endorsement in blank is not covered by this Section. A banker is 
discharged from liability on a crossed cheque if he makes payment in due course. 
Payment in due Course (Section 10) 
Any person liable to make payment under a negotiable instrument, must make the payment of the amount 
due thereunder in due course in order to obtain a valid discharge against the holder. 
A payment in due course means a payment in accordance with the apparent tenor of the instrument, in good 
EP-EBCL 
608 
faith and without negligence to any person in possession thereof. 
A payment will be a payment in due course if: 
 
(a) it is in accordance with the apparent tenor of the instrument, i.e., according to what appears on the 
face of the instrument to be the intention of the parties; 
 
(b) it is made in good faith and without negligence, and under circumstances which do not afford a 
ground for believing that the person to whom it is made is not entitled to receive the amount; 
 
(c) it is made to the person in possession of the instrument who is entitled as holder to receive 
payment; 
 
(d) payment is made under circumstances which do not afford a reasonable ground believing that he is 
not entitled to receive payment of the amount mentioned in the instrument; and 
 
(e) payment is made in money and money only. 
Under Sections 10 and 128, a paying banker making payment in due course is protected. 
Collecting Banker 
Collecting Banker is one who collects the proceeds of a cheque for a customer. Although a banker collects 
the proceeds of a cheque for a customer purely as a matter of service, yet the Negotiable Instruments Act, 
1881 indirectly imposes statutory obligation, statutory in nature. This is evident from Section 126 of the Act 
which provides that a cheque bearing a “general crossing” shall not be paid to anyone other than banker and 
a cheque which is “specially crossed” shall not be paid to a person other than the banker to whom it is 
crossed. Thus, a paying banker must pay a generally crossed cheque only to a banker thereby meaning that 
it should be collected by another banker. While so collecting the cheques for a customer, it is quite possible 
that the banker collects for a customer, proceeds of a cheque to which the customer had no title in fact. In 
such cases, the true owner may sue the collecting banker for “conversion”. At the same time, it cannot be 
expected of a banker to know or to ensure that all the signatures appearing in endorsements on the reverse 
of the cheque are genuine. The banker is expected to be conversant only with the signatures of his 
customer. A customer to whom a cheque has been endorsed, would request his banker to collect a cheque. 
In the event of the endorser’s signature being proved to be forged at later date, the banker who collected the 
proceeds should not be held liable for the simple reason that he has merely collected the proceeds of a 
cheque. Section 131 of the Negotiable Instruments Act affords statutory protection in such a case where the 
customer’s title to the cheque which the banker has collected has been questioned. It reads as follows: 
“A banker who has in good faith and without negligence received payment for a customer of a cheque 
crossed generally or specially to himself shall not, in case the title to the cheque proves defective, incur any 
liability to the true owner of the cheque by reason of only having received such payment. 
Explanation: A banker receives payment of a crossed cheque for a customer within the meaning of this 
section notwithstanding that he credits his customer’s account with the amount of the cheque before 
receiving payment thereof." 
The Amendment Act, 2002 has added a new explanation to Section 131 which provides that it shall be the duty 
of the banker who receives payment based on an electronic image of a truncated cheque held with him, to 
verify the prima facie genuineness of the cheque to be truncated and any fraud, forgery or tampering apparent 
on the face of the instrument that can be verified with due diligence and ordinary care. (Explanation II) 
The requisites of claiming protection under Section 131 are as follows: 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
609 
 
(i) The collecting banker should have acted in good faith and without negligence. An act is done in 
good faith when it is done honestly. The plea of good faith can be rebutted on the ground of 
recklessness indicative of want of proper care and attention. Therefore, much depends upon the 
facts of the case. The burden of proving that the cheque was collected in good faith and without 
negligence is upon the banker claiming protection. Failure to verify the regularity of endorsements, 
collecting a cheque payable to the account of the company to the credit of the director, etc. are 
examples of negligence. 
 
(ii) The banker should have collected a crossed cheque, i.e., the cheque should have been crossed 
before it came to him for collection. 
 
(iii) The proceeds should have been collected for a customer, i.e., a person who has an account with 
him. 
 
(iv) That the collecting banker has only acted as an agent of the customer. If he had become the holder 
for value, the protection available under Section 131 is forfeited—Where for instance, the banker 
allows the customer to withdraw the amount of the cheque before the cheque is collected or where 
the cheque has been accepted in specific reduction of an overdraft, the banker is deemed to have 
become the holder for value and the protection is lost. But the explanation to Section 131 says that 
the mere crediting of the amount to the account does not imply that the banker has  become  a 
holder for value because due to accounting conveniences the banker may credit the account of the 
cheque to the customer’s account even before proceeds thereof are realised. 
Overdue, Stale or Out-of-date Cheques 
A cheque is overdue or becomes statute-barred after three years from its due date of issue. A holder cannot 
sue on the cheque after that time. Apart from this provision, the holder of a cheque is required to present it 
for payment within a reasonable time, as a cheque is not meant for indefinite circulation. In India, a cheque, 
which has been in circulation for more than six months, is regarded by bankers as stale. If, as a result of any 
delay in presenting a cheque, the drawer suffers any loss, as by the failure of the bank, the drawer is 
discharged from liability to the holder to the extent of the damage. 
Liability of Endorser 
In order to charge an endorser, it is necessary to present the cheque for payment within a reasonable time of 
its delivery by such endorser. ‘A’ endorses and delivers a cheque to B, and B keeps it for an unreasonable 
length of time, and then endorses and delivers it to C. C presents it for payment within a reasonable time 
after its receipt by him, and it is dishonoured. C can enforce payment against B but not against A, as qua A, 
the cheque has become stale. 
Rights of Holder against Banker 
A banker is liable to his customer for wrongful dishonour of his cheque but it is not liable to the payee or 
holder of the cheque. The holder has no right to enforce payment from the banker except in two cases, 
namely, (i) where the holder does not present the cheque within a reasonable time after issue, and as a 
result the drawer suffers damage by the failure of the banker in liquidation proceedings; and (ii) where a 
banker pays a crossed cheque by mistake over the counter, he is liable to the owner for any loss occasioned 
by it. 
Crossing of Cheques 
A cheque is either “open” or “crossed”. An open cheque can be presented by the payee to the paying banker 
and is paid over the counter. A crossed cheque cannot be paid across the counter but must be collected 
through a banker. 
EP-EBCL 
610 
A crossing is a direction to the  paying  banker  to  pay  the  money generally to a banker or to a particular 
banker, and not to pay otherwise. The object of crossing is  to  secure  payment  to  a  banker  so  that  it  
could be  traced to the person receiving the amount of the cheque. Crossing is a direction to the paying 
banker that the cheque should be paid only to a banker or a specified banker. To restrain negotiability, 
addition of words “Not Negotiable” or “Account Payee Only” is necessary. A crossed bearer cheque can be 
negotiated by delivery and crossed order cheque by endorsement and delivery. Crossing affords security 
and protection to the holder of the cheque. 
Modes of Crossing (Sections 123-131A) 
There are two types of crossing which may be used on cheque, namely: (i) General, and (ii) Special. To 
these may be added another type, i.e. Restrictive crossing. 
It is general crossing where a cheque bears across its face an addition of two parallel transverse lines and/or 
the addition of the words “and Co.” between them, or addition of “not negotiable”. As stated earlier, where a 
cheque is crossed generally, the paying banker will pay to any banker. Two transverse parallel lines are 
essential for a general crossing (Sections 123-126). 
In case of general crossing, the holder or payee cannot get the payment over the counter of the bank but 
through a bank only. The addition of the words “and Co.” do not have any significance but the addition of the 
words “not negotiable” restrict the negotiability of the cheque and in case of transfer, the transferee will not 
give a better title than that of a transferor. 
Where a cheque bears across its face an addition of the name of a banker, either with or without the words 
“not negotiable” that addition constitutes a crossing and the cheque is crossed specially and to that banker. 
The paying banker will pay only to the banker whose name appears across the cheque, or to his collecting 
agent. Parallel transverse lines are not essential but the name of the banker is the insignia of a special 
crossing. 
In case of special crossing, the paying banker is to honour the cheque only when it is prescribed through the 
bank mentioned in the crossing or it’s agent bank. 
Account Payee’s Crossing: Such crossing does, in practice, restrict negotiability of a cheque. It warns the 
collecting banker that the proceeds are to be credited only to the account of the payee, or the party named, 
or his agent. If the collecting banker allows the proceeds of a cheque bearing such crossing to be credited to 
any other account, he will be guilty of negligence and will not be entitled to the protection given to collecting 
banker under Section 131.  Such crossing does not affect the paying banker, who is under no duty to 
ascertain that the cheque is in fact collected for the account of the person named as payee. 
Not Negotiable Crossing 
A cheque may be crossed not negotiable by writing across the face of the cheque the words “Not Negotiable” 
within two transverse parallel lines in the case of a general crossing or alongwith the name of a banker in the 
case of a special crossing. Section 130 of the Negotiable Instruments Act provides “A person taking a 
cheque crossed generally or specially bearing in either case with the words ”not negotiable" shall not have 
and shall not be capable of giving, a better title to the cheque than that which the person from whom he took 
it had". The crossing of cheque “not negotiable” does not mean that it is non-transferable. It only deprives the 
instrument of the incident of negotiability. Normally speaking, the essential feature of a negotiable instrument 
as opposed to chattels is that a person who takes the instrument in good faith, without negligence, for value, 
before maturity and without knowledge of the defect in the title of the transferor, gets a good title to the 
instrument. In other words, he is called a holder in due course who acquires an indisputable title to the 
cheque. (When the instrument passes through a holder-in-due course, it is purged of all defects and the 
subsequent holders also get good title). It is exactly this important feature which is taken away by crossing 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
611 
the cheque “not negotiable”. In other words, a cheque crossed “not negotiable” is like any other chattel and 
therefore the transferee gets same title to the cheque which his transferor had.  That is to say that the 
transferee cannot claim the rights of a holder-in-due-course. So long as the title of the transferors is good, 
the title of the transferees is also good but if there is a taint in the title to the cheque of one of the endorsers, 
then all the subsequent transferees’ title also become tainted with the same defect they cannot claim to be 
holders-in-due-course. 
The object of this Section is to afford protection to the drawer or holder of a cheque who is desirous of 
transmitting it to another person, as much protection as can reasonably be afforded to him against 
dishonestly or actual miscarriage in the course of transit. For example, a cheque payable to bearer is 
crossed generally and is marked “not negotiable”. It is lost or stolen and comes into the possession of X who 
takes it in good faith and gives value for it, X collects the cheque through his bank and paying banker also 
pays. In this case, both the paying and the collecting bankers are protected under Sections 128 and 131 
respectively. But X cannot claim that he is a holder-in-due course which he could have under the normal 
circumstances claimed. The reason is that cheque is crossed “not negotiable” and hence the true owner’s 
(holder’s) right supercedes the rights of the holder-in-due-course. Since X obtained the cheque from a 
person who had no title to the cheque (i.e. from one whose title was defective) X can claim no better title 
solely because the cheque was crossed “not negotiable” and not for any other reason. Thus “not negotiable” 
crossing not only protects the rights of the true owner of the cheque but also serves as a warning to the 
endorsees’ to enquire thoroughly before taking the cheque as they may have to be answerable to the true 
owner thereof if the endorser’s title is found to be defective. 
“Not negotiable” restricts the negotiability of the cheque and in case of transfer, the transferee will not get a 
better title than that of a transferor. 
If the cheque becomes “not negotiable” it lacks negotiability. A cheque crossed specially or generally bearing 
the words “not negotiable”, lacks negotiability and therefore is not a negotiable instrument in the true sense. 
It does not restrict transferability but restricts negotiability only.

Maturity 
Cheques are always payable on demand but other instruments like bills, notes, etc. may be made payable 
on a specified date or after the specified period of time. The date on which payment of an instrument falls 
due is called its maturity. According to Section 22 of the Act, “the maturity of a promissory note or a bill of 
exchange is the date at which it falls due”. According to Section 21 a promissory note or bill of exchange 
payable “at sight” or “on presentment” is payable on demand. It is due for payment as soon as it is issued. 
The question of maturity, therefore, arises only in the case of a promissory note or a bill of exchange payable 
“after date” or “after sight” or at a certain period after the happening of an event which is certain to happen. 
Maturity is the date on which the payment of an instrument falls due. Every instrument payable at a specified 
period after date or after sight is entitled to three days of grace. Such a bill or note matures or falls due on 
the last day of the grace period, and must be presented for payment on that day and if dishonoured, suit can 
be instituted on the next day after maturity. If an instrument is payable by instalments, each instalment is 
entitled to three days of grace. No days of grace are allowed for cheques, as they are payable on demand. 
Where a note or bill is expressed to be payable on the expiry of specified number of months after sight, or 
after date, the period of payment terminates on the day of the month which corresponds with the date of 
instrument, or with the date of acceptance if the bill be accepted or presented for sight, or noted or protested 
for non-acceptance. If the month in which the period would terminate has no corresponding day, the period 
shall be held to terminate on the last day of such month. 
Illustrations 
 
(i) A negotiable instrument dated 31st January, 2001, is made payable at one months after date. The 
instrument is at maturity on the third day after the 28th February, 2001, i.e. on 3rd March, 2001. 
 
(ii) A negotiable instrument dated 30th August, 2001, is made payable three months after date. The 
instrument is at maturity on 3rd December, 2001. 
 
(iii) A negotiable instrument dated the 31st August, 2001, is made payable three months after date. The 
instrument is at maturity on 3rd December, 2001. 
If the day of maturity falls on a public holiday, the instrument is payable on the preceeding business day. 
Thus, if a bill is at maturity on a Sunday. It will be deemed due on Saturday and not on Monday. 
The ascertainment of the date of maturity becomes important because all these instruments must be 
presented for payment on the last day of grace and their payment cannot be demanded before that date. 
Where an instrument is payable by instalments, it must be presented for payment on the third day after the 
day fixed for the payment of each instalment. 
Holder 
According to Section 8 of the Act a person is a holder of a negotiable instrument who is entitled in his own 
name (i) to the possession of the instrument, and (ii) to recover or receive its amount from the parties 
thereto. It is not every person in possession of the instrument who is called a holder. To be a holder, the 
person must be named in the instrument as the payee, or the endorsee, or he must be the bearer thereof. A 
person who has obtained possession of an instrument by theft, or under a forged endorsement, is not a 
holder, as he is not entitled to recover the instrument. The holder implies de jure (holder in law) holder and 
not de facto (holder in fact) holder. An agent holding an instrument for his principal is not a holder although 
he may receive its payment. 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
613 
Holder in Due Course 
Section 9 states that a holder in due course is (i) a person who for consideration, obtains possession of a 
negotiable instrument if payable to bearer, or (ii) the payee or endorsee thereof, if payable to order, before its 
maturity and without having sufficient cause to believe that any defect existed in the title of the person from 
whom he derived his title. 
In order to be a holder in due course, a person must satisfy the following conditions: 
 
(i) He must be the holder of the instrument. 
 
(ii) He should have obtained the instrument for value or consideration. 
 
(iii) He must have obtained the negotiable instrument before maturity. 
 
(iv) The instrument should be complete and regular on the face of it. 
 
(v) The holder should take the instrument in good faith. 
A holder in due course is in a privileged position. He is not only himself protected against all defects of the 
persons from whom he received the instrument as current coin, but also serves as a channel to protect all 
subsequent holders. A holder in due course can recover the amount of the instrument from all previous 
parties, although, as a matter of fact, no consideration was paid by some of the previous parties to the 
instrument or there was a defect of title in the party from whom he took it. Once an instrument passes 
through the hands of a holder in due course, it is purged of all defects. It is like current coin. Whoever takes it 
can recover the amount from all parties previous to such holder. 
Capacity of Parties 
Capacity to incur liability as a party to a negotiable instrument is co-extensive with capacity to contract. 
According to Section 26, every person capable of contracting according to law to which he is subject, may 
bind himself and be bound by making, drawing, acceptance, endorsement, delivery and negotiation of a 
promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque. 
Negatively, minors, lunatics, idiots, drunken person and persons otherwise disqualified by their personal law, 
do not incur any liability as parties to negotiable instruments. But incapacity of one or more of the parties to a 
negotiable instrument in no way, diminishes the abilities and the liabilities of the competent parties. Where a 
minor is the endorser or payee of an instrument which has been endorsed all the parties accepting the minor 
are liable in the event of its dishonour. 
Liability of Parties 
The provisions regarding the liability of parties to negotiable instruments are laid down in Sections 30 to 32 
and 35 to 42 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. These provisions are as follows: 
1. Liability of Drawer (Section 30) 
The drawer of a bill of exchange or cheque is bound, in case of dishonour by the drawee or acceptor thereof, 
to compensate the holder, provided due notice of dishonour has been given to or received by the drawer. 
The nature of drawer’s liability is that by drawing a bill, he undertakes that (i) on due presentation, it shall be 
accepted and paid according to its tenor, and (ii) in case of dishonour, he will compensate the holder or any 
endorser, provided notice of dishonour has been duly given. However, in case of accommodation bill no 
notice of dishonour to the drawer is required. 
EP-EBCL 
614 
The liability of a drawer of a bill of exchange is secondary and arises only on default of the drawee, who is 
primarily liable to make payment of the negotiable instrument. 
2. Liability of the Drawee of Cheque (Section 31) 
The drawee of a cheque having sufficient funds of the drawer in his hands properly applicable to the 
payment of such cheque must pay the cheque when duly required to do so and, or in default of such 
payment, he shall compensate the drawer for any loss or damage caused by such default. 
As a cheque is a bill of exchange, drawn on a specified banker, the drawee of a cheque must always be a 
banker. The banker, therefore, is bound to pay the cheque of the drawer, i.e., customer, if the following 
conditions are satisfied: 
 
(i) The banker has sufficient funds to the credit of customer’s account. 
 
(ii) The funds are properly applicable to the payment of such cheque, e.g., the funds are not under any 
kind of lien etc. 
 
(iii) The cheque is duly required to be paid, during banking hours and on or after the date on which it is 
made payable. 
If the banker is unjustified in refusing to honour the cheque of its customer, it shall be liable for damages. 
3. Liability of “Maker” of Note and “Acceptor” of Bill (Section 32) 
In the absence of a contract to the contrary, the maker of a promissory note and the acceptor before maturity 
of a bill of exchange are bound to pay the amount thereof at maturity, according to the apparent tenor of the 
note or acceptance respectively. The acceptor of a bill of exchange at or after maturity is bound to pay the 
amount thereof to the holder on demand. 
It follows that the liability of the acceptor of a bill corresponds to that of the maker of a note and is absolute 
and unconditional but the liability under this Section is subject to a contract to the contrary (e.g., as in the 
case of accommodation bills) and may be excluded or modified by a collateral agreement. Further, the 
payment must be made to the party named in the instrument and not to any-one else, and it must be made at 
maturity and not before. 
4. Liability of endorser (Section 35) 
Every endorser incurs liability to the parties that are subsequent to him. Whoever endorses and delivers a 
negotiable instrument before maturity is bound thereby to every subsequent holder in case of dishonour of the 
instrument by the drawee, acceptor or maker, to compensate such holder of any loss or damage caused to him by 
such dishonour provided (i) there is no contract to the contrary; (ii) he (endorser) has not expressly excluded, 
limited or made conditional his own liability; and (iii) due notice of dishonour has been given to, or received by, 
such endorser. Every endorser after dishonour, is liable upon the instrument as if it is payable on demand. 
He is bound by his endorsement notwithstanding any previous alteration of the instrument. (Section 88) 
5. Liability of Prior Parties (Section 36) 
Every prior party to a negotiable instrument is liable thereon to a holder in due course until the instrument is 
duly satisfied. Prior parties may include the maker or drawer, the acceptor and all the intervening endorsers 
to a negotiable instrument. The liability of the prior parties to a holder in due course is joint and several. The 
holder in due course may hold any or all prior parties liable for the amount of the dishonoured instrument. 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
615 
6. Liability inter se 
Various parties to a negotiable instrument who are liable thereon stand on a different footing with respect to 
the nature of liability of each one of them. 
7. Liability of Acceptor of Forged Endorsement (Section 41) 
An acceptor of a bill of exchange already endorsed is not relieved from liability by reason that such 
endorsement is forged, if he knew or had reason to believe the endorsement to be forged when he accepted 
the bill. 
8. Acceptor’s Liability on a Bill drawn in a Fictitious Name 
An acceptor of a bill of exchange drawn in a fictitious name and payable to the drawer’s order is not, by 
reason that such name is fictitious, relieved from liability to any holder in due course claiming under an 
endorsement by the same hand as the drawer’s signature, and purporting to be made by the drawer. 
Negotiation (Section 14) 
A negotiable instrument may be transferred by negotiation or assignment. Negotiation is the transfer of an 
instrument (a note, bill or cheque) for one person to another in such a manner as to convey title and to 
constitute the transferee the holder thereof.  When a negotiable instrument is transferred by negotiation, the 
rights of the transferee may rise higher than those of the transferor, depending upon the circumstances 
attending the negotiation. When the transfer is made by assignment, the assignee has only those rights 
which the assignor possessed. In case of assignment, there is a transfer of ownership by means of a written 
and registered document. 
Negotiability and Assignability Distinguished 
A transfer by negotiation differs from transfer by assignment in the following respects: 
 
(a) Negotiation requires mere delivery of a bearer instrument and endorsement and delivery of an order 
instrument to effectuate a transfer. Assignment requires a written document signed by the 
transferor. 
 
(b) Notice of transfer of debt (actionable claim) must be given by the assignee to the debtor in order to 
complete his title; no such notice is necessary in a transfer by negotiation. 
 
(c) On assignment, the transferee of an actionable claim takes it subject to all the defects in the title of, 
and subject to all the equities and defences available against the assignor, even though he took the 
assignment for value and in good faith. In case of negotiation the transferee, as holder-in-due 
course, takes the instrument free from any defects in the title of the transferor. 
Importance of Delivery 
Negotiation is effected by mere delivery of a bearer instrument and by endorsement and delivery of an order 
instrument. This shows that “delivery” is essential in negotiable instruments. Section 46 expressly provides 
that making acceptance or endorsement of negotiable instrument is not complete until delivery, actual or 
constructive, of the instrument. Delivery made voluntarily with the intention of passing property in the 
instrument to the person to whom it is given is essential. 
Negotiation by Mere Delivery 
A bill or cheque payable to bearer is negotiated by mere delivery of the instrument. An instrument is payable 
EP-EBCL 
616 
to bearer: 
 
(i) Where it is made so payable, or 
 
(ii) Where it is originally made payable to order but the only or the last endorsement is in blank. 
 
(iii) Where the payee is a fictitious or a non-existing person. 
These instruments do not require signature of the transferor. The person who takes them is a holder, and 
can sue in his own name on them. Where a bearer negotiates an instrument by mere delivery, and does not 
put his signature thereon, he is not liable to any party to the instrument in case the instrument is 
dishonoured, as he has not lent his credit to it. His obligations are only towards his immediate transferee and 
to no other holders. 
A cheque, originally drawn payable to bearer remains bearer, even though it is subsequently endorsed in full. 
The rule is once a bearer cheque always a bearer cheque. 
Negotiation by Endorsement and Delivery 
An instrument payable to a specified person or to the order of a specified person or to a specified person or 
order is an instrument payable to order. Such an instrument can be negotiated only by endorsement and 
delivery. Unless the holder signs his endorsement on the instrument, the transferee does not become a 
holder. Where an instrument payable to order is delivered without endorsement, it is merely assigned and 
not negotiated and the holder thereof is not entitled to the rights of a holder in due course, and he cannot 
negotiate it to a third person. 
Endorsement (Sections 15 and 16) 
Where the maker or holder of a negotiable instrument signs the same otherwise than as such maker for the 
purpose of negotiation, on the back or face thereof or on a slip of paper annexed thereto (called Allonge), or 
so, signs for the same purpose, a stamped paper intended to be completed as a negotiable instrument, he is 
said to endorse the same (Section 15), the person to whom the instrument is endorsed is called the 
endorsee. 
In other words, ‘endorsement’ means and involves the writing of something on the back of an instrument for 
the purpose of transferring the right, title and interest therein to some other person. 
Classes of endorsement 
An endorsement may be (a) Blank or General, (b) Special or Full, (c) Restrictive, or (d) Partial, and (e) 
Conditional or Qualified. 
 
(a) Blank or General: An endorsement is to be blank or general where the endorser merely writes his 
signature on the back of the instrument, and the instrument so endorsed becomes payable to 
bearer, even though originally it was payable to order. Thus, where bill is payable to “Mohan or 
order”, and he writes on its back “Mohan”, it is an endorsement in blank by Mohan and the property 
in the bill can pass by mere delivery, as long as the endorsement continues to be a blank. But a 
holder of an instrument endorsed in blank may convert the endorsement in blank into an 
endorsement in full, by writing above the endorser’s signature, a direction to pay the instrument to 
another person or his order. 
 
(b) Special or Full: If the endorser signs his name and adds a direction to pay the amount mentioned in 
the instrument to, or to the order of a specified person, the endorsement is said to be special or in 
full. A bill made payable to Mohan or Mohan or order, and endorsed “pay to the order of Sohan” 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
617 
would be specially endorsed and Sohan endorses it further. A blank endorsement can be turned 
into a special one by the addition of an order making the bill payable to the transferee. 
 
(c) Restrictive: An endorsement is restrictive which prohibits or restricts the further negotiation of an 
instrument. Examples of restrictive endorsement: “Pay A only” or “Pay A for my use” or “Pay A on 
account of B” or “Pay A or order for collection”. 
 
(d) Partial: An endorsement partial is one which purports to transfer to the endorsee a part only of the 
amount payable on the instrument. A partial endorsement does not operate as negotiation of the 
instrument. A holds a bill for Rs. 1,000 and endorses it as “Pay B or order Rs. 500". The 
endorsement is partial and invalid. 
 
(e) Conditional or qualified: An endorsement is conditional or qualified which limits or negatives the 
liability of the endorser. An endorser may limit his liability in any of the following ways: 
 
(i) By sans recourse endorsement, i.e. by making it clear that he does not incur the liability of an 
endorser to the endorsee or subsequent holders and they should not look to him in case of 
dishonour of instrument. The endorser excludes his liability by adding the words “sans recourse” 
or “without recourse”, e.g., “pay A or order sans recourse”. 
 
(ii) By making his liability depending upon happening of a specified event which may never happen, 
e.g., the holder of a bill may endorse it thus: “Pay A or order on his marrying B”. In such a case, 
the endorser will not be liable until A marries B. 
It is pertinent to refer to Section 52 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 here. It reads “The endorser of a 
negotiable instrument may, by express words in the endorsement exclude his own liability thereon, or make 
such liability or the right of the endorsee to receive the amount due thereon depend upon the happening of a 
specified event, although such event may never happen”. 
Negotiation Back 
Where an endorser negotiates an instrument and again becomes its holder, the instrument is said to be 
negotiated back to that endorser and none of the intermediary endorsees are then liable to him. The rule 
prevents a circuity of action.  For example, A, the holder of a bill endorses it to B, B endorses to C, and C to 
D, and endorses it again to A. A, being a holder in due course of the bill by second endorsement by D, can 
recover the amount thereof from B, C, or D and himself being a prior party is liable to all of them. Therefore, 
A having been relegated by the second endorsement to his original position, cannot sue B, C and D.  
Where an endorser so excludes his liability and afterwards becomes the holder of the instrument, all the 
intermediate endorsers are liable to him. “the italicised portion of the above Section is important”.  An 
illustration will make the point clear. A is the payee of a negotiable instrument. He endorses the instrument 
‘sans recourse’ to B, B endorses to C, C to D, and D again endorses it to A. In this case, A is not only 
reinstated in his former rights but has the right of an endorsee against B, C and D. 
Negotiation of Lost Instrument or that Obtained by Unlawful Means 
When a negotiable instrument has been lost or has been obtained from any maker, acceptor or holder 
thereof by means of an offence or fraud, or for an unlawful consideration, no possessor or endorsee, who 
claims through the person who found or obtained the instrument is entitled to receive the amount due 
thereon from such maker, acceptor, or holder from any party prior to such holder unless such possessor or 
endorsee is, or some person through whom he claims was, a holder in due course. 
EP-EBCL 
618 
Forged Endorsement 
The case of a forged endorsement is worth special notice. If an instrument is endorsed in full, it cannot be 
negotiated except by an endorsement signed by the person to whom or to whose order the instrument is 
payable, for the endorsee obtains title only through his endorsement. Thus, if an instrument be negotiated by 
means of a  forged endorsement, the endorsee acquires no title even though he be a purchaser for value and 
in good faith, for the endorsement is a nullity. Forgery conveys no title. But where the instrument is a bearer 
instrument or has been endorsed in blank, it can be negotiated by mere delivery, and the holder derives his title 
independent of the forged endorsement and can claim the amount from any of the parties to the instrument.  
For example, a bill is endorsed, “Pay A or order”. A endorses it in blank, and it comes into the hands of B, who 
simply delivers it to C, C forges B’s endorsement and transfer it to D. Here, D, as the holder does not derive his 
title through the forged endorsement of B, but through the genuine endorsement of A and can claim payment 
from any of the parties to the instrument in spite of the intervening forged endorsement. 
Acceptance of a Bill of Exchange 
The drawee of a bill of exchange, as such, has no liability on any bill addressed to him for acceptance or 
payment. A refusal to accept or to pay such bill gives the holder no rights against him. The drawee becomes 
liable only after he accepts the bill. The acceptor has to write the word ‘accepted’ on the bill and sign his 
name below it. Thus, it is the acceptor who is primarily liable on a bill. 
The acceptance of a bill is the indication by the drawee of his assent to the order of the drawer. Thus, when 
the drawee writes across the face of the bill the word “accepted” and signs his name underneath he 
becomes the acceptor of the bill. 
An acceptance may be either general or qualified. A general acceptance is absolute and as a rule, an 
acceptance has to be general.  Where an acceptance is made subject to some condition or qualification, 
thereby varying the effect of the bill, it is a qualified acceptance.   The holder of the bill may either refuse to 
take a qualified acceptance or non-acquiescence in it. Where he refuses to take it, he can treat the bill as 
dishonoured by non-acceptance, and sue the drawer accordingly. 
Acceptance for Honour  
When a bill has been noted or protested for non-acceptance or for better security, any person not being a 
party already liable thereon may, with the consent of the holder, by writing on the bill, accept the same for the 
honour of any party thereto. The stranger so accepting, will declare under his hand that he accepts the 
protested bill for the honour of the drawer or any particular endorser whom he names. 
The acceptor for honour is liable to pay only when the bill has been duly presented at maturity to the drawee for 
payment and the drawee has refused to pay and the bill has been noted and protested for non-payment. Where 
a bill has been protested for non-payment after having been duly accepted, any person may intervene and pay 
it supra protest for the honour of any party liable on the bill. When a bill is paid supra protest,  it ceases to be 
negotiable. The stranger, on paying for honour, acquires all the right of holder for whom he pays. 
Presentment for Acceptance  
It is only bills of exchange that require presentment for acceptance and even these of certain kinds only. Bills 
payable on demand or on a fixed date need not be presented. Thus, a bill payable 60 days after due date on 
the happening of a certain event may or may not be presented for acceptance. But the following bills must be 
presented for acceptance otherwise, the parties to the bill will not be liable on it: 
 
(a) A bill payable after sight. Presentment is necessary in order to fix maturity of the bills; and 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
619 
 
(b) A bill in which there is an express stipulation that it shall be presented for acceptance before it is 
presented for payment. 
Section 15 provides that the presentment for acceptance must be made to the drawee or his duly authorised 
agent. If the drawee is dead, the bill should be presented to his legal representative, or if he has been 
declared an insolvent, to the official receiver or assigner. 
The following are the persons to whom a bill of exchange should be presented: 
 
(i) The drawee or his duly authorised agent. 
 
(ii) If there are many drawees, bill must be presented to all of them. 
 
(iii) The legal representatives of the drawee if drawee is dead. 
 
(iv) The official receiver or assignee of insolvent drawee. 
 
(v) To a drawee in case of need, if there is any. This is necessary when the original drawee refuses to 
accept the bill. 
 
(vi) The acceptor for honour. In case the bill is not accepted and is noted or protested for non-
acceptance, the bill may be accepted by the acceptor for honour. He is a person who comes 
forward to accept the bill when it is dishonoured by non-acceptance. 
The presentment must be made before maturity, within a reasonable time after it is drawn, or within the 
stipulated period, if any, on a business day within business hours and at the place of business  or residence 
of the drawee. The presentment must be made by exhibiting the bill to the drawee; mere notice of its 
existence in the possession of holder will not be sufficient. 
When presentment is compulsory and the holder fails to present for acceptance, the drawer and all the 
endorsers are discharged from liability to him. 
Presentment for Acceptance when Excused 
Compulsory presentment for acceptance is excused and the bill may be treated as dishonoured in the 
following cases: 
 
(a) Where the drawee cannot be found after reasonable search. 
 
(b) Where drawee is a fictitious person or one incapable of contracting. 
 
(c) Where although the presentment is irregular, acceptance has been refused on some other ground. 
Presentment for Payment 
Section 64 lays down the general rule as to presentment of negotiable instruments for payment. It says all 
notes, bills and cheques must be presented for payment thereof respectively by or on behalf of the holder 
during the usual hours of business and of the maker or acceptor, and if at banker’s within banking hours. 
[Section 64(1)] 
As mentioned earlier, the definition of cheque has been broadened to include the electronic image of a 
truncated cheque and a cheque in the electronic form. Thus, the section has also been suitably amended to 
provide rules as to presentment of truncated cheque. The amendment, despite recognising electronic image 
of a truncated cheque, has made provision for the drawee bank to call for the truncated cheque in original if it 
is not satisfied about the instrument. 
Section 64(2) stipulates, where an electronic image of a truncated cheque is presented for payment, the 
EP-EBCL 
620 
drawee bank is entitled to demand any further information regarding the truncated cheque from the bank 
holding the truncated cheque in case of any reasonable suspicion about the genuineness of the apparent 
tenor of instrument, and if the suspicion is that of any fraud, forgery, tampering or destruction of the 
instrument, it is entitled to further demand the presentment of the truncated cheque itself for verification: 
Provided that the truncated cheque so demanded by the drawee bank shall be retained by it, if the payment 
is made accordingly. 
Presentment for Payment when Excused  
No presentment is necessary and the instrument may be treated as dishonoured in the following cases: 
 
(a) Where the maker, drawer or acceptor actively does something so as to intentionally obstruct the 
presentment of the instrument, e.g., deprives the holder of the instrument and keeps it after 
maturity. 
 
(b) Where his business place is closed on the due date. 
 
(c) Where no person is present to make payment at the place specified for payment. 
 
(d) Where he cannot, after due search be found. (Section 61) 
 
(e) Where there is a promise to pay notwithstanding non-presentment. 
 
(f) Where the presentment is express or impliedly waived by the party entitled to presentment. 
 
(g) Where the drawer could not possibly have suffered any damage by non-presentment. 
 
(h) Where the drawer is a fictitious person, or one incompetent to contract. 
 
(i) Where the drawer and the drawee are the same person. 
 
(j) Where the bill is dishonoured by non-acceptance. 
 
(k) Where presentment has become impossible, e.g., the declaration of war between the countries of 
the holder and drawee. 
 
(l) Where though the presentment is irregular, acceptance has been refused on some other grounds. 
Dishonour by Non-Acceptance 
Section 91 provides that a bill is said to be dishonoured by non-acceptance: 
 
(a) When the drawee does not accept it within 48 hours from the time of presentment for acceptance. 
 
(b) When presentment for acceptance is excused and the bill remains unaccepted. 
 
(c) When the drawee is incompetent to contract. 
 
(d) When the drawee is a fictitious person or after reasonable search can not be found. 
 
(e) Where the acceptance is a qualified one. 
Dishonour by Non-payment (Section 92) 
A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is said to be dishonoured by non-payment when the maker of 
the note, acceptor of the bill or drawee of the cheque makes default in payment upon being duly required to 
pay the same. Also, a negotiable instrument is dishonoured by non-payment when presentment for payment 
is excused and the instrument when overdue remains unpaid. 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
621 
If the bill is dishonoured either by non-acceptance or by non-payment, the drawer and all the endorsers of 
the bill are liable to the holder, provided he gives notice of such dishonour. The drawee is liable only when 
there is dishonour by non-payment. 
Notice of Dishonour (Sections 91-98 and Sections 105-107) 
When a negotiable instrument is dishonoured either by non-acceptance or by non-payment, the holder or 
some party liable thereon must give notice of dishonour to all other parties whom he seeks to make liable. 
Each party receiving notice of dishonour must in order to render any prior party liable to himself, give notice 
of dishonour to such party within a reasonable time after he has received it. The object of giving notice is not 
to demand payment but to whom the party notified of his liability and in case of drawer to enable him to 
protect himself as against the drawee or acceptor who has dishonoured the instrument issued by him. Notice 
of dishonour is so necessary that an omission to give it discharges all parties other than the maker or 
acceptor. These parties are discharged not only on the bill or note, but also in respect of the original 
consideration. 
Notice may be oral or in writing, but it must be actual formal notice. It must be given within a reasonable time 
of dishonour. 
Notice of Dishonour Unnecessary  
No notice of dishonour is necessary: 
 
(a) When it is dispensed with or waived by the party entitled thereto, e.g., where an endorser writes on 
the instrument such words as “notice of dishonour waived”, 
 
(b) When the drawer has countermanded payment. 
 
(c) When the party charged would not suffer damage for want of notice. 
 
(d) When the party entitled to notice cannot after due search be found. 
 
(e) When the omission to give notice is caused by unavoidable circumstances, e.g., death or 
dangerous illness of the holder. 
 
(f) Where the acceptor is also a drawer, e.g., where a firm draws on its branch. 
 
(g) Where the promissory note is not negotiable. Such a note cannot be endorsed. 
 
(h) Where the party entitled to notice promises to pay unconditionally. 
Noting and Protest (Sections 99-104 A) 
 
Noting 
Where a note or bill is dishonoured, the holder is entitled after giving due notice of dishonour, to sue the 
drawer and the endorsers. Section 99 provides a convenient method of  authenticating the   fact of dishonour 
by means of “Noting”. Where a bill or note is dishonoured, the holder may, if he so desires, cause such 
dishonour to be noted by a notary public on the instrument, or on a paper attached thereto or partly on each. 
The noting or minute must be recorded by the notary public within a reasonable time after dishonour and 
must contain the fact of dishonour, the date of dishonour, the reason, if any, assigned for such dishonour if 
the instrument has not been expressly dishonoured the reasons why the holder treats it dishonoured and 
notary’s charges. 
EP-EBCL 
622 
Protest 
The protest is the formal notarial certificate attesting the dishonour of the bill, and based upon the noting 
which has been effected on the dishonour of the bill. After the noting has been made, the formal protest is 
drawn up by the notary and when it is drawn up it relates back to the date of noting. 
Where the acceptor of a bill has become insolvent, or has suspended  payment, or his credit has been 
publicly impeached, before the maturity of the bill, the holder may have the bill protested for better security. 
The notary public demands better security and on its refusal makes a protest known as “protest for better 
security”.  
Foreign bills must be protested for dishonour when such protest is required by the law of the place where 
they are drawn. Foreign promissory notes need not be so protested. Where a bill is required by law to be 
protested, then instead of a notice of dishonour, notice of protest must be given by the notary public. 
A protest to be valid must contain on the instrument itself or a literal  transcript thereof, the names of the 
parties for and against whom protest is made, the fact and reasons for dishonour together with the place and 
time of dishonour and the signature of the notary public. Protest affords an authentic evidence of dishonour 
to the drawer and the endorsee. 
Discharge 
The discharge in relation to negotiable instrument may be either (i) discharge of the instrument or (ii) 
discharge of one or more parties to the instrument from liability. 
Discharge of the Instrument 
A negotiable instrument is discharged: 
 
(a) by payment in due course; 
 
(b) when the principal debtor becomes the holder; 
 
(c) by an act that would discharge simple contract; 
 
(d) by renunciation; and  
 
(e) by cancellation. 
Discharge of a Party or Parties 
When any particular party or parties are discharged, the instrument continues to be negotiable and the 
undischarged parties remain liable on it. For example, the non-presentment of a bill on the due date 
discharges the endorsers from their liability, but the acceptor remains liable on it. 
A party may be discharged in the following ways : 
 
(a) By cancellation by the holder of the name of any party to it with the intention of discharging him. 
 
(b) By release, when the holder releases any party to the instrument  
 
(c) Discharge of secondary parties, i.e., endorsers. 
 
(d) By the operation of the law, i.e., by insolvency of the debtor. 
 
(e) By allowing drawee more than 48 hours to accept the bill, all previous parties are discharged. 
 
(f) By non-presentment of cheque promptly the drawer is discharged. 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
623 
 
(g) By taking qualified acceptance, all the previous parties are discharged.  
 
(h) By material alteration.  
Material Alteration (Section 87) 
An alteration is material which in any way alters the operation of the instrument and the liabilities of the 
parties thereto. Therefore, any change in an instrument which causes it to speak a different language in legal 
effect from that which it originally spoke, or which changes legal character of the instrument is a material 
alteration.  
A material alteration renders the instrument void, but it affects only those persons who have already become 
parties at the date of the alteration. Those who take the altered instrument cannot complain. Section 88 
provides that an acceptor or endorser of a negotiable instrument is bound by his acceptance or endorsement 
notwithstanding any previous alteration of the instrument. 
Examples of material alteration are : 
Alteration (i) of the date of the instrument (ii) of the sum payable, (iii) in the time of payment, (iv) of the place 
of payment,(v) of the rate of interest,  (vi) by addition of a new party, (vii) tearing the instrument in a material 
part. 
There is no material alteration and the instrument is not vitiated in the following cases: 
(i) correction of a mistake,  (ii) to carry out the common intention of the parties, (iii) an alteration made before 
the instrument is issued and made with the consent of the parties, (iv) crossing a cheque, (v) addition of the 
words “on demand” in an instrument where no time of payment is stated. 
Section 89 affords protection to a person who pays an altered note bill or cheque. However, in order to be 
able to claim the protection, the following conditions must be fulfilled: 
 
(i) the alteration should not be apparent; 
 
(ii) the payment must be made in due course; and 
 
(iii) the payment must be by a person or banker liable to pay. 
Section 89 has been amended to provide for the amendment in the definition of cheque so as to provide for 
electronic image of a truncated cheque. The section provides that any bank or a clearing house which 
receives a transmitted electronic image of a truncated cheque, shall verify from the party who transmitted the 
image to it, that the image so transmitted to it and received by it, is exactly the same. Where there is any 
difference in apparent tenor of such electronic image and the truncated cheque, it shall be a material 
alteration. In such a case, it shall be the duty of the bank or the clearing house, as the case may be, to 
ensure the exactness of the apparent tenor of electronic image of the truncated cheque while truncating and 
transmitting the image. If the bank fails to discharge this duty, the payment made by it shall not be regarded 
as good and it shall not be afforded protection. 
Retirement of a Bill under Rebate 
An acceptor of a bill may make payment before maturity,  and the bill is then said to be retired, but it is not 
discharged and must not be cancelled except by the acceptor when it comes into his hands. It is customary 
in such a case to make allowance of interest on the money to the acceptor for the remainder of the time 
which the bill has to run. The interest allowance is known as rebate.

Hundis 
Hundis are negotiable instruments written in an oriental language. They are sometimes bills of exchange and 
sometimes promissory notes, and are not covered under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Generally, 
they are governed by the customs and usages in the locality but if custom is silent on the point in dispute 
before the Court, this Act applies to the hundis. The term “hundi” was formerly applicable to native bills of 
exchange. The promissory notes were then called “teep”. The hundis were in circulation in India even before 
the present Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 came into operation. The usages attached to these hundis 
varied with the locality in which they were in circulation. 
Generally understood, the term “hundi” includes all indigenous negotiable instruments whether they are bills 
of exchange or promissory notes. An instrument in order to be a hundi must be capable of being sued by the 
holder in his own name, and must by the custom of trade be transferred like cash by delivery. Obviously the 
customs relating to hundis were many. In certain parts of the country even oral acceptance was in vague. 
The following types of hundis are worth mentioning : 
1.  Shah Jog Hundi 
“Shah” means a respectable and responsible person or a man of worth in the bazar. Shah Jog Hundi means 
a hundi which is payable only to a respectable holder, as opposed to a hundi payable to bearer. In other 
words the drawee before paying the same has to satisfy himself that the payee is a ‘SHAH’. 
2.  Jokhmi Hundi 
A “jokhmi” hundi is always drawn on or against goods shipped on the vessel mentioned in the hundi. It 
implies a condition that money will be paid only in the event of arrival of the goods against which the hundi is 
drawn. It is in the nature of policy of insurance. The difference, however, is that the money is paid before 
hand and is to be recovered if the ship arrives safely. 
3.  Jawabee Hundi 
According to Macpherson, “A person desirous of making a remittance writes to the payee and delivers the 
letter to a banker, who either endorses it on to any of his correspondents near the payee’s place of 
residence, or negotiates its transfer. On the arrival, the letter is forwarded to the payee, who attends and 
gives his receipt in the form of an answer to the letter which is forwarded by the same channel of the drawer 
or the order.” Therefore, this is a form of hundi which is used for remitting money from one place to another. 
4.   Nam jog Hundi 
It is a hundi payable to the party named in the bill or his order. The name of the payee is specifically inserted 
in the hundi. It can also be negotiated like a bill of exchange. Its alteration into a Shah Jog hundi is a material 
alteration and renders it void. 
5.  Darshani Hundi 
This is a hundi payable at sight. It is freely negotiable and the price is regulated by demand and supply. They 
are payable on demand and must be presented for payment within a reasonable time after they are received 
by the holder. 
6.  Miadi Hundi 
This is otherwise called muddati hundi, that is, a hundi payable after a specified period of time. Usually 
money is advanced against these hundis by shroffs after deducting the advance for the period in advance. 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
625 
There are other forms of hundis also like. 
Dhani Jog Hundi - A hundi which is payable to “dhani” i.e., the owner. 
Firman Jog Hundi - which is payable to order if can be negotiated by endorsement and delivery. 
Presumptions of Law 
A negotiable instrument is subject to certain presumptions. These have been recognised by the Negotiable 
Instruments Act under Sections 118 and 119 with a view to facilitate the business transactions. These are 
described below: 
It shall be presumed that: 
 
(1) Every negotiable instrument was made or drawn for consideration irrespective of the consideration 
mentioned in the instrument or not. 
 
(2) Every negotiable instrument having a date was made on such date. 
 
(3) Every accepted bill of exchange was accepted within a reasonable time before its maturity. 
 
(4) Every negotiable instrument was transferred before its maturity. 
 
(5) The instruments were endorsed in the order in which they appear on it. 
 
(6) A lost  or destroyed instrument was duly signed and stamped. 
 
(7) The holder of the instrument is a holder in due course. 
 
(8) In a suit upon an instrument which has been dishonoured, the Court shall presume the fact of 
dishonour, or proof of the protest. 
However these legal presumptions are rebuttable by evidence to the contrary. The burden to prove to the 
contrary lies upon the defendant to the suit and not upon the plaintiff. 
Payment of Interest in case of dishonour 
The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 was amended in the year 1988, revising the rate of interest as 
contained in Sections 80 and 117, from 6 per cent to 18 per cent per annum payable on negotiable 
instruments from the due date in case no rate of interest is specified, or payable to an endorser from the date 
of payment on a negotiable instrument on its dishonour with a view to discourage the withholding of payment 
on negotiable instruments on due dates. 
Penalties in case of dishonour of cheques 
Chapter XVII of the Negotiable Instruments Act provides for penalties in case of dishonour  of  certain  
cheques  for  insufficiencies  of  funds  in  the  accounts. Sections 138 to 147 deal with these aspects. 
Chapter XVII has been amended by the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions) 
Act, 2002. The amendments have provided the drawer with more time to send notice, made the punishment 
for the offence more stringent, given power to court for condonation of delay in filing of complaint, excluded 
liability of government nominated directors, made provision for summary trial of cases under the Chapter and 
time bound disposal of cases, have relaxed the rules of evidence, and made the offences under the Act 
compoundable. 
EP-EBCL 
626 
The working of the provisions of Chapter XVII for a period of more than a decade had brought to the fore 
front various lacunae and shortcomings from which it suffered. It was seen that there were enormous delays 
in the disposal of the cases filed under Section 138 and the drawer of the cheques, by taking shield of 
various technicalities and procedures were frustrating the very object of the Chapter. 
The provisions contained in this Chapter provide that where any cheque drawn by a person for discharge of 
any liability is returned by the bank unpaid for the reason of insufficiency of the amount of money standing to 
the credit of the account on which the cheque was drawn or for the reason that it exceeds the arrangement 
made by the drawer of the cheque with the banker for that account, the drawer of such cheque shall be 
deemed to have committed an offence. In that case, the drawer, without prejudice to the other provisions of 
the Act, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine which 
may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both. 
In order to constitute the said offence  
 
(a) such cheque should have been presented to the bank within a period of six months from the date on 
which it is drawn or within the period of its validity, whichever is earlier; and  
 
(b) the payee or holder in due course of such cheque should have made a demand for the payment of 
the said amount of money by giving notice, in writing, to the drawer of the cheque within thirty days 
of the receipt of information by him from the bank regarding the return of the cheque unpaid; and  
 
(c) the drawer of such cheque should have failed to make the payment of the said amount of money to 
the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque within fifteen days of the receipt of the said 
notice. 
It has also been provided that it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that the holder of such 
cheque received the cheque in the discharge of a liability. Defences which may or may not be allowed in any 
prosecution for such offence have also been provided to make the provisions effective. The Supreme Court 
in Modi Cements Ltd. v. K.K. Nandi, (1988) 28 CLA 491, held that merely because the drawer issued a 
notice to the drawee or to the Bank for ‘stop payment’, it would not preclude an action under Section 138 by 
the drawee or holder in due course. 
The liability of government nominated directors  has been  excluded under Section 141 of the Act dealing 
with ‘offences by companies’. The second proviso inserted in Section 141 by the Amendment Act, 2002 
provides that where a person is nominated as a director of a company by virtue of his holding any office or 
employment in the Central Government or State Government or a financial corporation owned or controlled 
by the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be, he shall not be liable for 
prosecution under this Chapter. In order to ensure that genuine and honest bank customers are not 
harassed or put to inconvenience, sufficient safeguards have also been provided in the new Chapter, as 
under: 
 
(a) that no court shall take cognizance of such offence except on a complaint in writing, made by the 
payee or the holder in due course of the cheque; 
 
(b) that such complaint is made within one month or the date on which the cause of action arises; 
 
 Provided that the cognizance of a complaint may be taken by the court after the prescribed period, if 
the complainant satisfies the court that he had sufficient cause for not making the complaint within 
such period. 
 
(c) that no court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial magistrate of the first class 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
627 
shall try any such offence. (Section 142) 
Moreover, the new Sections inserted by the Amendment Act, 2002 provide that all offences under this 
Chapter shall be tried by a Judicial Magistrate of the first class or by a Metropolitan Magistrate and the 
provisions of Sections 262 to 265 (both inclusive) of the said Code shall, as far as may be, apply to such 
trials: 
Provided that in the case of any conviction in a summary trial under this Section, it shall be lawful for the 
Magistrate to pass a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year and an amount of fine 
exceeding five thousand rupees: 
Provided further that when at the commencement of, or in the course of, a summary trial under this Section, 
it appears to the Magistrate that the nature of the case is such that a sentence of imprisonment for a term 
exceeding one year may have to be passed or that it is, for any other reason, undesirable to try the case 
summarily, the Magistrate shall, after hearing the parties, record an order to that effect and thereafter recall 
any witness who may have been examined and proceed to hear or rehear the case in the manner provided 
by the said Code. 
According to the sub-section (2) of Section 142 of the Negotiable Instrument (Amendment) Act, 2015, the 
offence under section 138 shall be inquired into and tried only by a court within whose local jurisdiction,— 
if the cheque is delivered for collection through an account, the branch of the bank where the payee or holder 
in due course, as the case may be, maintains the account, is situated; or 
if the cheque is presented for payment by the payee or holder in due course, otherwise through an account, 
the branch of the drawee bank where the drawer maintains the account, is situated. 
Explanation. – For the purposes of clause (a), where a cheque is delivered for collection at any branch of the 
bank of the payee or holder in due course, then, the cheque shall be deemed to have been delivered to the 
branch of the bank in which the payee or holder in due course, as the case may be, maintains the account.”. 
(2) The trial of a case under this Section shall, so far as practicable, consistently with the interests of justice, 
be continued from day to day until its conclusion, unless the court finds the adjournment of the trial beyond 
the following day to be necessary for reasons to be recorded in writing. 
(3) Every trial under this Section shall be conducted as expeditiously as possible and an endeavour shall be 
made to conclude the trial within six months from the date of filing of the complaint. (Section 143) 
A Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at 
the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business or personally works for 
gain, by speed post or by such courier services as are approved by a Court of Session. 
Where an acknowledgement purporting to be signed by the accused or the witness or an endorsement 
purported to be made by any person authorised by the postal department or the courier services that the 
accused or the witness refused to take delivery of summons has been received, the court issuing the 
summons may declare that the summons has been duly served. (Section 144) 
The evidence of the complainant may be given by him on affidavit and may, subject to all just exceptions be 
read in evidence in any enquiry, trial or other proceeding under the said Code. 
The court may, if it thinks fit, and shall, on the application of the prosecution or the accused, summon and 
EP-EBCL 
628 
examine any person giving evidence on affidavit as to the facts contained therein. (Section 145) 
The court shall, in respect of every proceeding under this Chapter, on production of bank’s slip or memo 
having thereon the official mark denoting that the cheque has been dishonoured, presume the fact of 
dishonour of such cheque, unless and until such fact is disproved. Every offence punishable under this Act 
shall be compoundable. (Sections 146 and 147) 
The practical effect of these amendments which have only recently been brought into force would be seen 
with time to come but it is expected that they would go a long way in making the remedy provided for by 
Chapter XVII meaningful and effective. 
National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) and Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) 
National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) is a nation-wide payment system facilitating one-to-one funds 
transfer. Under this Scheme, individuals, firms and corporates can electronically transfer funds from any 
bank branch to any individual, firm or corporate having an account with any other bank branch in the country 
participating in the Scheme. 
NEFT is an electronic fund transfer system that operates on a Deferred Net Settlement (DNS) basis which 
settles transactions in batches. In DNS, the settlement takes place with all transactions received till the 
particular cut-off time. These transactions are netted (payable and receivables) in NEFT whereas in RTGS 
the transactions are settled individually. For example, currently, NEFT operates in hourly batches. Any 
transaction initiated after a designated settlement time would have to wait till the next designated settlement 
time Contrary to this, in the RTGS transactions are processed continuously throughout the RTGS business 
hours. 
The acronym ‘RTGS’ stands for Real Time Gross Settlement, which can be defined as the continuous (real- 
time) settlement of funds transfers individually on an order by order basis (without netting). ‘Real Time’ 
means the processing of instructions at the time they are received rather than at some later time; ‘Gross 
Settlement’ means the settlement of funds transfer instructions occurs individually (on an instruction by 
instruction basis). Considering that the funds settlement takes place in the books of the Reserve Bank of 
India, the payments are final and irrevocable. 
LESSON ROUND-UP 
• The law relating to negotiable instruments is contained in the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. It is an Act 
to define and amend the law relating to promissory notes, bills of exchange and Cheques. 
• The term “negotiable instrument” means a document transferable from one person to another. 
• A “promissory note” is an instrument in writing containing an unconditional undertaking, signed by the 
maker to pay a certain sum of money to, or to the order of, a certain person, or only to bearer of the 
instrument. 
• A “bill of exchange” is an instrument in writing containing an unconditional order, signed by the maker, 
directing a certain person to pay a certain sum of money only to or to the order of, a certain person or to the 
bearer of the instrument. 
• Bills of exchange were originally used for payment of debts by traders residing in one country to another 
country with a view to avoid transmission of coin. Now-a-days they are used more as trade bills both in 
connection with domestic trade and foreign trade and are called inland bills and foreign bills respectively. 
• A ‘Cheque’ is a bill of exchange drawn on a specified banker and not expressed to be payable otherwise 
than  on demand  and it  includes the  electronic image  of a  truncated Cheque  and a  Cheque  in  the 
electronic form. 
                                                                       Lesson 24        Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881

EXECUTIVE PROGRAMME 
GENERAL AND COMMERCIAL LAWS 
This study material has been published to aid the students in preparing 
for the General and Commercial Laws paper of the CS Executive 
Programme. It has been prepared to provide basic understanding of some of 
the General and Commercial Laws thereunder, which have a bearing on the 
conduct of corporate affairs. It is part of the educational kit and takes the 
students step by step through each phase of preparation stressing key 
concepts, pointers and procedures. Company Secretaryship being a 
professional course, the examination standards are set very high, with 
emphasis on knowledge of concepts, applications, procedures and case 
laws, for which sole reliance on the contents of this study material may not be 
enough. Besides, as per the Company Secretaries Regulations, 1982, 
students are expected to be conversant with the amendments to the laws 
made upto six months preceding the date of examination. The material may, 
therefore, be regarded as the basic material and must be read alongwith the 
original Bare Acts, Rules, Regulations, Case Law, Student Company 
Secretary Bulletin published and supplied to the students by the Institute 
every month as well as recommended readings given with each study lesson. 
This study material has been updated upto August, 2011.  The subject of 
General and Commercial Laws is inherently complicated and is subjected to 
constant refinement through new primary legislations, rules and regulations 
made thereunder and court decisions on specific legal issues. It, therefore 
becomes necessary for every student to constantly update himself with the 
various legislative changes made as well as judicial pronouncements 
rendered from time to time by referring to the Institute’s journal ‘Chartered 
Secretary’ and bulletin ‘Student Company Secretary’ as well as other 
law/professional journals. 
In the event of any doubt, students may write to the Directorate of 
Academics and Professional Development of the Institute for clarification. 
The Right to Information Act, 2005 considered as watershed legislation, 
is the most significant milestone in the history of Right to Information 
movement in India allowing transparency and autonomy and access to 
accountability. A new chapter titled Law Relating to Information Technology 
has been included in this study material to enable the students to understand 
the significance of right to information in the changing scenario, and be well 
versed with the important provisions of the Right to Information Act. 
Although care has been taken in publishing this study material yet the 
possibility of errors, omissions and/or discrepancies cannot be ruled out. This 
 
(iv) 
publication is released with an understanding that the Institute shall not be 
responsible for any errors, omissions and/or discrepancies or any action 
taken in that behalf. 
Should there be any discrepancy, error or omission noted in the study 
material, the Institute shall be obliged if the same is brought to its notice for 
issue of corrigendum in the Student Company Secretary. 
The study material contains 10 study lessons. At the end of study 
material, Test Papers are appended. Students may note that Test Papers 1 
and 2 are Optional, whereas Test Papers 3, 4 and 5 are Compulsory. 
Students are advised to submit answers to the Test Papers strictly under 
examination conditions after making through preparation.

I.  BROAD FRAMEWORK OF THE CONSTITUTION 
The Constitution of India came into force on January 26, 1950. It is a 
comprehensive document containing 395 Articles (divided into 22 Parts) and 12 
Schedules. Apart from dealing with the structure of Government, the Constitution 
makes detailed provisions for the rights of citizens and other persons in a number of 
entrenched provisions and for the principles to be followed by the State in the 
governance of the country, labelled as ―Directive Principles of State Policy‖.  All public 
authorities – legislative, administrative and judicial derive their powers directly or 
indirectly from it and the Constitution derives its authority from the people.

1.  Preamble 
The preamble to the Constitution sets out the aims and aspirations of the people 
of India. It is a part of the Constitution (AIR 1973 SC 1961). The preamble declares 
India to be a Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic Republic and secures to all its 
citizens Justice, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity. It is declared that the Constitution 
has been given by the people to themselves, thereby affirming the republican 
character of the polity and the sovereignty of the people. 
The polity assured to the people of India by the Constitution is described in the 
preamble as a Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, and Democratic Republic. The 
expression ―Sovereign‖ signifies that the Republic is externally and internally 
sovereign. Sovereignty in the strict and narrowest sense of the term implies 
independence all round, within and without the borders of the country.  As discussed 
above, legal sovereignty is vested in the people of India and political sovereignty is 
distributed between the Union and the States. 
The democratic character of the Indian polity is illustrated by the provisions 
conferring on the adult citizens the right to vote and by the provisions for elected 
representatives and responsibility of the executive to the legislature. 
The word ―Socialist‖, added by the 42nd Amendment, aims to secure to its 
people ―justice—social, economic and political‖. The Directive Principles of State 
Policy,  contained  in  Part IV  of  the  Constitution  are  designed  for  the 
achievement of the socialistic goal envisaged in the preamble. The expression 
―Democratic Republic‖ signifies that our government is of the people, by the people 
and for the people. 
2.  Structure 
Constitution of India is basically federal but with certain unitary features. 
The majority of the Supreme Court judges in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of 
Kerala, AIR 1973 SC 1461, were of the view that the federal features form the basic 
structure of the Indian Constitution. However, there is some controversy as to 
whether the Indian Constitution establishes a federal system or it stipulates a unitary 
form of Government with some basic federal features. Thus, to decide whether our 
Constitution is federal, unitary or quasi federal, it would be better to have a look at the 
contents of the Constitution. 
The essential features of a Federal Polity or System are—dual Government, 
distribution of powers, supremacy of the Constitution, independence of Judiciary, 
written Constitution, and a rigid procedure for the amendment of the Constitution. The 
political system introduced by our Constitution possesses all the aforesaid essentials 
of a federal polity as follows: 
 (a) In India, there are Governments at different levels, like Union and States. 
 (b) Powers to make laws have been suitably distributed among them by way of 
various lists as per the Seventh Schedule. 
 (c) Both Union and States have to follow the Constitutional provisions when they 
make laws. 
 
EP-GCL-1 
3
 (d) The Judiciary is independent with regard to judicial matters and judiciary can 
test the validity of law independently. The Supreme Court decides the 
disputes between the Union and the States, or the States inter se. 
 (e) The Constitution is supreme and if it is to be amended, it is possible only by 
following the procedure explained in Article 368 of the Constitution itself. 
From the above, it is clear that the Indian Constitution basically has federal 
features. But the Indian Constitution does not establish two co-ordinate independent 
Governments. Both the Governments co-ordinate, co-operate and collaborate in each 
other‘s efforts to achieve the ideals laid down in the preamble.  
Judicial View 
The question as to whether the Indian Constitution has a federal form of 
Government or a unitary constitution with some federal features came up in various 
cases before the Supreme Court and the High Courts. But in most cases, the 
observations have been made in a particular context and have to be understood 
accordingly. The question rests mostly on value judgement i.e. on one‘s own 
philosophy. 
Peculiar Features of Indian Federalism 
Indian Constitution differs from the federal systems of the world in certain 
fundamental aspects, which are as follows: 
(1) The Mode of Formation: A federal Union, as in the American system, is 
formed by an agreement between a number of sovereign and independent States, 
surrendering a defined part of their sovereignty or autonomy to a new central 
organisation. But there is an alternative mode of federation, as in the Canadian 
system where the provinces of a Unitary State may be transformed into a federal 
union to make themselves autonomous. 
India had a thoroughly Centralised Unitary Constitution until the Government of 
India Act, 1935 which for the first time set up a federal system in the manner as in 
Canada viz., by creation of autonomous units and combining them into a federation 
by one and the same Act. 
(2) Position of the States in the Federation: In a federal system, a number of 
safeguards are provided for the protection of State‘s rights as they are independent 
before the formation of federation. In India, as the States were not previously 
sovereign entities, the rights were exercised mainly by Union, e.g., residuary powers. 
(3) Citizenship etc: The framers of the American Constitution made a logical 
division of everything essential to sovereignty and created a dual polity with dual 
citizenship, a double set of officials and a double system of the courts. There is, 
however, single citizenship in India, with no division of public services or of the 
judiciary. 
(4) Residuary Power: Residuary power is vested in the Union.  In other words, 
the Constitution of India is neither purely federal nor purely unitary. It is a combination 
of both and is based upon the principle that ―In spite of federalism the national 
interest ought to be paramount as against autocracy stepped with the establishment 
of supremacy of law‖.

II.  FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS 
The Constitution seeks to secure to the people ―liberty of thought, expression, 
belief, faith and worship; equality of status and of opportunity; and fraternity assuring 
the dignity of the individual‖. With this object, the fundamental rights are envisaged in 
Part III of the Constitution. 
1.  The Concept of Fundamental Rights 
Political philosophers in the 17th Century began to think that the man by birth had 
certain rights which were universal and inalienable, and he could not be deprived of 
them. The names of Rousseau, Locke, Montaesgue and Blackstone may be noted in 
this context. The Declaration of American Independence 1776, stated that all men are 
created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights: 
that among these, are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Since the 17th 
century, it had been considered that man has certain essential, basic, natural and 
inalienable rights and it is the function of the State to recognise these rights and allow 
them a free play so that human liberty may be preserved, human personality 
developed and an effective cultural, social and democratic life promoted. It was 
thought that these rights should be entrenched in such a way that they may not be 
interfered with, by an oppressive or transient majority in the Legislature. With this in 
view, some written Constitutions (especially after the First World War) guarantee 
rights of the people and forbid every organ of the Government from interfering with 
the same. 
The position in England: The Constitution of England is unwritten. No Code of 
Fundamental Rights exists unlike in the Constitution of the United States or India. In 
the doctrine of the sovereignty of Parliament as prevailing in England it does not 
envisage a legal check on the power of the Parliament which is, as a matter of legal 
theory, free to make any law. This does not mean, however, that in England there is 
no recognition of these basic rights of the individual. The object in fact is secured 
here in a different way. The protection of individual freedom in England rests not on 
constitutional guarantees but on public opinion, good sense of the people, strong 
common law, traditions favouring individual liberty, and the parliamentary form of 
Government. Moreover, the participation of U.K. in the European Union has made a 
difference. (See also the Human Rights Act, 1998). 
The position in America: The nature of the Fundamental Rights in the U.S.A. has 
been described thus: The very purpose of the Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain 
 
EP-GCL-1 
5
subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach 
of majorities and officials, to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the 
Courts. 
The fundamental difference in approach to the question of individual rights 
between England and the United States is that while the English were anxious to 
protect individual rights from the abuses of executive power, the framers of the 
American Constitution were apprehensive of tyranny, not only from the executive but 
also from the legislature. While the English people, in their fight for freedom against 
autocracy stopped with the establishment of Parliamentary supremacy, the 
Americans went further to assert that there had to be a law superior to the legislature 
itself and that the restraint of such paramount written law could only save them from 
the fears of absolution and autocracy which are ingrained in the human nature. 
So, the American Bill of Rights (contained in first ten Amendments of the 
Constitution of the U.S.A.) is equally binding upon the legislature, as upon the 
executive. The result has been the establishment in the United States of a ‗Judicial 
Supremacy‘, as opposed to the ‗Parliamentary Supremacy‘ in England. The Courts in 
the United States are competent to declare an Act of Congress as unconstitutional on 
the ground of contravention of any provision of the Bill of Rights. 
The position in India: As regards India, the Simon Commission and the Joint 
Parliamentary Committee had rejected the idea of enacting declaration of 
Fundamental Rights on the ground that abstract declarations are useless, unless 
there exists the will and the means to make them effective. The Nehru Committee 
recommended the inclusion of Fundamental Rights in the Constitution for the country. 
Although that demand of the people was not met by the British Parliament under the 
Government of India Act, 1935, yet the enthusiasm of the people to have such rights 
in the Constitution was not impaired. As a result of that enthusiasm they were 
successful in getting a recommendation being included in the Statement of May 16, 
1946 made by the Cabinet Mission-(which became the basis of the present 
Constitution) to the effect that the Constitution-making body may adopt the rights in 
the Constitution. Therefore, as soon as Constituent Assembly began to work in 
December, 1947, in its objectives resolution Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru moved for the 
protection of certain rights to be provided in the Constitution. The rights as they 
emerged are contained in Part III of the Constitution the title of which is ―Fundamental 
Rights‖. The Supreme Court in Pratap Singh v. State of Jharkhand, (2005) 3 SCC 
551 held that Part III of the Constitution protects substantive as well as procedural 
rights and hence implications which arise there from must efficiently be protected by 
the Judiciary. 
2.  Inclusion of Fundamental Rights in Part III of the Constitution 
Part III of the Indian Constitution guarantees six categories of 
fundamental rights. These are: 
 
(i) Right to Equality—Articles 14 to 18; 
 
(ii) Right to Freedom—Articles 19 to 22; 
 (iii) Right against Exploitation—Articles 23 and 24; 
 (iv) Right to Freedom of Religion—Articles 25 to 28; 
EP-GCL-1 
6
 (v) Cultural and Educational Rights—Articles 29 and 30; 
 (vi) Right to Constitutional Remedies—Articles 32. 
[Earlier the right to property under Article 31 was also guaranteed as a 
Fundamental Right which has been removed by the 44th Constitutional Amendment 
Act, 1978. Now right to property is not a fundamental right, it is now only a legal right. 
Apart from this, Articles 12 and 13 deal with definition of ‗State‘ and ‗Law‘ 
respectively. Articles 33 to 35 deal with the general provisions relating to 
Fundamental Rights. No fundamental right in India is absolute and reasonable 
restrictions can be imposed in the interest of the state by valid legislation and in such 
case the Court normally would respect the legislative policy behind the same. 
People’s Union for Civil Liberties  v. Union of India, (2004) 2 SCC 476. 
From the point of view of persons to whom the rights are available, the 
fundamental rights may be classified as follows: 
 (a) Articles 15, 16, 19 and 30 are guaranteed only to citizens. 
 (b) Articles 14, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 27 and 28 are available to any person on the 
soil of India—citizen or foreigner. 
 (c) The rights guaranteed by Articles 15, 17, 18, 20, 24 are absolute limitations 
upon the legislative power. 
For convenience as well as for their better understanding it is proper to take each 
of these separately. But some related terms are necessary to be understood first. 
3.  Definition of State 
With a few exceptions, all the fundamental rights are available against the State. 
Under Article 12, unless the context otherwise requires, ―the State‖ includes— 
 (a) the Government and Parliament of India; 
 (b) the Government and the Legislature of each of the States; and 
 (c) all local or other authorities: 
 
(i) within the territory of India; or 
 
(ii) under the control of the Government of India. 
The expression ‗local authorities‘ refers to authorities like Municipalities, District 
Boards, Panchayats, Improvement Trusts, Port Trusts and Mining Settlement Boards. 
The Supreme Court has held that ‗other authorities‘ will include all authorities created 
by the Constitution or statute on whom powers are conferred by law and it is not 
necessary that the authority should engage in performing government functions 
(Electricity Board, Rajasthan v. Mohanlal, AIR 1967 SC 1957).  The Calcutta High 
Court has held that the electricity authorities being State within the meaning of Article 
12, their action can be judicially reviewed by this Court under Article 226 of the 
Constitution of India. (In re: Angur Bala Parui, AIR 1999 Cal. 102). It has also been 
held that a university is an authority (University of Madras v. Shanta Bai, AIR 1954 
Mad. 67). The Gujarat High Court has held that the President is ―State‖ when making 
an order under Article 359 of the Constitution (Haroobhai v. State of Gujarat, AIR 
1967, Guj. 229). The words ―under the control of the Government of India‖ bring, into 
the definition of State, not only every authority within the territory of India, but also 
 
EP-GCL-1 
7
those functioning outside, provided such authorities are under the control of the 
Government of India. In Bidi Supply Co. v. Union of India, AIR 1956 SC 479, State 
was interpreted to include its Income-tax department. 
The Supreme Court in Sukhdev Singh v. Bhagatram, AIR 1975 SC 1331 and in 
R.D. Shetty v. International Airports Authority, AIR 1979 SC 1628, has pointed out 
that corporations acting as instrumentality or agency of government would become 
‗State‘ because obviously they are subjected to the same limitations in the field of 
constitutional or administrative law as the government itself, though in the eye of law 
they would be distinct and independent legal entities. In Satish Nayak v. Cochin 
Stock Exchange Ltd. (1995 Comp LJ 35), the Kerala High Court held that since a 
Stock Exchange was independent of Government control and was not discharging 
any public duty, it cannot be treated as ‗other authority‘ under Article 12. 
Test for instrumentality or agency of the State 
In Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib, AIR 1981 SC 481, the Supreme Court has 
enunciated the following test for determining whether an entity is an 
instrumentality or agency of the State: 
 
(1) If the entire share capital of the Corporation is held 
by the Government, it would go a long way towards 
indicating that the corporation is an instrumentality or 
agency of the Government. 
 
(2) Where the financial assistance of the State is so 
much as to meet almost the entire expenditure of the 
corporation it would afford some indication of the corporation being 
impregnated with government character. 
 (3) Whether the corporation enjoys a monopoly status which is conferred 
or protected by the State. 
 (4) Existence of deep and pervasive State control may afford an indication 
that the corporation is a State agency or an instrumentality. 
 (5) If the functions of the corporation are of public importance and closely 
related to government functions, it would be a relevant factor in 
classifying a corporation as an instrumentality or agency of 
government. 
 (6) If a department of government is transferred to a corporation, it would 
be a strong factor supporting an inference of the corporation being an 
instrumentality or agency of government. 
An important decision on the definition of State in Article 12 is Pradeep Kumar 
Biswas  v. Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, (2002) 5 SCC 111. A seven 
Judge Bench of the Supreme Court by a majority of 5:2 held that CSIR is an 
instrumentality of “the State” falling within the scope of Article 12. The multiple 
test which is to be applied to ascertain the character of a body as falling within 
Article 12 or outside is to ascertain the nature of financial, functional and 
administrative control of the State over it and whether it is dominated by the 
State Government and the control can be said to be so deep and pervasive so 
as to satisfy the court “of brooding presence of the Government” on the 
activities of the body concerned.  
EP-GCL-1 
8
In Zee Telefilms Ltd.  v. Union of India, (2005) 4 SCC 649, the Supreme 
Court applying the tests laid down in Pardeep Kumar Biswas case held that the 
Board of Control for cricket in India (BCCI) was not State for purposes of 
Article 12 because it was not shown to be financially, functionally or 
administratively dominated by or under the control of the Government and 
control exercised by the Government was not pervasive but merely regulatory 
in nature. 
Judiciary although an organ of State like the executive and the legislature, is not 
specifically mentioned in Article 12. However, the position is that where the Court 
performs judicial functions, e.g. determination of scope of fundamental rights vis-a-vis 
legislature or executive action, it will not occasion the infringement of fundamental 
rights and therefore it will not come under ‗State‘ in such situation (A.R. Antualay v. 
R.S. Nayak, (1988) 2 SCC 602). While in exercise of non-judicial functions e.g. in 
exercise of rule-making powers, where a Court makes rules which contravene the 
fundamental rights of citizens, the same could be challenged treating the Court as 
‗State‘. 
4.  Justifiability of Fundamental Rights 
Article 13 gives teeth to the fundamental rights. It lays down the 
rules of interpretation in regard to laws inconsistent with or in derogation 
of the Fundamental Rights. 
Exsiting Laws: Article 13(1) relates to the laws already existing in 
force, i.e. laws which were in force before the commencement of the 
Constitution (pre constitutional laws). A declaration by the Court of their invalidity, 
however, will be necessary before they can be disregarded and declares that pre-
constitution laws are void to the extent to which they are inconsistent with the 
fundamental rights. 
Future Laws: Article 13(2) relates to future laws, i.e., laws made after the 
commencement of the Constitution (post constitutional laws). After the Constitution 
comes into force the State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the 
rights conferred by Part III and if such a law is made, it shall be void to the extent to 
which it curtails any such right. 
The word ‗law‘ according to the definition given in Article 13 itself includes— 
―... any Ordinance, order, bye-law, rule, regulation, notification, custom or usage 
having in the territory of India, the force of law.‖ 
It is clear that like definition of State in Article 12, the definition of ‗law‘ in Article 
13 is not exhaustive, e.g. it does not speak of even laws made by Parliament or State 
Legislatures which form the largest part of the body of laws. Because of this nature of 
the definition, the issue came up before the Supreme Court as to whether a 
Constitutional Amendment by which a fundamental right included in Part III is taken 
away or abridged is also a law within the meaning of Article 13. The Court twice 
rejected the view that it includes a Constitutional Amendment, but third time in the 
famous Golaknath case (A.I.R. 1967 S.C. 1643) by a majority of 6 to 5, the Court took 
the view that it includes such an amendment and, therefore, even a Constitutional 
amendment would be void to the extent it takes away or abridges any of the 
 
EP-GCL-1 
9
fundamental rights. By the Constitution (Twenty-Fourth Amendment) Act, 1971 a new 
clause has been added to Article 13 which provides that— 
―Nothing in this Article shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution made 
under Article 368‖ 
Article 13 came up for judicial review in a number of cases and the Courts have 
evolved doctrines like doctrine of eclipse, severability, prospective overruling, 
acquiescence etc. for interpreting the provisions of Article 13. 
Doctrine of Severability 
One thing to be noted in Article 13 is that, it is not the entire law which is affected 
by the provisions in Part III, but on the other hand, the law becomes invalid only to 
the extent to which it is inconsistent with the Fundamental Rights. So only that part of 
the law will be declared invalid which is inconsistent, and the rest of the law will 
stand. However, on this point a clarification has been made by the Courts that invalid 
part of the law shall be severed and declared invalid if really it is severable, i.e., if 
after separating the invalid part the valid part is capable of giving effect to the 
legislature‘s intent, then only it will survive, otherwise the Court shall declare the 
entire law as invalid. This is known as the rule of severability. 
The doctrine has been applied invariably to cases where it has been found 
possible to separate the invalid part from the valid part of an Act. Article 13 only says 
that any law which is inconsistent with the fundamental rights is void ―to the extent of 
inconsistency‖ and this has been interpreted to imply that it is not necessary to strike 
down the whole Act as invalid, if only a part is invalid and that part can survive 
independently. In A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras, A.I.R.1950 S.C. 27, the Supreme 
Court ruled that where an Act was partly invalid, if the valid portion was severable 
from the rest, the valid portion would be maintained, provided that it was sufficient to 
carry out the purpose of the Act. 
From above, it is clear that this doctrine applies only to pre constitutional laws as 
according to Article 13(2), State cannot even make any law which is contrary to the 
provisions of this Part. 
Doctrine of Eclipse 
The another noteworthy thing in Article 13 is that, though an existing law 
inconsistent with a fundamental right becomes in-operative from the date of the 
commencement of the Constitution, yet it is not dead altogether. A law made before 
the commencement of the Constitution remains eclipsed or dormant to the extent it 
comes under the shadow of the fundamental rights, i.e. is inconsistent with it, but the 
eclipsed or dormant parts become active and effective again if the prohibition brought 
about by the fundamental rights is removed by the amendment of the Constitution. 
This is known as the doctrine of eclipse. 
The doctrine was first evolved in Bhikaji Narain Dhakras v. 
State of M.P., A.I.R. 1955 S.C. 781. In this case, the validity 
of C.P. and Berar Motor Vehicles Amendment Act, 1947, 
empowering the Government to regulate, control and to 
take up the entire motor transport business, was 
challenged. The Act was perfectly a valid piece of 
legislation at the time of its enactment. But on the 
EP-GCL-1 
10
commencement of the Constitution, the existing law became inconsistent 
under Article 13(1), as it contravened the freedom to carry on trade and 
business under Article 19(1)(g). To remove the infirmity the Constitution (First 
Amendment) Act, 1951 was passed which permitted creation by law of State 
monopoly in respect of motor transport business. The Court held that the 
Article by reason of its language could not be read as having obliterated the 
entire operation of the inconsistent law or having wiped it altogether from the 
statute book. In case of a pre-Constitution law or statute, it was held, that the 
doctrine of eclipse would apply. The relevant part of the judgement is: 
―The true position is that the impugned law became as it were, eclipsed, for the 
time being, by the fundamental right. The effect of the Constitution (First 
Amendment) Act, 1951 was to remove the shadow and to make the impugned 
Act free from all blemish or infirmity.‖ 
However, there was a dispute regarding the applicability of the doctrine of 
eclipse, whether it should be applicable to both pre-Constitution and post-Constitution 
laws or only to pre-constitution laws. Some decisions were in favour of both laws and 
some were in favour of pre-constitution laws only. There is no unambiguous judicial 
pronouncement to that effect. 
Waiver 
The doctrine of waiver of rights is based on the premise that a person is his best 
judge and that he has the liberty to waive the enjoyment of such rights as are 
conferred on him by the State. However, the person must have the knowledge of his 
rights and that the waiver should be voluntary. The doctine was discussed in 
Basheshar Nath  v. C.I.T., AIR 1959 SC 149,  where  the  majority  expressed  its 
view against the waiver of fundamental rights. It was held that it was not open to 
citizens to waive any of the fundamental rights. Any person aggrieved by the 
consequence of the exercise of any discriminatory power, could be heard to complain 
against it. 
The Article has been invoked in many cases. Some of the important cases and 
observations are as under: 
Single Person Law 
A law may be constitutional, even though it relates to a single individual, if 
that single individual is treated as a class by himself on some peculiar 
circumstances. The case is Charanjit Lal Chowdhary v. Union of India, AIR 1951 
SC 41, in this case, the petitioner was an ordinary shareholder of the Sholapur 
Spinning and Weaving Co. Ltd. The company through its directors had been 
managing and running a textile mill of the same name. Later, on account of 
mis-management, a situation had arisen that brought about the closing down 
of the mill, thus affecting the production of an essential commodity, apart from 
causing serious unemployment amongst certain section of the community. The 
Central Government issued an Ordinance which was later replaced by an Act, 
known as Sholapur Spinning & Weaving Co. (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1950. 
With the passing of this Act, the management and the administration of the 
assets of the company were placed under the control of the directors 
appointed by the Government. As regards the shareholders, the Act declared 
 
EP-GCL-1 
11
that they could neither appoint a new director nor could take proceedings 
against the company for winding up. The petitioner filed a writ petition on the 
ground that the said Act infringed the rule of equal protection of laws as 
embodied in Article 14, because a single company and its shareholders were 
subjected to disability as compared with other companies and their 
shareholders. The Supreme Court dismissed the petition and held the 
legislation as valid. It laid down that the law may be constitutional even though 
it applies to a single individual if on account of some special circumstances or 
reasons applicable to him only, that single individual may be treated as a class 
by himself. However, in subsequent cases the Court explained that the rule of 
presumption laid down in Charanjit Lal’s case is not absolute, but would depend on 
facts of each case. 
For a valid classification there has to be a rational nexus between the 
classification made by the law and the object sought to be achieved. For example a 
provision for district-wise distribution of seats in State Medical colleges on the basis 
of population of a district to the population of the State was held to be void (P. 
Rajandran v. State of Mysore, AIR 1968 SC 1012). 
5.  Right of equality 
Articles 14 to 18 of the Constitution deal with equality and its various 
facets. The general principle finds expression in Article 14. Particular 
applications of this right are dealt with in Articles 15 and 16. Still more 
specialised applications of equality are found in Articles 17 and 18. 
Article 14: Equality before the law and equal protection of the laws 
Article 14 of the Constitution says that ―the State shall not deny to any person 
equality before the law or the  equal  protection of the laws within the territory of 
India‖.  
As is evident, Article 14 guarantees to every person the right to equality before the 
law or the equal protection of the laws. The expression ‗equality before the law‘ which is 
barrowed from English Common Law is a declaration of equality of all persons within 
the territory of India, implying thereby the absence of any special privilege in favour of 
any individual. Every person, whatever be his rank or position is subject to the 
jurisdiction of the ordinary courts.  The second expression ―the equal protection of the 
laws‖ which is based on the last clause of the first section of the Fourteenth 
Amendment to the American Constitution directs that equal protection shall be secured 
to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction of the Union in the enjoyment of their 
rights and privileges without favouritism or discrimination. Article 14 applies to all 
persons and is not limited to citizens. A corporation, which is a juristic person, is also 
entitled to the benefit of this Article (Chiranjit Lal Chowdhurary v. Union of India, AIR 
1951 SC 41). The right to equality is also recognised as one of the basic features of the 
Constitution ( Indra Sawhney v. Union of India, AIR 2000 SC 498). 
As a matter of fact all persons are not alike or equal in all respects. Application of 
the same laws uniformly to all of them will, therefore, be inconsistent with the 
principle of equality.  Of course, mathematical equality is not intended. Equals are to 
EP-GCL-1 
12
be governed by the same laws. But as regards unequals, the same laws are not 
complemented. In fact, that would itself lead to inequality. 
Equality is a comparative concept. A person is treated unequally only if that 
person is treated worse than others, and those others (the comparison group) must 
be those who are ‗similarly situated‘ to the complainant. (Glanrock Estate (P) Ltd. v. 
State of T N (2010) 10 SCC 96) 
Legislative classification 
A right conferred on persons that they shall not be denied equal protection of the 
laws does not mean the protection of the same laws for all. It is here that the doctrine 
of classification steps in and gives content and significance to the guarantee of the 
equal protection of the laws. To separate persons similarly situated from those who 
are not, legislative classification or distinction is made carefully between persons who 
are and who are not similarly situated. The Supreme Court in a number of cases has 
upheld the view that Article 14 does not rule out classification for purposes of 
legislation. Article 14 does not forbid classification or differentiation which rests upon 
reasonable grounds of distinction. 
The Supreme Court in State of Bihar v. Bihar State ‘Plus-2’ lectures Associations, 
(2008) 7 SCC 231 held that now it is well settled and cannot be disputed that Article 
14 of the Constitution guarantees equality before the law and confers equal 
protection of laws. It prohibits the state from denying persons or class of persons 
equal treatment; provided they are equals and are similarly situated. It however, does 
not forbid classification. In other words, what Article 14 prohibits is discrimination and 
not classification if otherwise such classification is legal, valid and reasonable. 
Test of valid classification 
Since a distinction is to be made for the purpose of enacting a legislation, it must 
pass the classical test enunciated by the Supreme Court in State of West Bengal v. 
Anwar Ali Sarkar, AIR 1952 SC 75. Permissible classification must satisfy two 
conditions, namely; (i) it must be founded on an intelligible differentia which 
distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the 
group; and (ii) the differentia must have a rational nexus with the object sought to be 
achieved by the statute in question. 
After considering leading cases on equal protection clause enshrined in Article 14 
of the constitution, the five-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Confederation of 
Ex-Servicemen Assns. v. Union of India, (2006) 8 SCC 399 stated: ―In our judgement, 
therefore, it is clear that every classification to be legal, valid and permissible, must 
fulfill the twin test; namely : 
 
(i) the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which must 
distinguish persons or things that are grouped together from others leaving 
out or left out; and 
 (ii) Such a differentia must have rational nexus to the object sought to be 
achieved by the statute or legislation in question‖. 
The classification may be founded on different basis, such as, geographical, or 
according to objects or occupation or the like. What is necessary is that there must be a 
nexus between the basis of classification and the object of the Act under consideration. 
 
EP-GCL-1 
13
A legal and valid classification may be based on educational qualifications (State of 
Bihar v. Bihar State ‘Plus-2’ lecturers Associations and Others, (2008) 7 SCC 238) 
A law based on a permissible classification fulfills the guarantee of the equal 
protection of the laws and is valid. On the other hand if it is based on an impermissible 
classification it violates that guarantee and is void.  Reiterating the test of reasonable 
classification, the Supreme Court in Dharam Dutt v. Union of India, (2004) 1 SCC 712 
held that laying down of intelligible differentia does not, however mean that the 
legislative classification should be scientifically perfect or logically complete. 
Scope of Article 14 
The true meaning and scope of Article 14 has been explained in several 
decisions of the Supreme Court. The rules with respect to permissible 
classification as evolved in the various decisions have been summarised by 
the Supreme Court in Ram Kishan Dalmiya v. Justice Tendulkar, AIR 1958 SC, 
538 as follows: 
 
(i) Article 14 forbids class legislation, but does not 
forbid classification. 
 
(ii) Permissible 
classification 
must 
satisfy 
two 
conditions, namely, (a) it must be founded on an intelligible 
differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are 
grouped together from others left out of the group, and (b) 
the differentia must have a relation to the object sought to be achieved 
by the statute in question. 
 (iii) The classification may be founded on different basis, namely 
geographical, or according to objects or occupations or the like. 
 (iv) In permissible classification, mathematical nicety and perfect equality 
are not required. Similarly, non identity of treatment is enough. 
 (v) Even a single individual may be treated a class by himself on account 
of some special circumstances or reasons applicable to him and not 
applicable to others; a law may be constitutional even though it relates 
to a single individual who is in a class by himself. 
 (vi) Article 14 condemns discrimination not only by substantive law but by 
a law of procedure. 
 (vii) There is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of an 
enactment and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there 
has been a clear transgression of the constitutional principles. 
A remarkable example of the application of the principle of equality under the 
Constitution is the decision of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in R.K. 
Garg v. Union of India, AIR 1976 SC 1559. The legislation under attack was the 
Special Bearer Bonds (Immunities and Exemptions) Act, 1981. It permitted 
investment of black money in the purchase of these Bonds without any questions 
being asked as to how this money came into the possession. 
In a public interest litigation it was contended that Article 14 had been violated, 
because honest tax payers were adversely discriminated against by the Act, which 
EP-GCL-1 
14
legalized evasion. But the Supreme Court rejected the challenge, taking note of the 
magnitude of the problem of black money which had brought into being a parallel 
economy. 
Finally it should be mentioned that Article 14 invalidates discrimination not only in 
substantive law but also in procedure. Further, it applies to executive acts also. 
In the recent past, Article 14 has acquired new dimensions. In Maneka Gandhi v. 
Union of India, AIR 1978 SC 597, the Supreme Court held that Article 14 strikes at 
arbitrariness in State action and ensures a fairness and equality of treatment. The 
principle of reasonableness, which logically as well as philosophically, is an essential 
element of equality or non-arbitrariness pervades Article 14 like a brooding 
omnipresence (See also Ramana  Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority, 
AIR 1979 SC 1628; Kasturi Lal v. State of J&K, AIR 1980 SC 1992).  In Ajay Hasia v. 
Khalid  Mujib, AIR 1981SC 487, the Supreme Court held ― …. what Article 14 strikes 
at is arbitrariness because an action that is arbitrary must necessarily involve 
negation of equality….. Wherever therefore there is arbitrariness in State action 
whether it be of the legislature or of the executive or of an ―authority‖ under Article 12, 
Article 14 immediately springs into action and strikes down such action.‖  In this case 
the system of selection by oral interview, in addition to written test was upheld as 
valid, but allocation of above 15 per cent of the total marks for interview was regarded 
as arbitrary and unreasonable and liable to be struck down as constitutionally invalid. 
Possession of higher qualification can be treated as a valid base or classification 
of two categories of employees, even if no such requirement is prescribed at the time 
of recruitment.  If such a distinction is drawn no complaint can be made that it would 
violate Article 14 of the Constitution (U.P. State Sugar Corpn. Ltd. v. Sant Raj Singh, 
(2006) 9 SCC 82. 
In Secy., State of Karnataka v. Umadevi, (2006) 4 SCC 1, the Supreme Court 
has held that adherence to the rule of equality in public employment is a basic feature 
of our Constitution and since the rule of law is the core of our Constitution, a court 
would certainly be disabled from passing an order upholding the violation of Article 
14. 
Article 15: Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion etc. 
Article 15(1) prohibits the State from discriminating against any citizen on 
grounds only of: 
 (a) religion 
 (b) race 
 (c) caste 
 (d) sex 
 (e) place of birth or 
 
(f) any of them 
Article 15(2) lays down that no citizen shall be subjected to any disability, 
restriction or condition with regard to— 
 (a) access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of public 
entertainment; or 
 
EP-GCL-1 
15
 (b) the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places of public resort, 
maintained wholly or partially out of State funds or dedicated to the use of the 
general public. 
Article 15(3) and 15(4) create certain exceptions to the right guaranteed by 
Article 15(1) and 15(2). Under Article 15(3) the State can make special provision for 
women and children. It is under this provision that courts have upheld the validity of 
legislation or executive orders discriminating in favour of women (Union of India v. 
Prabhakaran, (1997) 2 SCC 633). 
Article 15(4) permits the State to make special provision for the advancement 
of— 
 (a) Socially and educationally backward classes of citizens; 
 (b) Scheduled casts; and 
 (c) Scheduled tribes. 
Article 16: Equality of opportunity in matters of public employment. 
Article 16(1) guarantees to all citizens equality of opportunity in matters relating 
to employment or appointment of office under the State. 
Article 16(2) prohibits discrimination against a citizen on the grounds of religion, 
race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth or residence. 
However, there are certain exceptions provided in Article 16(3), 16(4) and 16(5). 
These are as under: 
 (1) Parliament can make a law that in regard to a class or classes of 
employment or appointment to an office under the Government of a State on 
a Union Territory, under any local or other authority within the State or Union 
Territory, residence within that State or Union Territory prior to such 
employment or appointment shall be an essential qualification. [Article 16(3)] 
 (2) A provision can be made for the reservation of appointments or posts in 
favour of any backward class of citizens which in the opinion of the State is 
not adequately represented in the services under the State. [Article 16(4)] 
 (3) A law shall not be invalid if it provides that the incumbent of an office in 
connection with the affair of any religious or denominational institution or any 
member of the governing body thereof shall be a person professing a 
particular religion or belonging to a particular denomination. [Article 16(5)] 
The Supreme Court in Secy. of State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3) (2006) 4 
SCC 1 held that adherence to the rule of equality in public employment is a 
basic feature of the Constitution and since the rule of law is the core of the 
Constitution, a Court would certainly be disabled from passing an order 
upholding a violation of Article 14. Equality of opportunity is the hallmark and 
the Constitution has provided also for affirmative action to ensure that 
unequals are not treated as equals. Thus any public employment has to be in 
terms of the Constitutional Scheme.

As per The Declaration of American Independence 1776, which of 
the following rights are endowed by the creator on all men? 
 (a) Life 
 (b) Liberty  
 (c) Virtue 
 (d) Pursuit of happiness 
Correct answer: a, b, and d 
 
Article 17: Abolition of untouchability 
Article 17 says that ―Untouchability‖ is abolished and its practice in any form is 
forbidden. The enforcement of any disability arising out of ―Untouchability‖ shall be an 
offence punishable in accordance with law. 
Untouchability does not include an instigation to social boycott (Davarajiah v. 
Padamanna, AIR 1961 Mad. 35, 39). Punishment for violation of Article 17 is to be 
provided by Parliament under Article 35(a)(ii).  
In 1955 Parliament enacted the Untouchability (Offences) Act 1955. In 1976, the 
Act was amended and renamed as the ―Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955‖ making 
changes in the existing law namely, all offences to be treated as non-compoundable 
and offences punishable upto three months to be tried summarily; punishment of 
offences enhanced; preaching of untouchability or its justification made an offence; a 
machinery envisaged for better administration and enforcement of its provisions. 
Article 18: Abolition of titles 
Article 18 is more a prohibition rather than a fundamental right. British 
Government used to confer titles upon persons who showed special allegiance to 
them. Many persons were made Sir, Raj Bahadur, Rai Saheb, Knight, etc. These 
titles had the effect of creating a class of certain persons which was regarded 
superior to others and thus had the effect of perpetuating inequality. To do away with 
that practice, now Article 18 provides as under: 
 
(i) No title, not being a military or academic distinction, shall be conferred by the 
State. 
 (ii) No citizen of India shall accept any title from any foreign State. 
 (iii) No person, who is not a citizen of India shall, while he holds any office or 
trust under the State, accept without the consent of the President, any title 
from any foreign State. 
 (iv) No person, holding any office of profit or trust under State shall without the 
consent of the President, accept any present, emolument or office of any kind 
from or under a foreign State. 
 
EP-GCL-1 
17
It has been pointed out by the Supreme Court that the framers of the Constitution 
prohibited titles of nobility and all other titles that carry suffixes or prefixes, as they 
result in the distinct class of citizens. However, framers of the Constitution did not 
intend that the State should not officially recognise merit or work of an extra ordinary 
nature. The National awards are not violative of the principles of equality as 
guaranteed by the provisions of the Constitution. The theory of equality does not 
mandate that merit should not be recognised. The Court has held that the National 
awards do not amount to "titles" within the meaning of Article 18(1) and they should 
not be used as suffixes or prefixes. If this is done, the defaulter should forfeit the 
National award conferred on him/her, following the procedure laid down in regulation 
10 of each of the four notifications creating these National awards. 
6.  Rights Relating to Freedom 
Articles 19-22 guarantee certain fundamental freedoms. 
The six freedoms of citizens 
Article 19(1), of the Constitution, guarantees to the citizens of 
India six freedoms, namely: 
 
(a) freedom of speech and expression; 
 (b) assemble peaceably and without arms; 
 (c) form associations or unions 
 (d) move freely, throughout the territory of India; 
 (e) reside and settle in any part of the territory of India; 
 
(f) practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. 
These freedoms are those great and basic rights which are recognized as the 
natural rights inherent in the status of a citizen. At the same time, none of these 
freedoms is absolute but subject to reasonable restrictions specified under clauses 
(2) to (6) of the Article 19. The Constitution under Articles 19(2) to 19(6) permits the 
imposition of restrictions on these freedoms subject to the following conditions: 
 (a) The restriction can be imposed by law and not by a purely executive order 
issued under a statute; 
 (b) The restriction must be reasonable; 
 (c) The restriction must be imposed for achieving one or more of the objects 
specified in the respective clauses of Article 19. 
Reasonableness 
It is very important to note that the restrictions should be reasonable. If this word 
‗reasonable‘ is not there, the Government can impose any restrictions and they 
cannot be challenged. This word alone gives the right to an aggrieved person to 
challenge any restriction of the freedoms granted under this Article. 
Reasonableness of the restriction is an ingredient common to all the clauses of 
Article 19. Reasonableness is an objective test to be applied by the judiciary. 
Legislative judgment may be taken into account by the Court, but it is not conclusive.  
EP-GCL-1 
18
It is subject to the supervision of Courts.  The following factors are usually considered 
to assess the reasonableness of a law: 
 
(i) The objective of the restriction; 
 (ii) The nature, extent and urgency of the evil sought to be dealt with by the law 
in question; 
 (iii) How far the restriction is proportion to the evil in question 
 (iv) Duration of the restriction 
 (v) The conditions prevailing at the time when the law was framed. 
The onus of proving to the satisfaction of the Court that the restriction is 
reasonable is upon the State. 
Procedural and Substantiveness 
In determining the reasonableness of a law, the Court will not only see the 
surrounding circumstances, but all contemporaneous legislation passed as part of a 
single scheme. It is the reasonableness of the restriction and not of the law that has 
to be found out, and if the legislature imposes a restriction by one law but creates 
countervailing advantages by another law passed as part of the same legislative plan, 
the court can take judicial notice of such Acts forming part of the same legislative 
plan (Krishna Sagar Mills v. Union of India, AIR 1959 SC 316). 
The phrase ‗reasonable restrictions‘ connotes that the limitation imposed upon a 
person in the enjoyment of a right should not be arbitrary or of an excessive nature. 
In determining the reasonableness of a statute, the Court would see both the nature 
of the restriction and procedure prescribed by the statute for enforcing the restriction 
on the individual freedom. The reasonableness of a restriction has to be determined 
in an objective manner and from the point of view of the interests of the general 
public and not from the point of view of the persons upon whom the restrictions are 
imposed or upon abstract considerations. The Court is called upon to ascertain the 
reasonableness of the restrictions and not of the law which permits the restriction. 
The word ‗restriction‘ also includes cases of prohibition and the State can establish 
that a law, though purporting to deprive a person of his fundamental right, under 
certain circumstances amounts to a reasonable restriction only. Though the test of 
reasonableness laid down in clauses (2) to (6) of Article 19 might in great part 
coincide with that for judging ‗due process‘ under the American Constitution, it must 
not be assumed that these are identical. It has been held that the restrictions are 
imposed in carrying out the Directive Principles of State Policy is a point in favour of 
the reasonableness of the restrictions. 
Scope and Limitations on the Freedoms 
(a)  Right to freedom of speech and expression 
It need not to be mentioned as to how important the freedom of speech and 
expression in a democracy is. A democratic Government attaches a great importance 
to this freedom because without freedom of speech and expression the appeal to 
reason which is the basis of democracy cannot be made. The right to speech and 
expression includes right to make a good or bad speech and even the right of not to 
speak. One may express oneself even by signs. The Courts have held that this right 
 
EP-GCL-1 
19
includes the freedom of press and right to publish one‘s opinion, right to circulation 
and propagation of one‘s ideas, freedom of peaceful demonstration, dramatic 
performance and cinematography. It may also include any other mode of expression 
of one‘s ideas. The Supreme Court in Cricket Association of Bengal v. Ministry 
of Information & Broadcasting (Govt. of India), AIR 1995 SC 1236, has held that 
this freedom includes the right to communicate through any media - print, 
electronic and audio visual. 
The freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) means the right to 
express one‘s convictions and opinions freely by word of mouth, writing, printing, 
pictures or any other mode. This freedom includes the freedom of press as it 
partakes of the same basic nature and characteristic (Maneka Gandhi v. Union of 
India, AIR 1978 S.C. 597). However no special privilege is attached to the press as 
such, distinct from ordinary citizens. In Romesh Thapar v. State of Punjab, AIR 1950 
S.C. 124, it was observed that ―freedom of speech and of the press lay at the 
foundation of all democratic organisations, for without free political discussion no 
public education, so essential for the proper functioning of the process of popular 
Government is possible‖. Imposition of pre-censorship on publication under clause 
(2), is violative of freedom of speech and expression.  
The right to freedom of speech is infringed not only by a direct ban on the 
circulation of a publication but also by an action of the Government which would 
adversely affect the circulation of the paper. The only restrictions which may be 
imposed on the press are those which clause (2) of Article 19 permits and no other 
(Sakal Papers (P) Ltd. v. Union of India, AIR 1962 SC 305). 
Regarding Commercial advertisements it was held in Hamdard Dawakhana v. 
Union of India, AIR 1960 SC 554 that they do not fall within the protection of 
freedom of speech and expression because such advertisements have an 
element of trade and commerce. A commercial advertisement does not aim at 
the furtherance of the freedom of speech. Later the perception about 
advertisement changed and it has been held that commercial speech is a part 
of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) and 
such speech can also be subjected to reasonable restrictions only under 
Article 19(2) and not otherwise (Tata Press Ltd. v. MTNL, AIR 1995 SC 2438). 
The right to know, ‗receive and impart information‘ has been recognized within 
the right to freedom of speech and expression (S.P. Gupta v. President of India,  AIR 
1982 SC 149. A citizen has a fundamental right to use the best means of imparting 
and receiving information and as such to have an access to telecasting for the 
purpose. (Secretary, Ministry of I&B, Govt. of India v. Cricket Association of Bengal, 
(1995) 2 SCC 161) 
The right to reply, i.e. the right to get published one‘s reply in the same news 
media in which something is published against or in relation to a person has also 
been recognised under Article 19(1)(a), particularly when the news media is owned 
by the State within the meaning of Article 12. It has also been held that a Government 
circular having no legal sanction violates Article 19(1)(a), if it compels each and every 
pupil to join in the singing of the National Anthem despite his genuine, conscientious 
religious objection (Bijoe Emmanuel v. State of Kerala, (1986) 3 SCC 615). Impliedly 
the Court has recognised in Article 19(1)(a) the right to remain silent.  
EP-GCL-1 
20
The Supreme Court in Union of India v. Naveen Jindal, 
(2004) 2 SCC 476, has held that right to fly the National Flag 
freely with respect and dignity is a fundamental right of a 
citizen within the meaning of Article 19(1)(a) of the 
Constitution being an expression and manifestation of his 
allegiance and feelings and sentiments of pride for the 
nation.  
Dramatic performance is also a form of speech and expression. In K.A. Abbas v. 
Union of India, AIR 1971 S.C. 481, the Court held that censorship of films including 
(pre-censorship) is justified under Article 19(1)(a) and (2) of the Constitution but the 
restrictions must be reasonable. The right of a citizen to exhibit films on the 
Doordarshan subject to the terms and conditions to be imposed by the latter has also 
been recognized. (Odyssey Communications (P) Ltd. v. Lokvidayan Sangathan, AIR 
1988 SC 1642. 
Clause (2) of Article 19 specifies the limits upto which the freedom of speech and 
expression may be restricted. It enables the Legislature to impose by law reasonable 
restrictions on the freedom of speech and expression under the following heads: 
Permissible Restrictions  
 (1) Sovereignty and integrity of India. 
 (2) Security of the State. 
 (3) Friendly relations with foreign States. 
 (4) Public Order. 
 (5) Decency or morality or 
 (6) Contempt of court. 
 (7) Defamation or 
 (8) Incitement to an offence. 
Reasonable restrictions under these heads can be imposed only by a duly 
enacted law and not by the executive action (Express News Papers Pvt. Ltd. v. Union 
of India, (1986) 1 SCC 133). 
Corporations 
The Supreme Court, initially expressed the view that a Corporation is not a 
citizen within the meaning of Article 19 and, therefore, cannot invoke this Article. 
Subsequently the Supreme Court held that a company is a distinct and separate 
entity from its shareholders and refused to tear the corporate veil for determing the 
constitutionality of the legislation by judging its impact on the fundamental rights of 
the shareholders of the company (TELCO v. State of Bihar, AIR 1965 S.C. 40). But a 
significant modification is made by the Supreme Court in R.C. Cooper v. Union of 
India, AIR 1970 S.C. 564 (also called the Bank Nationalisation case). The Supreme 
Court ruled that the test in determining whether the shareholder‘s right is impaired is 
not formal but is essentially qualitative. If the State action impaired the rights of the 
shareholders as well as of the company, the Court will not deny itself jurisdiction to 
grant relief. The shareholders‘ rights are equally affected, if the rights of the company 
are affected (Bennett Coleman & Co., AIR (1973) S.C. 106).

(b)  Freedom of assembly 
The next right is the right of citizens to assemble peacefully and without arms 
[Art. 19(1)(b)].  Calling an assembly and putting one‘s views before it is also 
intermixed with the right to speech and expression discussed above, and in a 
democracy it is of no less importance than speech. However, apart from the fact that 
the assembly must be peaceful and without arms, the State is also authorised to 
impose reasonable restrictions on this right in the interests of: 
 
(i) the sovereignty and integrity of India, or 
 (ii) public order. 
Freedom of assembly is an essential element in a democratic Government. In the 
words of Chief Justice Waite of the Supreme Court of America, ―the very idea of 
Government, republican in form, implies a right on the part of citizens to meet 
peaceably for consultation in respect of public affairs‖. The purpose of public 
meetings being the education of the public and the formation of opinion on religious, 
social, economic and political matters, the right of assembly has a close affinity to 
that of free speech under Article 19(1)(a). 
(c)  Freedom of association 
The freedom of association includes freedom to hold meeting and to takeout 
processions without arms. Right to form associations for unions is also guaranteed so 
that people are free to have the members entertaining similar views [Art. 19(1)(c)]. 
This right is also, however, subject to reasonable restrictions which the State may 
impose in the interests of: 
 
(i) the sovereignty and integrity of India, or 
 (ii) public order, or 
 (iii) morality. 
A question not yet free from doubt is whether the fundamental right to form 
association also conveys the freedom to deny to form an association. In Tikaramji v. 
Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1956 SC 676, the Supreme Court observed that assuming 
the right to form an association “implies a right not to form an association, it 
does not follow that the negative right must also be regarded as a fundamental 
right”. However, the High Court of Andhra Pradesh has held, that this right 
necessarily implies a right not to be a member of an association. Hence, the rules 
which made it compulsory for all teachers of elementary schools to become members 
of an association were held to be void as being violative of Article 19(1)(c) 
(Sitharamachary v. Sr. Dy. Inspector of Schools, AIR 1958 A.P. 78). This view gets 
support from O.K. Ghosh v. Joseph, AIR 1963 SC 812.  It has been held that a right 
to form associations or unions does not include within its ken as a fundamental right a 
right to form associations or unions for achieving a particular object or running a 
particular institution (2004) 1 SCC 712. 
(d)  Freedom of movement 
Right to move freely throughout the territory of India is another right guaranteed 
under Article 19(1)(d). This right, however, does not extend to travel abroad, and like 
EP-GCL-1 
22
other rights stated above, it is also subject to the reasonable restrictions which the 
State may impose: 
 
(i) in the interests of the general public, or 
 (ii) for the protection of the interests of any scheduled tribe. 
A law authorising externment or interment to be valid must fall within the limits of 
permissible legislation in clause (5), namely restrictions must be reasonable and in 
the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of the 
Scheduled Tribes. 
(e)  Freedom of residence 
Article 19(1)(e) guarantees to a citizen the right to reside and settle in any part of 
the territory of India. This right overlaps the right guaranteed by clause (d). This 
freedom is said to be intended to remove internal barriers within the territory of India 
to enable every citizen to travel freely and settle down in any part of a State or Union 
territory. This freedom is also subject to reasonable restrictions in the interests of 
general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe under 
Article 19(5). That apart, citizens can be subjected to reasonable restrictions 
(Ebrahim v. State of Bom., (1954) SCR 923, 950). Besides this, certain areas may be 
banned for certain kinds of persons such as prostitutes (State of U.P. v. Kaushaliya, 
AIR 1964 SC 416, 423). 
[(f) Right to acquire, hold and dispose of property — deleted by 44th 
Amendment in 1978.] 
(g)  Freedom to trade and occupations 
Article 19(1)(g) provides that all citizens shall have the right to practise any 
profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. 
An analysis of the case law reveals that the emphasis of the Courts has been on 
social control and social policy. However, no hard and fast rules have been laid down 
by the Court for interpreting this Article. The words ‘trade’, ‘business’, ‘profession’ 
used in this Article have received a variety of interpretations. The word ‗trade‘ has 
been held to include the occupation of men in buying and selling, barter or 
commerce, work, especially skilled, thus of the widest scope (Safdarjung Hospital v. 
K.S. Sethi, AIR 1970 S.C. 1407). 
The word ‗business‘ is more comprehensive than the word ‗trade‘. Each case 
must be decided according to its own circumstances, applying the common sense 
principle as to what business is. A profession on the other hand, has been held 
ordinarily as an occupation requiring intellectual skill, often coupled with manual skill. 
Like other freedoms discussed above, this freedom is also subject to reasonable 
restrictions. Article 19(6) provides as under : 
Nothing in sub-clause (g) shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as 
it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, in the interests of the 
general public, reasonable restrictions in the exercise of the right conferred by the 
said sub-clause, and in particular, nothing in the said sub-clause shall affect the 
operation of any existing law in so far as it relates to, or prevent the State from 
 
EP-GCL-1 
23
making any law relating to— 
 
(i) the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any 
profession or carrying on any occupation, trade or business, or 
 (ii) the carrying on by the State, or by a corporation owned or controlled by the 
State, of any trade, industry or service whether to the exclusion, complete or 
partial, of citizens or otherwise. 
Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution guarantees that all citizens have the right to 
practice any profession or to carry on any occupation or trade or business. The 
freedom is not uncontrolled, for, clause (6) of the Article authorises legislation which 
(i) imposes reasonable restrctions on this freedom in the interests of the general 
public; (ii) prescribes professional or technical qualifications necessary for carrying on 
any profession, trade or business; and (iii) enables the State to carry on any trade or 
business to the exclusion of private citizens, wholly or partially. 
In order to determine the reasonableness of the restriction, regard must be had to 
the nature of the business and conditions prevailing in that trade. It is obvious that 
these factors differ from trade to trade, and no hard and fast rules concerning all 
trades can be laid down. The word ‗restriction‘ used in clause (6) is wide enough to 
include cases of total prohibition also. Accordingly, even if the effect of a law is the 
elimination of the dealers from the trade, the law may be valid, provided it satisfies 
the test of reasonableness or otherwise. 
The vital principle which has to kept in mind is that the restrictive law should 
strike a proper balance between the freedom guaranteed under Article 19(1)(g) and 
the social control permitted by clause (6) of Article 19. The restriction must not be of 
an exessive nature beyond what is required in the interests of the public. 
Monopoly 
The Supreme Court‟s decision in Chintamana Rao v. State of M.P., AIR 1951 
S.C. 118 is a leading case on the point where the constitutionality of Madhya 
Pradesh Act was challenged. The State law prohibited the manufacture of bidis 
in the villages during the agricultural season. No person 
residing in the village could employ any other person nor 
engage himself, in the manufacture of bidis during the 
agricultural season. The object of the provision was to 
ensure adequate supply of labour for agricultural purposes. 
The bidi manufacturer could not even import labour from 
outside, and so, had to suspend manufacture of bidis during 
the agricultural season. Even villagers incapable of engaging in agriculture, 
like old people, women and children, etc., who supplemented their income by 
engaging themselves manufacturing bidis were prohibited without any reason. 
The prohibition was held to be unreasonable. 
However, after the Constitutional (Amendment) Act, 1951, the State can create a 
monopoly in favour of itself and can compete with private traders. It has been held in 
Assn. of Registration Plates v. Union of India, (2004) SCC 476 that the State is free 
to create monopoly in favour of itself. However the entire benefit arising therefrom 
must ensure to the benefit of the State and should not be used as a clock for 
conferring private benefit upon a limited class of persons. 
EP-GCL-1 
24
(a)  Protection in respect of conviction for offences 
Articles 20, 21 and 22 provide a system of protection,  relevant to the 
criminal law. Article 20 guarantees to all persons — whether citizens 
or non-citizens-three rights namely:— 
(i)  Protection against ex-post facto laws 
According to Article 20(1), no person shall be convicted of any 
offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act 
charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might 
have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the 
offence. 
Ex-post facto laws are laws which punished what had been lawful when done. If 
a particular act was not an offence according to the law of the land at the time when 
the person did that act, then he cannot be convicted under a law which with 
retrospective declares that act as an offence. For example, what was not an offence 
in 1972 cannot be declared as an offence under a law made in 1974 giving operation 
to such law from a back date, say from 1972. 
Even the penalty for the commission of an offence cannot be increased with 
retrospective effect. For example, suppose for committing dacoity the penalty in 1970 
was 10 years imprisonment and a person commits dacoity in that year. By a law 
passed after his committing the dacoity the penalty, for his act cannot be increased 
from 10 to 11 years or to life imprisonment. 
In Shiv Bahadur Singh v. State of Vindhya Pradesh, AIR 1953 S.C. 394, it was 
clarified that Article 20(1) prohibited the conviction under an ex post facto law, and 
that too the substantive law. This protection is not available with respect to procedural 
law. Thus, no one has a vested right in procedure. A law which nullifies the rigour of 
criminal law is not affected by the rule against ex post facto law (Rattan Lal v. State of 
Punjab, (1964) 7 S.C.R. 676). 
(ii)  Protection against double jeopardy 
According to Article 20(2), no person shall be prosecuted and punished for the 
same offence more than once. It is, however, to be noted that the conjunction "and" is 
used between the words prosecuted and punished, and therefore, if a person has 
been let off after prosecution without being punished, he can be prosecuted again. 
(iii)  Protection against self-incrimination 
According to Article 20(3), no person accused of any offence shall be compelled 
to be a witness against himself. In other words, an accused cannot be compelled to 
state anything which goes against him. But it is to be noted that a person is entitled to 
this protection, only when all the three conditions are fulfilled: 
 
1. that he must be accused of an offence; 
 
2. that there must be a compulsion to be a witness; and 
 
3. such compulsion should result in his giving evidence against himself. 
So, if the person was not an accused when he made a statement or the 
statement was not made as a witness or it was made by him without compulsion and 
does not result as a statement against himself, then the protection available under 
this provision does not extend to such person or to such statement. 
 
EP-GCL-1 
25
The ‗right against self-incrimination‘ protects persons who have been formally 
accused as well as those who are examined as suspects in criminal cases. It also 
extends to cover witnesses who apprehend that their answers could expose them to 
criminal charges in the ongoing investigation or even in cases other than the one 
being investigated. [Selvi v. State of Karnataka, AIR 2010 SC 1974]. 
(b)  Protection of life and personal liberty 
Article 21 confers on every person the fundamental right to life and personal 
liberty. It says that, 
―No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to 
procedure established by law.‖ 
The right to life includes those things which make life meaningful. For example, 
the right of a couple to adopt a son is a constitutional right guaranteed under Article 
21 of the Constitution (see, Philips Alfred Malvin v. Y.J. Gonsalvis and others, AIR 
1999 Ker. 187). The right to life enshrined in Article 21 guarantees right to live with 
human dignity. Right to live in freedom from noise pollution is a fundamental right 
protected by Article 21 and noise pollution beyond permissible limits is an inroad into 
that right. (Noise Pollution (v), in re, (2005) 5 SCC 733.  
The majority in the case of A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras, AIR 1950 SC 
27, gave a narrow meaning to the expression „personal liberty‟ within the 
subject matter of Articles 20 to 22 by confining it to the liberty of the person 
(that is, of the body of a person). The majority of the judges also took a narrow 
view of the expression ‘procedure established by law’ in this case. In the State 
of Maharashtra v. Prabhakar Pandurang Sanzigri, AIR 1966, SC 424, Subba Rao 
J. considered the inter-relation between Articles 19 and 21 as was discussed by 
the majority Judges in the A.K. Gopalan’s case and came to the conclusion that 
“that view was not the last word on the subject”. 
The expression ‗liberty‘ in the 5th and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution 
has been given a very wide meaning. The restricted interpretation of the expression 
‗personal liberty‘ preferred by the majority judgement in A.K. Gopalan’s case namely, 
that the expression ‗personal liberty‘ means only liberty relating to or concerning the 
person or body of the individual, has not been accepted by the Supreme Court in 
subsequent cases. 
That the expression „personal liberty‟ is not limited to 
bodily restraint or to confinement to prison, only is well 
illustrated in Kharak Singh v. State of U.P, AIR 1963 SC 
1295. In that case the question raised was of the validity of 
the police regulations authorising the police to conduct 
what are called as domiciliary visits against bad characters 
and to have surveillance over them. The court held that 
such visits were an invasion, on the part of the police, of the 
sanctity of a man‟s home and an intrusion into his personal security and his right 
to sleep, and therefore violative of the personal liberty of the individual, unless 
authorised by a valid law. As regards the regulations authorising surveillance 
over the movements of an individual the court was of the view that they were not 
bad, as no right to privacy has been guaranteed in the Constitution.  
EP-GCL-1

However, in Gobind v. State of M.P., AIR 1975 S.C. 1378, Mathew, J. asserted that 
the right to privacy deserves to be examined with care and to be denied only when an 
important countervailing interest is shown to be superior, and observed that this right 
will have to go through a process of case-by-case development. Mathew, J. explained 
that even assuming that the right to personal liberty, the right to move freely throughout 
the territory of India and the freedom of speech create an independent right to privacy 
as emanating from them, the right is not absolute and it must be read subject to 
restrictions on the basis of compelling public interest. 
Refusal of an application to enter a medical college cannot be said to affect 
person‘s personal liberty under Article 21 (State of A.P. v. L. Narendranathan, (1971) 
1 S.C.C. 607). 
In Satwant Singh Sawhney v. A.P.O., New Delhi, AIR 1967 S.C. 1836, it was 
held that right to travel is included within the expression ‗personal liberty‘ and, 
therefore, no person can be deprived of his right to travel, except according to the 
procedure established by law. Since a passport is essential for the enjoyment of that 
right, the denial of a passport amounts to deprivation of personal liberty. In the 
absence of any procedure pescribed by the law of land sustaining the refusal of a 
passport to a person, it‘s refusal amounts to an unauthorised deprivation of personal 
liberty guaranteed by Article 21. This decision was accepted by the Parliament and 
the infirmity was set right by the enactment of the Passports Act, 1967. 
It was stated in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, AIR 1978 S.C. 597, that 
„personal liberty‟ within the meaning of Article 21 includes within its ambit the 
right to go abroad, and no person can be deprived of this 
right except according to procedure prescribed by law. In 
this case, it was clearly laid down that the fundamental 
rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution are not 
distinct and mutually exclusive. Thus, a law depriving a 
person of personal liberty and prescribing a procedure for 
that purpose within the meaning of Article 21 has still to 
stand the test of one or more of fundamental rights conferred by Article 19 
which may be applicable to a given situation. 
Procedure established by law: The expression ‗procedure established by law‘ 
means procedure laid down by statute or procedure prescribed by the law of the 
State. Accordingly, first, there must be a law justifying interference with the person‘s 
life or personal liberty, and secondly, the law should be a valid law, and thirdly, the 
procedure laid down by the law should have been strictly followed. 
The law laid down in A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras, AIR 1950 SC 27, that 
the expression „procedure established by law‟ means only the procedure 
enacted by a law made by the State was held to be incorrect in the Bank 
Nationalisation Case (1970) 1 S.C.C. 248. Subsequently, in Maneka Gandhi's 
case (AIR 1978 SC 49), it was laid down, that the law must now be taken to be 
well settled that Article 21 does not exclude Article 19 and a law prescribing a 
procedure for depriving a person of „personal liberty‟ will have to meet the 
requirements of Article 21 and also of Article 19, as well as of Article 14. 
The procedure must be fair, just and reasonable. It must not be arbitrary fanciful 
or oppressive. An interesting, follow-up of the Maneka Gandhi's case came in a 
series of cases. 
 
EP-GCL-1 
27
In Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR 1980 S.C. 898, it was reiterated that in 
Article 21 the founding fathers recognised the right of the State to deprive a person of 
his life or personal liberty in accordance with fair, just and reasonable procedure 
established by valid law. 
Presently, this term personal liberty extends to variety of matters like right to bail, 
right not to be handcuffed except under very few cases, right to speedy trial, right to 
free legal aid etc. 
7. Article 21A: Right to Education 
This was introduced by the Constitution (Eighty sixth Amendment) Act, 
2002. According to this, the State shall provide free and compulsory 
education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years in such 
manner as the State may, by law, determine. 
 
Protection against arrest and detention 
Although Article 21 does not impose a limitation on the legislature in so far as the 
deprivation of life or personaly liberty is concerned, yet a legislative Act providing for 
such deprivation is subject to the procedureal safeguards provided in Article 22 and if 
it does not provide for any of these safeguards it shall be declared unconstitutional. 
However, Article 22 does not apply uniformly to all persons and makes a distinction 
between: 
 (a) alien enemies, 
 (b) person arrested or detained under preventive detention law, and 
 (c) other persons. 
So far as alien enemies are concerned the article provides no protection to them. 
So far as persons in category (c) are concerned, it provides the following rights 
(These rights are not given to persons detained under preventive detention law). 
 
(i) A person who is arrested cannot be detained in custody unless he has been 
informed, as soon as he may be, of the grounds for such arrest. 
 (ii) Such person shall have the right to consult and to be defended by a legal 
practitioner of his choice. 
 (iii) A person who is arrested and detained must be produced before the nearest 
magistrate within a period of twenty-four hours of such arrest, excluding the 
time of journey. And such a person shall not be detained in custody beyond 
twenty-four hours without the authority of magistrate. 
Preventive Detention 
Preventive detention means detention of a person without trial. The object of 
preventive detention is not to punish a person for having done something but to 
prevent him from doing it. No offence is proved nor any charge formulated and yet a 
person is detained because he is likely to commit an act prohibited by law. Parliament 
has the power to make a law for preventive detention for reasons connected with 
defence, foreign affairs or the security of India. Parliament and State Legislatures are 
both entitled to pass a law of preventive detention for reasons connected with the 
security of State, the maintenance of public order, or the maintenance of supplies and 
services essential to the community.

Safeguards against Preventive Detention 
Article 22 (amended by the 44th Constitution Amendment Act, 1978)1 contains 
following safeguards against preventive detention: 
 (a) such a person cannot be detained for a longer period than three months 
unless: 
 
(i) An Advisory Board constituted of persons who are or have been or are 
qualified to be High Court judges has reported, before the expiration of 
the said period of three months that there is, in its opinion sufficient 
cause for such detention. 
 
(ii) Parliament may by law prescribe the maximum period for which any 
person may in any class or classes of cases be detained under any law 
providing for preventive detention and the procedure to be followed by an 
Advisory Board. 
 (b) The authority ordering the detention of a person under the preventive 
detention law shall: 
 
(i) communicate to him, as soon as may be, the grounds on which the order 
for his detention has been made, and 
 
(ii) afford him the earliest opportunity of making the representation against 
the order. 
It may, however, be noted that while the grounds for making the order are to be 
supplied, the authority making such order is not bound to disclose those facts which it 
considers to be against the public interest.

This group of fundamental rights consists of Articles 23 and 24. They provide for 
rights against exploitation of all citizens and non-citizens. Taking them one by one

EP-GCL-1 
29
they guarantee certain rights by imposing certain prohibitions not only against the 
State but also against private persons. 
(a)  Prohibition of traffic in human beings and forced labour 
Article 23 imposes a complete ban on traffic in human beings, federal and other 
similar  forms  of  forced  labour.  The  contravention  of  these  provisions is declared 
punishable by law. Thus the traditional system of beggary particularly in villages, 
becomes unconstitutional and a person who is asked to do any labour without 
payment or even a labourer with payment against his desire can complain against the 
violation of his fundamental right under Article 23. 
‗Traffic‘ in human beings means to deal in men and women like goods, such as to 
sell or let or otherwise dispose them of. ‗Begar‘ means involuntary work without 
payment. 
The State can impose compulsory service for public purposes such as 
conscription for defence for social service etc. While imposing such compulsory 
service the State cannot make any discrimination on grounds only of religion, race, 
caste or class or any of them. (Clause 2 of Article 23). 
(b)  Prohibition of employment of children 
Article 24 prohibits the employment of children below the age of fourteen in any 
factory or mine. The Employment of Children Act, 1938; The Factories Act, 1948; The 
Mines Act, 1952; The Apprentices‘ Act, 1961; and the Child Labour (Prohibition and 
Regulation) Act, 1986 are some of the important enactments in the statute book to 
protect the children from exploitation by unscrupulous employers. 
The Supreme Court has issued detailed guidelines as to child labour in M.C. 
Mehta v. State of T.N., AIR 1993 S.C. 699. 
9.  Right to Freedom of Religion 
With Article 25 begins a group of provisions ensuring equality of all religions 
thereby promoting secularism. 
Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of 
religion. 
Article 25 gives to every person the: 
 
(i) freedom of conscience, and 
 (ii) the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion. 
But this freedom is subject to restrictions imposed by the State on the following 
grounds: 
 
(i) public order, morality and health, 
 (ii) other provisions in Part III of the Constitution, 
 (iii) any law regulating or restricting any economic, financial political or other 
secular activity which may be associated with religious practice, and 
 (iv) any law providing for social welfare and reform or the throwing open of Hindu 
religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of 
Hindus. 
The Supreme Court in State of Karnataka v. Dr. Praveen Bhai Thogadia, (2004) 
9 SCC 684, held that secularism means that State should have no religion of its own 
EP-GCL-1 
30
and each person, whatever his religion, must get an assurance from the State that he 
has the protection of law to freely profess, practise and propagate his religion and 
freedom of conscience. 
The freedom of religion conferred by the present Article is not confined to the 
citizens of India but extends to all persons including aliens and individuals exercising 
their rights individually or through institutions (Ratilal v. State of Bombay, (1954) SCR 
105, Stanslaus v. State, AIR 1975 M. 163). 
The term ‗Hindu‘ here includes person professing the Sikh, Jain, or Buddhist 
religion also and accordingly the term ‗Hindu religious institutions‘ also includes the 
institutions belonging to these religions. Special right has been accorded to the Sikhs 
to wear kirpan as part of professing their religion. 
(a) The Concept of Religion 
Our Constitution does not define the word religion. Religion is certainly a matter 
of faith with individuals or communities and it is not necessarily theistic — There are 
well-known religions in India like Buddhism and Jainism which do not believe in God 
or in any Intelligent First Cause. A religion undoubtedly has its basis in any system of 
beliefs or doctrines which are regarded by those who profess that religion as 
conducive to their spiritual well being, but it would not be correct to say that religion is 
nothing else but a doctrine or belief. A religion may not only lay down a code of 
ethical rules for its follower to accept, it might prescribe rituals and observances, 
ceremonies and modes or worship which are regarded as integral parts of religion 
and those forms and observances might extend even to matters of food and dress 
(Justice Mukherjee in Commr. of H.R.E., Madras v. Sirur Mutt, A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 282). 
(b)  Freedom to manage religious affairs 
Although no clear cut distinction is possible, yet it may be said that while Article 
25 discussed above protects the religious freedom of individuals. Article 26, deals 
with the collective rights of religious denominations. Here the question may be raised 
as to what is a religious denomination? In the words of our Supreme Court: 
“The word ‘denomination’ has been defined in the Oxford Dictionary to mean a 
collection of individuals classed together under the 
same name: a religious sect or body having a common 
faith and organisation and designated by a distinctive 
name. It is well known that the practice of setting up 
Maths as centres of theological teaching was started by 
Shri Sankaracharya and was followed by various 
teachers since then. After Sankaracharya, came a galaxy 
of religious teachers and philosophers who founded the different sects and 
sub-sects of the Hindu religion that we find in India at the present day. Each 
one of such sects or sub-sects can certainly be called a religious 
denomination, as it is designated by a distinctive name, in many cases it is the 
name of the founder and has a common faith and common spiritual 
organization. The followers of Ramanuja, who are known by the name of Shri 
Vaishnavas, undoubtedly constitute a religious denomination, and so do the 
followers of Madhavacharya and other religious teachers" (Mukherjee J. in 
Commr. of H.R.E., Madras v. Sirur Mutt., A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 282). 
 
EP-GCL-1 
31
However, a religious denomination is not a ‗citizen‘. Now coming to the provisions 
of Article 26, it grants to every religious denomination or any sect thereof the right— 
 
(i) to establish and maintain institutions of religious and charitable purposes; 
 (ii) to manage its own affairs in matters of religion; 
 (iii) to own and acquire movable and immovable property; and 
 (iv) to administer such property in accordance with law. 
All these rights are subject to public order, morality and health, and, therefore, if 
they conflict then the right will give way to these exceptions. One more exception may 
be noted. A denomination‘s right to manage its own affairs in matters of religion is 
subject to the State‘s power to throw open Hindu religious institutions of a public 
nature to all classes or sections of Hindus covered in Article 25. 
(c)  Freedom as to payment of tax for the promotion of any particular religion 
According to Article 27, no person can be compelled to pay any taxes, the 
proceeds of which are specially appropriated in payment of expenses for the 
promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination. It is 
notable that freedom not to pay taxes is only with respect to those taxes the proceeds 
of which are specially appropriated in payment of expenses for the promotion or 
maintenance of any particular religion or denomination. 
(d) Freedom as to attendance at religious instruction or religious worship in 
educational institutions 
Article 28 prohibits religious instruction in certain educational institutions and 
gives freedom to a person to participate in such religious instructions. The Article 
states that— 
 
(i) No religious instruction can be provided in any educational instituion wholly 
maintained out of State funds. However, this prohibiton does not extend to an 
educational institution which is administered by the State but has been 
established under any endowment or trust which requires that religious 
instruction shall be imparted in such institution. 
 (ii) No person attending an educational institution recognised by the State or 
receiving aid out of State funds cannot be required: 
 
(a) to take part in any religious instruction that may be imparted in such 
institution; or 
 
(b) to attend any religious worship that may be conducted in such institution 
or any premises attached thereto, 
unless such person or if such person is a minor, his guardian has given his consent 
thereto. It may, however, be noted that although person can be compelled to take 
religious instructions or attend worship, without his consent, yet at the same time 
such person is not entitled to perform any religious ceremony or worship which is 
contrary to the tenets of that educational institution (Sanjib v. St. Paul’s College, 61 
C.W.N. 71).

10.  Cultural and Educational Rights [Rights of Minorities] 
Minority 
The word ‗minority‘ has not been defined in the Constitution. The Supreme Court 
in D.A.V. College, Jullundur v. State of Punjab, A.I.R. 1971, S.C. 1737, seems to 
have stated the law on the point. It said that minority should be determined in relation 
to a particular impugned legislation. The determination of minority should be based 
on the area of operation of a particular piece of legislation. If it is a State law, the 
population of the State should be kept in mind and if it is a Central Law the population 
of the whole of India should be taken into account. 
The two Articles guarantee the following rights: 
(a)  Protection of interests of Minorities 
Article 29 guarantees two rights: 
 
(i) Any section of the citizens residing in the territory of India or any part thereof 
having a distinct language, script or culture of its own has the right to 
conserve the same. Thus, citizens from Tamil Nadu or Bengal has the right to 
conserve their language or culture if they are living in Delhi, a Hindi speaking 
area and vice versa.  
 (ii) No citizen can be denied admission into any educational institution 
maintained by the State or receiving aid out of State funds on grounds only of 
religion, race, caste, language, or any of them. This provision is general and 
applies to each citizen individually and is not confined to a group of citizens. 
An exception is made to this right to the effect that if a special provision is 
made for the admission of persons belonging to educationally or/and socially 
backward classes or scheduled castes or scheduled tribes it shall be valid. 
(b)  Right of Minorities to establish and administer educational institutions 
The rights guaranteed to the minorities in Article 30 are even more important than 
those covered by Article 29. Following rights are declared in Article 30 : 
 
(i) All minorities, whether based on religion or on language, shall have the right 
to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. It may be 
noted here that this right is not limited only to linguistic minorities but it 
extends to religious minorities also. Both of them have been given the 
freedom to establish and administer educational institutions of their own 
choice. So they can establish educational institution of any type and cannot 
be restrained from its administration. The maladministration may be checked 
by the State but administration cannot be entrusted to outside hands. Mal-
administration defeats the very object of Article 30, which is to promote 
 
EP-GCL-1 
33
excellence of minority institutions in the field of education (All Saints High 
School v. Government of A.P., AIR 1980 SC 1042). And in that educational 
institution they may teach religion, or may give secular education, but no bar 
can be imposed on their choice. In the matter of medium of instruction also, 
the minorities are completely free to adopt any medium of their choice. 
 (ii) The State cannot, in granting aid to educational institutions, discriminate 
against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the 
management of a minority, whether based on religion or language. It has 
been held that the State cannot impose conditions in granting aid to such 
institutions. Further, the minority institutions are also entitled to recognition 
and the State cannot deny them that right, merely because they do not follow 
the directions of the State which impair rights under Article 30 (In re. Kerala 
Education Bill 1957, A.I.R. 1958 S.C. 956; Sidhrajbhai v. State of Gujarat, 
A.I.R. 1963 S.C. 540). 
In DAV College v. State of Punjab, AIR 1971 SC 1737, it was held that any 
community—religious or linguistic, which is numerically less than 50 percent 
of the population of that State, is a minority within the meaning of Article 30. 
The expression minority in Article 30(1) is used as distinct from „Any sections 
of citizens‟ in Article 29(1) which lends support to the view that Article 30(1) 
deals with national minorities or minorities recognised in the context of the 
entire nation (St. Xaviers College v. State of Gujarat, AIR 1974 SC 1389). 
The right conferred on religious and linguistic minorities to adminster educational 
institutions of their choice, though couched in absolute terms, is not free from 
regulation. Delhi High Court in Delhi Abibhavak Mahasangh v. U.O.I. and others AIR 
1999 Delhi 124 held that Article 30(1) of the Constitution does not permit, minorities 
to indulge in commercialisation of education in the garb of constitutional protection. 
For the application of this right minority institutions are divided into three classes: (i) 
institution which neither seek aid nor recognition from the State; (ii) institution that 
seek aid from the State; and (iii) institutions which seek recognition but not aid. While 
the institutions of class (i) cannot be subjected to any regulations except those 
emanating from the general law of the land such as labour, contract or tax laws, the 
institutions in classes (ii) and (iii) can be subjected to regulations pertaining to the 
academic standards and to the better administration of the institution, in the interest 
of that institution itself. 
In T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka (2002) 8 SCC 481, is an eleven 
Bench decision dealing with right of minorities to establish and administer 
educational institutions and correctness of the decision in St. Stephen’s 
College case. While interpreting Article 30, the Supreme 
Court held that minority includes both linguistic and 
religious minorities and for determination of minority status, 
the unit would be the State and not whole of India. Further, 
the right of minorities to establish and administer 
educational institutions (including professional education) 
was not absolute and regulatory measures could be 
imposed for ensuring educational standards and maintaining excellence 
thereof. Right of minorities included right to determine the procedure and 
method of admission and selection of students, which should be fair and 
transparent and based on merit. 
EP-GCL-1 
34
The Constitution (44th Amendment Act) has introduced new sub-clause (1A) 
which provides that wherever compulsory acquisition of any property of an 
educational institution established and administered by a minority is provided under 
any law, the State shall ensure that the amout fixed by or determined under any such 
law is such as would not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed under this Article. 
11.  Articles 31A, 31B and 31C relating to Property 
Right to property is no more a fundamental right which was previously 
guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution by Article 31. 
But the right to property has been inserted by Article 300A under Part XII of the 
Constitution. Article 300A reads — ―No person shall be deprived of his property save 
by authority of law‖. 
Saving of Laws Providing for Acquisition of Estates etc. 
Then follows Article 31A which is an exception to the right of equality as 
guaranteed in Article 14 and to the six freedoms as guaranteed in Article 19, if they 
come into conflict with any law mentioned in Article 31A. 
Such laws are those which provide for— 
 
(i) the acquisition by the State of any estate or any rights therein or the 
extinguishment or modification of any such rights. ‗Estate‘ here means the 
property included within that expression according to the land tenurers 
applicable in the area where it is situated. And ‗rights‘ in relation to an estate 
means proprietory and other intermediary rights. In short, such laws are 
those which related to agrarian reforms, or 
 (ii) the taking over of the management of any property by the State for a limited 
period in the public interest or in order to secure the proper management of 
the property, or 
 (iii) the amalgamation of two or more corporations either in the public interest or 
in order to secure the proper management of any of the corporations, or 
 (iv) the extinguishment or modification of any rights of managing agents, 
secretaries and treasurers, managing directors or managers of corporations, 
or of any voting rights of shareholders thereof, or 
 (v) the extinguishment or modification of any rights accruing by virtue of any 
agreement, lease or licence for the purpose of searching for, or winning any 
mineral or mineral oil or the premature termination or cancellation of any 
such agreement, lease or licence. 
However, limitations, have been imposed with respect to the laws relating to the 
acquisition of the estates. They are: 
 (a) If such a law is made by a State Legislature then it cannot be protected by 
the provisions of Article 31A unless such law having been reserved for the 
consideration of the President has received his assent, and 
 (b) If the law provides for the acquisition of (i) any land within the ceiling limit 
applicable in that area, (ii) any building or structure standing thereon or 
apartment thereto, it (law) shall not be valid unless it provides for payment of 
compensation at a rate which shall not be less than the market value thereof. 
 
EP-GCL-1 
35
This provision, however, has been amended by the Constitution (29th 
Amendment) Act. 
Validation of certain Acts and Regulations 
Article 31B certain laws against attack on the ground of violation of any 
fundamental rights. The laws so protected are specified in the Nineth Schedule to the 
Constitution. These laws also relate mainly to land reforms. 
Saving of Laws giving effect to certain Directive Principles 
Article 31C added by 25th Amendment of the Constitution lifted to the 
constitutional limitations on the powers of State, imposed by Article 14 (equality 
before law) and Article 19 (freedoms) as regards law giving effect to the policy of the 
State towards securing the principles — specified in clause (b) or clause (c) of Article 
39. These principles are— 
 
(i) that the ownership and control of the matenal resources of the community 
are so distributed as best to subserve the common good, and 
 (ii) that the operation of the economic system does not result in the 
concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment. 
The issue whether the 24th, 25th and 29th Amendments made by Parliament 
were valid or not was raised in the Supreme Court. In [Kesavananda Bharti v. State 
of Kerala, (1973) S.C.C. 225], the majority judgement (of a full bench of 13 judges) 
upheld the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution provided it did not alter its 
basic framework. 
By the 42nd Amendment in Article 31-C for the words the principles specified in 
clause (a) or clause (c) of Article 34 the words in all or any of the principles laid down 
in Part IV were substituted. But this substitution was held to be void by the Supreme 
Court in Minerva Mills v. Union of India, (1980) 2 SCC 591. 
12.  Right to Constitutional Remedies 
Article 32 guarantees the enforcement of Fundamental Rights. It is remedial and 
not substantive in nature. The rest of the Articles 33 to 35 relate to supplementary 
matters and do not create or guarantee any right. Therefore, we shall discuss Art. 32 
first and then rest of the Articles i.e. 33-35 briefly. 
Remedies for enforcement of Fundamental Rights 
It is a cardinal principle of jurisprudence that where there is a right there is a 
remedy (ubi jus ibi remedium) and if rights are given without there being a remedy for 
their enforcement, they are of no use. While remedies are available in the 
Constitution and under the ordinary laws, Article 32 makes it a fundamental right that 
a person whose fundamental right is violated has the right to move the Supreme 
Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of this fundamental right. It is 
really a far reaching provision in the sense that a person need not first exhaust the 
other remedies and then go to the Supreme Court. On the other hand, he can directly 
raise the matter before highest Court of the land and the Supreme Court is 
empowered to issue directions or orders or writs in the nature of habeas corpus, 
mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari, whichever may be appropriate 
for the enforcement of the right, the violation of which has been alleged. This power 
of the Supreme Court to issue directions, etc., may also be assigned to other Courts 
by Parliament without affecting the powers of the Supreme Court. 
EP-GCL-1 
36
The right to move the Supreme Court is itself a guarantee right and the 
significance of this has been assessed by Gajendragadkar, J. in the following 
words: 
“The fundamental right to move this Court can therefore be 
appropriately described as the cornerstone of the democratic 
edifice raised by the Constitution. That is why it is natural that 
this Court should, in the words of Patanjali Sastri, J., regard itself 
„as the protector and guarantor of fundamental rights‟, and 
should 
declare 
that 
“it 
cannot, 
consistently 
with 
the 
responsibility laid upon it, refuse to entertain applications seeking protection 
against infringements of such rights. In discharging the duties assigned to it, 
this Court has to play the role of „sentinel on the qui vive’ (State of Madras v. 
V.G. Row, AIR 1952 SC 196) and it must always regard it as its solemn duty to 
protect the said fundamental rights „zealously and vigilantly‟ Daryao v. State of 
U.P., AIR 1961 SC 1457). 
Where a fundamental right is also available against the private persons such  as 
the right under Articles 17, 23 and 24, the Supreme Court can always be approached 
for appropriate remedy against the violation of such rights by private individuals. 
(Peoples’ Union for Democratic Rights v. Union of India, AIR 1982 SC 1473). A 
petitioners challenge under Article 32 extends not only to the validity of a law but also 
to an executive order issued under the authority of the law. 
The right guaranteed by Article 32 shall not be suspended except as provided in 
the Constitution. Constitution does not contemplate such suspension except by way 
of President‘s order under Article 359 when a proclamation of Emergency is in force. 
Again in Article 31C the words appearing at the end of the main paragraph, 
namely and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy 
shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to 
such policy were declared to be void in Kesavananda's case. 
Supplementary provisions 
Articles 33-35 — contain certain supplementary provisions. 
Article 33 authorises Parliament to restrict or abrogate the application of 
fundamental rights in relation to members of armed forces, para-military forces, police 
forces and analogous forces. 
Article 34 is primarily concerned with granting indemnity by law in respect of acts 
done during operation of martial law. The Constitution does not have a provision 
authorizing proclamation of martial law. Article 34 says that Parliament may by law 
indemnify any person in the service of the Union or of State or any other person, for 
an act done during martial law. 
Article 35 provide that wherever parliament has by an express provision been 
empowered to make a law restricting a fundamental right Parliament alone can do so, 
(and not the state legislature). 
13. Amendability of the Fundamental Rights 
 (A) Since 1951, questions have been raised about the scope of amending 
process contained in Article 368 of the Constitution. The basic question 
 
EP-GCL-1 
37
raised was whether the Fundamental Rights are amendable. The question 
whether the word ‗Law‘ in Clause (2) of Article 13 includes amendments or 
not or whether amendment in Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Part III of 
the Constitution is permissible under the procedure laid down in Article 368 
had come before the Supreme Court in Shankari Prasad v. Union of India, 
A.I.R. 1951 S.C. 458, in 1951 where the First Amendment was challenged. 
The Court held that the power to amend the Constitution including the 
Fundamental Rights, was contained in Article 368 and that the word ‗Law‘ in 
Article 13(2) did not include an amendment to the Constitution which was 
made in exercise of constituent and not legislative power. This decision was 
approved by the majority judgement in Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan, 
A.I.R. 1965 S.C. 845. 
 
 Thus, until the case of I.C. Golak Nath v. State of Punjab, A.I.R. 1967, 
S.C. 1643, the Supreme Court had been holding that no part of our 
Constitution was unamenable and that parliament might, by passing a 
Constitution Amendment Act, in compliance with the requirements of 
Article 368, amend any provision of the Constitution, including the 
Fundamental Rights and Article 368 itself. 
 (B) But, in Golak Nath’s case, a majority overruled the previous decisions 
and held that the Fundamental Rights are outside the amendatory 
process if the amendment takes away or abridges any of the rights. The 
majority, in Golak Nath’s case, rested its conclusion on the view that 
the power to amend the Constitution was also a legislative power 
conferred by Article 245 by the Constitution, so that a Constitution 
Amendment Act was also a „law‟ within the purview of Article 13(2). 
 (C) To nullify the effect of Golak Nath’s case, Parliament passed the Constitution 
(Twenty-Fourth Amendment) Act in 1971 introducing certain changes in Article 
13 and Article 368, so as to assert the power of Parliament (denied to it in 
Golak Nath’s case) to amend the Fundamental Rights. The Constitutional 
validity of the 24th Amendment was challenged in the case of 
Kesavanand Bharti v. State of Kerala, A.I.R. 1973 S.C. 1461. The Supreme 
Court upheld the validity of 24th Constitutional Amendment holding that 
Parliament can amend any Part of the Constitution including the 
Fundamental Rights. But the Court made it clear that Parliament cannot 
alter the basic structure or framework of the Constitution. In Indira Gandhi 
v. Raj Narain, AIR 1975 S.C. 2299, the appellant challenged the decision of the 
Allahabad High Court who declared her election as invalid on ground of corrupt 
practices. In the mean time Parliament enacted the 39th Amendment 
withdrawing the control of the S.C. over election disputes involving among 
others, the Prime Minister. The S.C. upheld the challenge of 39th amendment 
and held that democracy was an essential feature forming part of the basic 
structure of the Constitution. The exclusion of Judicial review in Election 
disputes in this manner damaged the basic structure. The doctrine of ‘basic 
structure’ placed a limitation on the powers of the Parliament to introduce 
substantial alterations or to make a new Constitution. 
To neutralise the effect of this limitation, the Constitution (Forty-Second 
Amendment) Act, 1976 added to Article 368 two new clauses. By new clause (4), it 
has been provided that no amendment of the Constitution made before or after the 
EP-GCL-1 
38
Forty-Second Amendment Act shall be questioned in any Court on any ground. New 
clause (5) declares that there shall be no limitation whatever on the Constitutional 
power of parliament to amend by way of addition, variation or repeal the provisions of 
this Constitution made under Article 368. 
The scope and extent of the application of the doctrine of basic structure 
again came up for discussion before the S.C. in Minerva Mill Ltd. v. Union of 
India, (1980) 3 SCC, 625. The Supreme Court unanimously held clauses (4) and 
(5) of Article 368 and Section 55 of the 42nd Amendment Act as 
unconstitutional transgressing the limits of the amending power and damaging 
or destroying the basic structure of the Constitution. 
In Woman Rao v. Union of India, (1981) 2 SCC 362 the Supreme Court held that 
the  amendments to the Constitution  made on or after 24.4.1973 by which Ninth 
Schedule was amended from time to time by inclusion of various Acts, regulations 
therein  were open to challenge on the ground that they , or any one or more of them 
are beyond the constitutional power of  Parliament since they damage the basic or 
essential features of the Constitution or its basic structure. [See also Bhim Singh Ji v. 
Union of India (1981)1 SCC 166.]  
In L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India (1997) 3 SCC 261 the Supreme Court held 
that power of judicial review is an integral and essential feature of the Constitution 
constituting  the basic part , the jurisdiction so conferred on the High Courts and the 
Supreme Court is a part of in- violable basic structure of the Constitution.  
In I.R. Coelho v. State of T.N., (2007) 2 SCC 1, Article 31-B as introduced by the 
Constitution (First amendment) Act 1951 was held to be valid by the Supreme Court. 
The fundamental question before the   nine Judge Constitution Bench was whether 
on or after 24.4.1973 (i.e. when the basic structure of the Constitution was 
propounded) it is permissible for the Parliament under Article 31-B to immunize 
legislations from fundamental rights by inserting them into the Ninth Schedule and if 
so what is the effect on the power of judicial review of the court. The challenge was 
made to the validity of the urban land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 which was 
inserted in the Ninth Schedule.  
The Supreme Court held that all amendments to the Constitution made on or 
after 24.4.1973 by which Ninth Schedule is amended by inclusion of various laws 
therein shall have to be tested on the touch stone of the basic or essential features of 
the Constitution as reflected in Article 21 read with Article 14, Article 19 and the 
principles under lying them. So also any law included in Schedule IX do not become 
part of the Constitution. They derive their validity on account of being included in 
Schedule IX and this exercise is to be tested every time it is undertaken. If the validity 
of any Ninth Schedule law has already been upheld by this Court, it would not be 
open to challenge such law on the principles declared in this judgement. However, if 
a law held to be violative of any rights of Part III is subsequently incorporated in the 
Ninth Schedule after 24.4.1973 such a violation shall be open to challenge on the 
ground that it destroys or damages the basic structure  doctrine.   
In Glanrock  Estate (P) Ltd. v. State of Tamil Nadu (2010) 10 SCC 96, the 
Supreme Court upheld constitutional validity of Constitution (Thirty-fourth) 
Amendment Act, 1974.  By Constitution (Thirty-fourth) Amendment Act, 1974 Gudalur 
Janman Estates (Abolition & Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1969 was inserted in the 
Ninth Schedule as item 80.  
 
EP-GCL-1 
39
It was alleged that the 1969 Act violated the principle of equality because by the 
T N Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961 only ceiling surplus forest 
lands vested in the State but by the 1969 Act all forests vested in the State.  The 
constitutional amendment was further challenged on the ground that it validated the 
1969 Act by inserting it in the Ninth Schedule in spite of Section 3 of the 1969 Act 
having been declared as unconstitutional in Balmadies case, (1972) 2 SCC 133, 
thereby violating the principles of judicial review, rule of law and separation of 
powers. (Section 3 had been declared unconstitutional in Balmadies case because it 
could not be shown how vesting of forest lands was an agrarian reform.)   
Upholding the constitutional validity of the amendment, the Supreme Court held:  
None of the facets of Article 14 have been abrogated by the Constitution (Thirty-
fourth Amendment) Act, 1974, which included the 1969 Act in the Ninth Schedule.  
When the 1969 Act was put in the Ninth Schedule in1 974, the Act received immunity 
from Article 31(2) with retrospective effect.  
It is only that breach of the principle of equality which is of the character of 
destroying the basic framework of the Constitution which will not be protected by 
Article 31-B.  If every breach of Articl3 14, however egregious, is held to be 
unprotected by Article 31-B, there would be no purpose in protection by Article 31-B. 
In the present case, not even an ordinary principle of equality under Article 14, 
leave aside the egalitarian equality as an overarching principle, is violated.  Even 
assuming for the same of argument that Article 14 stood violated, even then the 1969 
Act in any event stood validated by its insertion in the Ninth Schedule vide the 
Constitution (Thirty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1974.There is no merit in the submission 
that the Constitution (Thirty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1974 by which the 1969 Act was 
inserted in the Ninth Schedule as item 80 seeks to confer naked power on Parliament 
and destroys basic features of the Constitution, namely, judicial review and 
separation of powers as well as rule of law. 
The doctrine of basic structure provides a touchstone on which validity of the 
constitutional amendment Act could be judged. Core constitutional values/ 
overarching principles like secularism; egalitarian equality etc. fall out side the 
amendatory power under Article 368 of the Constitution and Parliament cannot 
amend the constitution to abrogate these principles so as to rewrite the constitution.  
[In Glanrock  Estate (P) Ltd. v. State of T N (2010) 10 SCC 96.] 
III.  DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY 
The Sub-committee on Fundamental Rights constituted by the Constituent 
Assembly has suggested two types of Fundamental Rights — one which can be 
enforced in the Courts of law and the other which because of their different nature 
cannot be enforced in the law Courts. Later on however, the former were put under 
the head ‗Fundamental Rights‘ as Part III which we have already discussed and the 
latter were put separately in Part IV of the Constitution under the heading ‗Directive 
Principles of State Policy‘ which are discussed in the following pages. 
The Articles included in Part IV of the Constitution (Articles 36 to 51) contain 
certain Directives which are the guidelines for the future Government to lead the 
country. Article 37 provides that the ‗provisions contained in this part (i) shall not be 
enforceable by any Court, but the principles therein laid down are neverthless (ii) 
fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the state to 
EP-GCL-1 
40
apply these principles in making laws. The Directives, however, differ from the 
fundamental rights contained in Part-III of the Constitution or the ordinary laws of the 
land in the following respects : 
 
(i) The Directives are not enforceable in the courts and do not create any 
justiciable rights in favour of individuals. 
 (ii) The Directives require to be implemented by legislation and so long as there 
is no law carrying out the policy laid down in a Directive neither the state nor 
an individual can violate any existing law. 
 (iii) The Directives per-se do not confer upon or take away any legislative power 
from the appropriate legislature. 
 (iv) The courts cannot declare any law as void on the ground that it contravenes 
any of the Directive Principles. 
 (v) The courts are not competent to compel the Government to carry out any 
Directives or to make any law for that purpose. 
 (vi) Though it is the duty of the state to implement the Directives, it can do so 
only subject to the limitations imposed by the different provisions of the 
Constitution upon the exercise of the legislative and executive power by the 
state. 
Conflict between a Fundamental Right and a Directive Principle 
The declarations made in Part IV of the Constitution under the head ‗Directive 
Principles of State Policy‘ are in many cases of a wider import than the declarations 
made in Part III as ‗Fundamental Rights‘. Hence, the question of priority in case of 
conflict between the two classes of the provisions may easily arise. What will be the 
legal position if a law enacted to enforce a Directive Principle violates a Fundamental 
Right? Initialy, the Courts, adopted a strict view in this respect and ruled that a 
Directive Principle could not override a Fundamental Right, and in case of conflict 
between the two, a Fundamental Right would prevail over the Directive Principle. 
When the matter came before the Supreme Court in State of Madras v. 
Champakram Dorairajan, AIR 1951 S.C. 226, where the validity of a Government 
order alleged to be made to give effect to a Directive Principle was challenged 
as being violative of a Fundamental Right, the Supreme Court made the 
observation that : 
“The Directive Principles of State Policy have to conform to and run as 
subsidiary to the chapter of Fundamental Rights.” 
The Court ruled that while the Fundamental Rights were enforceable, the 
Directive Principles were not, and so the laws made to implement Directive 
Principles could not take away Fundamental Rights. 
The Supreme Court also pointed out that looking at Directive Principles, we 
find as was envisaged by the Constitution makers, that they lay down the 
ideals to be observed by every Government to bring about an economic 
democracy in this country. Such a democracy actually is our need and unless 
we achieve it as soon as possible, there is a danger to our political and 
constitutional democracy of being overthrown by undemocratic and 
unconstitutional means. 
 
EP-GCL-1

Important Directive Principles: To be specific, the important Directive 
Principles are enumerated below: 
 
(a) State to secure a social order for the promotion of welfare of the 
people:

EP-GCL-1 
42
 (ff) The State take steps, by suitable legislation or in any other way, to secure 
the participation of workers in the management of undertakings, 
establishments or other organisations engaged in any industry (Article 43A).

particular it must endeavour to bring about prohibition of the consumption, 
except for medicinal purposes, in intoxicating drinks and of drugs which are 
injurious to health (Article 47).

 (n) In international matters the State must endeavour to promote peace and 
security, maintain just and honourable relations in respect of international law 
between nations, treaty obligations and encourage settlement of international 
disputes by arbitration (Article 51). 
IV.  FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES 
Article 51A imposing the fundamental duties on every citizen of India 
was inserted by the Constitution Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976. 
The objective in introducing these duties is not laid down in the Bill 
except that since the duties of the citizens are not specified in the 
Constitution, so it was thought necessary to introduce them. 
These Fundamental Duties are: 
 (a) to abide by the constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the 
National Flag and the National Anthem; 
 (b) To cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for 
freedom; 
 (c) to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India; 
 (d) to defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so; 
 
EP-GCL-1 
43
? 
 (e) to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the 
people of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional 
diversities; to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women; 
 
(f) to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture; 
 (g) to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers 
and wild life, and to have compassion for living creatures; 
 (h) to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and 
reform; 
 
(i) to safeguard public property and to abjure violence; 
 
(j) to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity 
so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and 
achievement. 
 (k) To provide opportunities for education to one‘s child or, as the case may be, 
ward between the age of six and fourteen years. 
Since the duties are imposed upon the citizens and not upon the States, 
legislation is necessary for their implementation. Fundamental duties can‘t be 
enforced by writs (Surya Narain v. Union of India, AIR 1982 Raj 1). The Supreme 
Court in AIIMS Students’ Union v. AIIMS (2002) SCC 428 has reiterated that though 
the fundamental duties are not enforceable by the courts, they provide a valuable 
guide and aid to the interpretation of Constitutional and legal issues. 
Further, in Om Prakash v. State of U.P. (2004) 3 SCC 402, the Supreme Court 
held that fundamental duties enjoined on citizens under Article 51-A should also 
guide the legislative and executive actions of elected or non-elected institutions and 
organizations of citizens including municipal bodies.

Correct answer: False 
V.  ORDINANCE MAKING POWERS 
1.  Of the President 
In its Article 53 the Constitution lays down that the ―executive power of the union 
shall be vested in the president‖. The President of India shall, thus, be the head of the 
‗executive power‘ of the union. The executive power may be defined as the power of 
―carrying on the business of Government‖ or ―the administration of the affairs of the 
state‖ excepting functions which are vested in any other authority by the Constitution. 
The various powers that are included within the comprehensive expression ‗executive 
EP-GCL-1 
44
power‘ in a modern state have been classified under various heads as follows: 
 
(i) Administrative power, i.e., the execution of the laws and the administration of 
the departments of Government. 
 (ii) Military power, i.e., the command of the armed forces and the conduct of war. 
 (iii) Legislative power, i.e., the summoning prorogation, etc. of the legislature. 
 (iv) Judicial power, i.e., granting of pardons, reprieves etc. to persons convicted 
of crime. 
These powers vest in the President under each of these heads, subject to the 
limitations made under the Constitution. 
Ordinance-making power 
The most important legislative power conferred on the President is to promulgate 
Ordinances. Article 123 of the Constitution provides that the President shall have the 
power to legislate by Ordinances at any time when it is not possible to have a 
parliamentary enactment on the subject, immediately. This is a special feature of the 
Constitution of India. 
The ambit of this Ordinance-making power of the President is co-extensive with 
the legislative powers of Parliament, that is to say it may relate to any subject in 
respect of which parliament has the right to legislate and is subject to the same 
constitutional limitations as legislation by Parliament. 
On the other hand, according to Article 13(3)(a) ―Law‖ includes an ―Ordinance‖. 
But an Ordinance shall be of temporary duration. It may be of any nature, i.e., it may 
be retrospective or may amend or repeal any law or Act of Parliament itself. 
This independent power of the executive to legislate by Ordinance has the 
following peculiarities: 
 
(i) the Ordinance-making power will be available to the President only when 
both the Houses of Parliament have been prorogued or is otherwise not in 
session, so that it is not possible to have a law enacted by Parliament. 
However, Ordinance can be made even if only one House is in Session 
because law cannot be made by that House in session alone. Both the 
Houses must be in session when Parliament makes the law. The President‘s 
Ordinance making power under the Constitution is not a co-ordinate or 
parallel power of legislation along with Legislature. 
 (ii) this power is to be exercised by the President on the advice of his Council of 
Ministers. 
 (iii) the President must be satisfied about the need for the Ordinance and he 
cannot be compelled 
 (iv) the Ordinance must be laid before Parliament when it re-assembles, and 
shall automatically cease to have effect at the expiration of 6 weeks from the 
date of re-assembly or before resolutions have been passed disapproving the 
Ordinance. 
 (v) the period of six weeks will be counted from the latter date if the Houses 
reassemble on different dates.

Judicial review of the President‘s satisfaction is not totally ruled out. 
 
(i) A.K. Roy v. Union of India, AIR 1982 SC 710. 
 (ii) Cooper v. Union of India, AIR 1970 SC 564. 
2.  Of the Governor 
The executive power of the State is vested in the Governor and all executive 
action of the State has to be taken in the name of the Governor. Normally there shall 
be a Governor for each State but the same person can be appointed as Governor for 
two or more states. The Governor of a State is not elected but is appointed by the 
President and holds his office at the pleasure of the President. The head of the 
executive power to a State is the Governor just as the President for the Union. 
Powers: The Governor possesses executive, legislation and judicial powers as 
the Presidents except that he has no diplomate or military powers like the President. 
Ordinance making power 
This power is exercised under the head of ‗legislative powers‘. The Governor‘s 
power to make Ordinances as given under Article 213 is similar to the Ordinance 
making power of the President and have the force of an Act of the State Legislature. 
He can make Ordinance only when the state Legislature or either of the two Houses 
(where it is bicameral) is not in session. He must be satisfied that circumstances exist 
which render it necessary to take immediate action. While exercising this power 
Governor must act with the aid and advise of the Council of Ministers. But in following 
cases the Governor cannot promulgate any Ordinance without instructions from the 
President: 
 (a) if a Bill containing the same provisions would under this constitution  have 
required the previous section of the President. 
 (b) he would have deemed it necessary to reserve  a Bill containing the same 
provisions for the consideration of the President. 
 (c) an Act of the state legislature containing the same provisions would under 
this constitution have been invalid under having been reserved for the 
consideration of the President, it had received the assent of the President. 
The Ordinance must be laid before the state legislature (when it re-assembles) 
and shall automatically cease to have effect at the expiration of six weeks from the 
date of the re-assembly unless disapproved earlier by that legislature.

VI.  LEGISLATIVE POWERS OF THE UNION AND THE STATES 
1.  Two Sets of Government 
The Indian Constitution is essentially federal. 
Dicey, in the ―Law of Constitution‘ has said ―Federation means the distribution of 
the force of the state among a number of co-ordinate bodies, each originating in and 
controlled by the Constitution‖. The field of Government is divided between the 
Federal and State Governments which are not subordinate to one another but are co-
ordinate and independent within the sphere allotted to them. The existence of co-
ordinate authorities independent of each other is the gist of the federal principle. 
A federal constitution establishes a dual polity as it comprises two levels of 
Government. At one level, there exists a Central Government having jurisdiction over 
the whole country and reaching down to the person and property of every individual 
therein. At the other level, there exists the State Government each of which exercises 
jurisdiction in one of the States into which the country is divided under the 
Constitution. A citizen of the federal country thus becomes subject to the  decrees of 
two Government — the central and the regional. 
The Union of India is now composed of 28 States and both the Union and the 
States derive their authority from the Constitution which divides all powers-legislative, 
executive and financial, between them. The result is that the States are not delegates 
of the Union and though there are agencies and devices for Union control over the 
States in many matters, the States are autonomous within their own spheres as 
allotted to them by the Constitution. Both the Union and States are equally subject to 
the limitations imposed by the Constitution, say, for example, the exercise of 
legislative powers being limited by Fundamental Rights. However, there are some 
parts of Indian territory which are not covered by these States and such territories are 
called Union Territories. 
The two levels of Government divide and share the totality of governmental 
functions and powers between themselves. A federal constitution thus envisages a 
division of governmental functions and powers between the centre and the regions by 
the sanction of the Constitution. 
Chapter I of Part XI (Articles 245 to 255) of the Indian Constitution read with 
Seventh Schedule thereto covers the legislative relationship between the Union and 
the States. In analysis of  these provisions reveals that the entire legislative sphere 
has been divided on the basis of: 
(a) territory with respect to which the laws are to be made, and 
(b) subject matter on which laws are to be made. 
2.  Territorial Distribution 
The Union Legislature, i.e., Parliament has the power to make laws for the whole 
of the territory of India or any part thereof, and the State Legislatures have the power 
to make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of the respective States. Thus, 
while the laws of the Union can be enforced throughout the territory of India, the laws 
of a State cannot be operative beyond the territorial limits of that States. For example, 
a law passed by the legislature of the Punjab State cannot be made applicable to the 
 
EP-GCL-1 
47
State of Uttar Pradesh or any other state. However, this simple generalisation of 
territorial division of legislative jurisdiction is subject to the following clarification. 
(A)  Parliament 
From the territorial point of view, Parliament, being supreme legislative body, 
may make laws for the whole of India; or any part thereof; and it can also make laws 
which may have their application even beyond the territory of India. A law made by 
Parliament is not invalid merely because it has an extra-territorial operation. As 
explained by Kania C.J. in A.H. Wadia v. Income-tax Commissioner, A.I.R. 1949 F.C. 
18, 25 ―In the case of sovereign Legislature, questions of extra-territoriality of any 
enactment can never be raised in the municipal courts as a ground for challenging its 
validity. The legislation may offend the rules of International law, may not be 
recognised by foreign courts, or there may be practical difficulties in enforcing them 
but these are questions of policy with which the domestic tribunals are not 
concerned‖. 
A Union Territory is administered directly by the Central Executive. Article 239(1) 
provides save as otherwise provided, by Parliament by law, every Union Territory 
shall be administered by the President acting, to such extent as he thinks fit, through 
an Administrator to be appointed by him with such designation as he may specify. 
Article 239A empowers Parliament to create local Legislatures or Council of Ministers 
or both for certain Union Territories with such constitutional powers and functions, in 
each case, as may be specified in the law. Article 246(4) provides that Parliament 
can make a law for a Union Territory with respect to any matter, even if it is one 
which is enumerated in the State List. With regard to Union Territories, there is no 
distribution of legislative powers. Parliament has thus plenary powers to legislate for 
the Union Territories with regard to any subject. These powers are, however, subject 
to some special provisions of the Constitution. 
(B)  State Legislature 
A State Legislature may make laws only for the state concerned. It can also 
make laws which may extend beyond the territory of that State. But such law can be 
valid only on the basis of ―territorial nexus‖. That is, if there is sufficient nexus or 
connection between the State and the subject matter of the law which falls beyond 
the territory of the State, the law will be valid. The sufficiency of the nexus is to be 
seen on the basis of the test laid down by our Supreme Court in State of 
Bombay v. R.M.D.C., A.I.R. 1957 S.C. 699, according to which two conditions, 
must be fulfilled: 
 
(i) the  connection must be real and not illusory; and 
 (ii) the liability sought to be imposed by that law must be pertinent to that 
connection. 
If both the conditions are fulfilled by a law simultaneously then only it is valid 
otherwise not. To illustrate, in the case cited above a newspaper in the name of 
―Sporting Star‖ was published and printed at Bangalore in Mysore (now Karnataka) 
State. It contained crossword puzzles and engaged in prize competitions. It had wide 
circulation in the State of Bombay (now Maharashtra) and most of its activities such 
as the standing invitations, the filling up of the forms and the payment of money took 
place within that State. The State of Bombay imposed a tax on the newspaper. The 
EP-GCL-1 
48
publishers challenged the validity of the law on the ground that it was invalid in so far 
it covered a subject matter falling beyond the territory of that State because the paper 
was published in another State. The Supreme Court, applying the doctrine of 
territorial nexus, held that the nexus was sufficient between the law and its subject-
matter to justify the imposition of the tax. So in this way, the state laws may also have 
a limited extra-territorial operation and it is not necessary that such law should be 
only one relating to tax-matters. 
3.  Distribution of Subject Matter of Legislation 
In distributing the subjects on which legislation can be made, different constitutions 
have adopted different pattern. For example, in the U.S.A. there is only one short list on 
the subject. Either by their express terms or by necessary implication some of them are 
exclusively assigned to the Central Government and the others concurrent on which 
Centre and the States both can make laws. The subjects not enumerated in this list, 
i.e., residuary subjects, have been left for the States. Similar pattern has been followed 
in Australia but there is one short list in which a few subjects have been exclusively 
assigned to the Centre and there is a  a longer list in which those subjects are 
enumerated on which Centre and States both can make laws. By necessary implication 
a few of these concurrent subject have  also become exclusively Central subjects. The 
unenumerated subjects fall exclusively within the State jurisdiction. A different pattern 
has been adopted in Canada where there are three lists of subjects, one consists of 
subjects exclusively belonging to the Centre, the other consists of those exclusively 
belonging to the States and the third where both can make law. Thus residuary 
subjects fall within the central jurisdiction. The Government of India Act, 1935 followed 
the Canadian pattern subject to the modification that here the lists of subjects were 
much more detailed as compared to those in the Canadian Constitution and secondly, 
the residuary subjects had been left to the discretion of the Governor-General which he 
could assign either to Centre or to the States. 
The Constitution of India, substantially follows the pattern of the Government of 
India Act, 1935 subject to the modification that the residuary subjects have been left 
for the Union as in Canada. To understand the whole scheme, the Constitution draws 
three long lists of all the conceivable legislative subjects. These lists are contained in 
the VIIth Schedule to the Constitution. List I is named as the Union List. List II as the 
State List and III as the Concurrent List. Each list contains a number of entries in 
which the subjects of legislation have been separately and distinctly mentioned. The 
number of entries in the respective lists is 97, 66 and 47. The subjects included in 
each of the lists have been drawn on certain basic considerations and not arbitrarily 
or in any haphazard manner.  
Thus, those subjects which are of national interest or importance, or which need 
national control and uniformity of policy throughout the country have been included in 
the Union List; the subjects which are of local or regional interest and on which local 
control is more expedient, have been assigned to the State List and those subjects 
which ordinarily are of local interest yet need uniformity on national level or at least 
with respect to  some parts of the country, i.e., with respect, to more than one State 
have been allotted to the Concurrent List. To illustrate, defence of India, naval, 
military and air forces; atomic energy, foreign affairs, war and peace, railways, posts 
and  telegraphs, currency, coinage and legal tender; foreign loans; Reserve Bank of 
India; trade and commerce with foreign countries; import and export across customs 
frontiers; inter-State trade and commerce, banking; industrial disputes concerning 
 
EP-GCL-1 
49
? 
Union employees; coordination and determination  of Standards in institutions for 
higher education are some of the subjects in the Union List. Public Order; police; 
prisons; local Government; public health and sanitation; trade and commerce within 
the State; markets and fairs; betting and gambling etc., are some of the subjects 
included in the State List. And coming to the Concurrent List, Criminal law; marriage 
and divorce; transfer of property; contracts; economic and social planning; 
commercial and industrial insurance; monopolies; social security and social 
insurance; legal, medical and other professions; price control, electricity; acquisition 
and requisition of property are some of the illustrative matters included in the  
Concurrent List. 
Apart from this enumeration of subjects, there are a few notable points with 
respect to these lists, e.g.: 
 
(i) The entries relating to tax have been separated from other subjects and thus 
if a subject is included in any particular List it does not mean the power to 
impose tax with respect to that also follows. Apart from that, while other 
subjects are in the first part of the List in one group, the subjects relating to 
tax are given towards the end of the List. 
 (ii) Subject-matter of tax is enumerated only in the Union List and the State List. 
There is no tax subject included in the Concurrent List. 
 (iii) In each List there is an entry of ―fees‖ with respect to any matter included in 
that List excluding court fee. This entry is the last in all the Lists except List I 
where it is last but one. 
 (iv) There is an entry each in Lists I and II relating to ―offences against laws with 
respect to any of the matters‖ included in the respective List while criminal 
law is a general subject in the Concurrent List. 
So far we have discussed the general aspect of the subject matters of legislation 
or of the items on which Legislation could be passed. The next question that arises is, 
who will legislate on which subject? Whether, it is both Centre and the States that can 
make laws on all subjects included in the three Lists or there is some division of 
power between the two to make laws on these subjects? The answer is that the 
Constitution makes clear arrangements as to how the powers shall be exercised by 
the Parliament or the State Legislatures on these subjects. That arrangement is 
mainly contained in Article 246, but in addition to that, provisions have also been 
made in Articles 247 to 254 of the Constitution. A wholesome picture of this 
arrangement is briefly given below.

4. 
Legislative Powers of the Union and the States with respect to Legislative 
Subjects 
The arrangement for the operation of legislative powers of the Centre and the 
States with respect to different subjects of legislation is as follows: 
 (a) With respect to the subject enumerated in the Union i.e., List I, the Union 
Parliament has the exclusive power to make laws. The State Legislature has 
no power to make laws on any of these subjects and it is immaterial whether 
Parliament has exercised its power by making a law or not. Moreover, this 
power of parliament to make laws on subjects included in the Union List is 
notwithstanding the power of the States to make laws either on the subjects 
included in the State List or the Concurrent List. If by any stretch of 
imagination or because of some mistake — which is not expected — the 
same subject which is included in the Union List is also covered in the  State 
List, in such a situation that subject shall be read only in List I and not in List 
II or List III. By this principle the superiority of the Union List over the other 
two has been recognised. 
 (b) With respect to the subjects enumerated in the State List, i.e., List II, the 
legislature of a State has exclusive power to make laws. Therefore 
Parliament cannot make any law on any of these subjects, whether the State 
makes or does not make any law. 
 (c) With respect to the subjects enumerated in the Concurrent List, i.e., List III, 
Parliament and the State Legislatures both have powers to make laws. Thus, 
both of them can make a law even with respect to the same subject and both 
the laws shall be valid in so far as they are not repugnant to each other. 
However, in case of repugnancy, i.e., when there is a conflict between such 
laws then the law made by Parliament shall prevail over the law made by the 
State Legislature and the latter will be valid only to the extent to which it is 
not repugnant to the former. It is almost a universal rule in all the 
Constitutions where distribution of legislative powers is provided that in the 
concurrent field the Central law prevails if it conflicts with a State law. 
However, our Constitution recognises an exception to this general or 
universal rule. The exception is that if there is already a law of Parliament on 
any subject enumerated in the Concurrent List and a state also wants to 
make a law on the same subject then a State can do so provided that law 
has been reserved for the consideration of the President of India and has 
received his assent. Such law shall prevail in that State over the law of 
Parliament if there is any conflict between the two. However, Parliament can 
get rid of such law at any time by passing a new law and can modify by 
amending or repealing the law of the State. 
 (d) With respect to all those matters which are not included in any of the three 
lists, Parliament has the exclusive power to make laws. It is called the 
residuary legislative power of Parliament. The Supreme Court has  held that 
the power to impose wealth-tax on the total wealth of a person including his 
agricultural land belongs to Parliament in its residuary jurisdiction (Union of 
India v. H.S. Dhillon, A.I.R. 1972 S.C. 1061).

5.  Power of Parliament to make Laws on State List 
We have just discussed that the State legislatures have the exclusive powers to 
make laws with respect to the subjects included in the State List and Parliament has 
no power to encroach upon them. However, our Constitution makes a few exceptions 
to this general rule by authorising Parliament to make law even on the subjects 
enumerated in the State List. Following are the exceptions which the Constitution so 
recognises: 
(a)  In the National Interest (Article 249) 
Parliament can make a law with respect to a matter enumerated in the State List 
if the Council of States declares by a resolution supporetd by two-thirds of its 
members present and voting, that it is necessary or expedient in the national interest 
that Parliament should make a law on that matter. By such declaration Parliament 
gets the authority to legislate on that matter for the whole or part of the country so 
long as the resolution of the Council of States remains in force. But such resolution 
shall remain in force for a period not exceeding one year. However, a fresh resolution 
can be passed a the end of one year to give extended lease to the law of Parliament 
and that way the law of Parliament can be continued to remain in force for any 
number of years. 
The laws passed by Parliament under the provision cease to have effect 
automatically after six months of the expiry of the resolution period. Beyond that date, 
such Parliamentary law becomes inoperative except as regards the thing done or 
omitted to be done before the expiry of that law. 
(b)  During a proclamation of emergency (Article 250) 
While a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, Article 250 of the Constitution 
of India removes restrictions on the legislative authority of the Union Legislature in 
relation to the subjects enumerated in the State List. Thus, during emergency, 
Parliament shall have power to make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of 
India with respect to all matters in the State List. These laws will cease to have effect 
on the expiration of six months after the proclamation ceases to operate. After that 
date, such union laws shall become inoperative, except in respect of things done or 
omitted to be done before the expiry of the said period. Under Article 352, if the  
President is satisfied that a grave emergency exists where-by the security of India or 
any part of the territory thereof is threatened whether by war, or external aggression 
or armed rebellion, he may by proclamation make a declaration to that effect in 
EP-GCL-1 
52
respect of the whole of India or of such part of the territory thereof as may be 
specified in the proclamation. It is not necessary that there is an actual war or  armed 
rebellion. It is enough that the President is satisfied that there is an imminent danger 
of such war or armed rebellion as the case may be. The proclamation of emergency 
shall not be issued except when the decision of the union cabinet that such 
proclamation may be issued, has been communicated to the President in writing. 
Every such proclamation shall be laid before each House of Parliament and unless it 
is approved by both the Houses by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the 
members present and voting within a period of 30 days thereof, such proclamation 
shall cease to operate. If any such proclamatioin is issued at a time when the House 
of People (Lok Sabha) has been dissolved, or the dissolution of the House of People 
takes place during the period of one month referred to above but before passing the 
resolution, and if a resolution approving the proclamation has been passed by the 
Council of State (Rajya Sabha), the proclamation shall cease to operate at the expiry 
of thirty days from the date on which the House of the People (Lok Sabha) first sits 
after it‘s reconstitution, unless before the expiration of the said period of thirty days a 
resolution approving the proclamation has also passed by the House of the People. 
A proclamation so approved shall, unless revoked, cease to operate on the 
expiration of a period of six months from the date of passing of the second resolution 
approving the proclamation. But this period of six months may be extended by a 
further period of six months, if, within the first six months, both the Houses of 
Parliament pass a resolution approving the continuance in force of such 
proclamation. Prior to the Constitution 44th Amendment Act, the position was that the 
proclamation when approved by both the Houses of Parliament would remain in the 
force for an indefinite period unless and until the President chose to revoke the 
proclamation in exercise of the power conferred by the then Article 352(2)(a). 
Article 353 provides that while a proclamation of emergency is in operation, the 
Parliament shall have the power to make laws conferring powers and imposing duties 
or authorising the conferring of powers and the imposition of duties upon the Union or 
officers and authorities of the Union as respects that matter, notwithstanding, that it is 
one which is not enumerated in the Union List. 
(c)  Breakdown of Constitutional Machinery in a State (Article 356 and 357) 
In case the Governor of a State reports to the President, or he is otherwise 
satisfied that the Government of a State cannot be carried on according to the 
provisions of the Constitution, then he (President) can make a proclamation to that 
effect. By that proclamation, he can assume to himself all or any of the functions of 
the Government of the State and all or any of the powers vested in or exercisable by 
the Governor or any body or authority in the State, and  declare that the powers of 
Legislature of that State shall vest in Parliament. Parliament can make laws with 
respect to all state matters as regards the particular state in which there is a 
breakdown of constitutional machinery and is under the President‘s rule. Further it is 
not necessary that the legislature of the concerned state should be suspended or 
dissolved before it is brought under the President‘s rule, but practically it so happens. 
It is important to note that the President cannot, however, assume to himself any of 
the powers vested in or exercisable by a High Court or to suspend, either in whole or 
in part, the operation of any provision of the Constitution relating to the High Courts. 
Under the Constitution of India, the power is really that of the Union Council of 
 
EP-GCL-1 
53
Ministers with the Prime Minister as its head. The satisfaction of the President 
contemplated by this Article is subjective in nature. The power conferred by Article 
356 upon the President is a conditional power. It is not an absolute power. The 
existence of material-which may comprise of, or include, the report(s) of the Governor 
— is a pre-condition. The satisfaction must be formed on relevant materials. Though 
the power of dissolving the Legislative Assembly can be said to be implicit in Clause 
(1) of Article 356, it must be held, having regard to the overall Constitutional scheme 
that the President shall exercise it only after the proclamation is approved by both the 
Houses of Parliament under Clause (3) and not before. Until such approval, the 
President  can only suspend the Legislative Assembly by suspending the provisions 
of the Constitution relating to the Legislative Assembly under Sub-clause (c) of 
Clause (1). The proclamation under Clause (1) can be issued only where the situation 
contemplated by the clause arises. Clause (3) of Article 356, is conceived as a 
control on the power of the President and also as a safeguard against its abuse (S.R. 
Bommai v. Union of India, AIR 1994 SC 1918). 
Clause 2 of Article 356 provides that any such proclamation may be revoked or 
varied by a subsequent proclamation. It may, however, be noted that the presidential 
proclamation is valid only for six months at a time and that also if  approved by both 
the Houses of Parliament within a period of two months from the date of 
proclamation. A fresh proclamation can be issued to extend the life of the existing 
one for a further period of six months but in no case such proclamation can remain in 
force beyond a consecutive period of three years. The Constitution (Fourty-Second) 
Amendment Act, 1976 inserted a new clause (2) in Article 357. It provides that any 
law made in exercise of the Power of the Legislature of the State by Parliament or the 
President or other Authority referred to in Sub-clause (a) of Clause (1) which 
Parliament or the President or such other Authority would not, but for the issue of a 
proclamation under Article 356 have been competent to make shall, after the 
proclamation has ceased to operate, continue in force until altered, or repealed or 
amended by a competent Legislature or other authority. This means that the laws 
made during the subsistence of the proclamation shall continue to be in force unless  
and until they are altered or repealed by the State Legislature. So an express 
negative act is required in order to put an end to the operation of the laws made in 
respect of that State by the Union. 
The action of the President  under Article 356 is a constitutional function and the 
same is subject to judicial review. The Supreme Court or High Court can  strike down 
the proclamation if it is found to be mala fide or based on wholly irrelevant or 
extraneous grounds. If the Court strikes down the proclamation, it has the power to 
restore the dismissed government to office and revive and reactivate the Legislative 
Assembly wherever it may have been dissolved or kept under suspension. (see S.R. 
Bommai's case). 
(d) On the request of two or more States (Article 252) 
Article 252 of the Constitution enumerates the power of Parliament to legislate for 
state. The exercise of such power is conditional upon an agreement between two or 
more States requesting Parliament to legislate for them on a specified subject. This 
article provides that, if two or more States are desirous that on any particular item 
included in the State List there should be a common legislation applicable to all such 
States then they can make a request to Parliament to make such law on that 
particular subject. Such request shall be made by passing a resolution in the 
EP-GCL-1 
54
legislatures of the State concerned. If request is made in that form then parliament 
can make law on that subject as regards those States. The law so made may be 
adopted by other States also, by passing resolutions in their legislatures. Once, 
however, such law has been made, the power of those State legislatures which 
originally requested or which later on adopted such law is curtailed as regards that 
matter; and only Parliament can amend, modify or repeal such a law on similar 
request being made by any State or States. If any of the consenting States makes a 
law on that subject then its law will be invalid to the extent to which it is inconsistent 
with a law of Parliament. 
To take an example, Parliament passed the Prize Competitions Act, 1955 under 
the provisions of the Constitution. 
(e) Legislation for enforcing international agreements (Article 253) 
Parliament has exclusive power with respect to foreign affairs and entering into 
treaties and agreements with foreign countries and implementing of treaties and 
agreements and conventions with foreign countries. But a treaty or agreement 
concluded with another country may require national implementation and for that 
purpose a law may be needed. To meet such difficulties, the Constitution authorises 
Parliament to make law on any subject included in any list to implement: 
 
(i) any treaty, agreement or convention with any other country or countries, or  
 (ii) any decision made at any international conference, association or other 
body. 
These five exceptions to the general scheme of distribution of legislative powers 
on the basis of exclusive Union and State Lists go to show that in our Constitution 
there is nothing which makes the States totally immune from legislative interference 
by the Centre in any matter. There remains no subject in the exclusive State 
jurisdiction which cannot be approached by the Centre in certain situations. But by 
this, one must not conclude that the distribution of legislative power in our 
Constitution is just illusory and all the powers vest in the Centre. On the other hand, 
the distribution of legislative powers is real and that is the general rule but to face the 
practical difficulties the Constitution had made a few exceptions which are to operate 
within the circumscribed sphere and  conditions. 
6.  Interpretation of the Legislative Lists 
For giving effect to the various items in the different lists the Courts have applied 
mainly the following principles : 
 (a) Plenary Powers:  The first and foremost rule is that if legislative power is 
granted with respect to a subject and there are no limitations imposed on the 
power, then it is to be given the widest scope that its words are capable of, 
without, rendering another item nugatory. In the words of Gajenderagadkar, 
C.J. 
 
 “It is an elementary cardinal rule of interpretation that the words used 
in the Constitution which confer legislative power must receive the 
most liberal construction and if they are words of wide amplitude, they 
must be interpreted so as to give effect to that amplitude. A general 
word used in an entry ... must be construed to extend to all ancillary or 
 
EP-GCL-1 
55
subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be held to be 
included in it (Jagannath Baksh Singh v. State of U.P., AIR 1962 SC 
1563). 
 
 Thus, a legislature to which a power is granted over a particular subject may 
make law on any aspect or on all aspects of it; it can make a retrospective 
law or a prospective law and it can also make law on all matters ancillary to 
that matter. For example, if power to collect taxes is granted to a legislature, 
the power not to collect taxes or the power to remit taxes shall be presumed 
to be included within the power to collect taxes. 
 (b) Harmonious Construction: Different entries in the different lists are to be 
interpreted in such a way that a conflict between them is avoided and each of 
them is given effect. It must be accepted that the Constitution does not want 
to create conflict and make any entry nugatory. Therefore, when there 
appears a conflict between two entries in the two different lists the two entries 
should be so interpreted, that each of them is given effect and, for that 
purpose the scope and meaning of one may be restricted so as to give 
meaning to the other also. 
 (c) Pith and Substance Rule: The rule of pith and substance means that where a 
law in reality and substance falls within an item on which the legislature 
which enacted that law is competent to legislate, then such law shall not 
become invalid merely because it incidentally touches a matter outside the 
competence of legislature. In a federal Constitution, as was observed by 
Gwyer C.J. ―it must inevitably happen from time to time that legislation 
though purporting to deal with a subject in one list touches also upon a 
subject in another list, and the different provisions of the enactment may be 
so closely intertwined that blind adherence to a strictly verbal interpretation 
would result in a large number of statutes being declared invalid because the 
legislature enacting them may appear to have legislated in a forbidden 
sphere‖ (Prafulla Kumar v. Bank of Khulna, AIR 1947 PC 60). Therefore, 
where such overlapping occurs, the question must be asked, what is, ―pith 
and substance‖ of the enactment in question and in which list its true nature 
and character is to be found. For this purpose the enactment as a whole with 
its object and effect must be considered. By way of illustration, acting on 
entry 6 of List II which reads ―Public Health and Sanitation‖. Rajasthan 
Legislature passed a law restricting the use of sound amplifiers. The law was 
challenged on the ground that it dealt with a matter which fell in entry 81 of 
List I which reads: ―Post and telegraphs, telephones, wireless broadcasting 
and other like forms of communication‖, and, therefore, the State Legislature 
was not competent to pass it. The Supreme Court rejected this argument on 
the ground that the object of the law was to prohibit unnecessary noise 
affecting the health of public and not to make a law on broadcasting, etc. 
Therefore, the pith and substance of the law was ―public health‖ and not 
―broadcasting‖ (G. Chawla v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1959 SC 544). 
 (d) Colourable Legislation: It is, in a way, a rule of interpretation almost opposite 
to the one discussed above. The Constitution does not allow any 
transgression of power by any legislature, either directly or indirectly. 
However, a legislature may pass a law in such a way that it gives it a colour 
of constitutionality while, in reality, that law aims at achieving something 
EP-GCL-1 
56
? 
which the legislature could not do. Such legislation is called colourable piece 
of legislation and is invalid. To take an example in Kameshwar Singh v. 
State of Bihar, A.I.R. 1952 S.C. 252, the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950 
provided that the unpaid rents by the tenants shall vest in the state and 
one half of them shall be paid back by the State to the landlord or 
zamindar as compensation for acquisition of unpaid rents. According to 
the provision in the State List under which the above law was passed, 
no property should be acquired  without payment of compensation. The 
question was whether the taking of the whole unpaid rents and then 
returning half of them back to them  who were entitled to claim, (i.e., the 
landlords) is a law which provides for compensatioin. The Supreme 
Court found that this was a colourable exercise of power of acquisition 
by the State legislature, because “the taking of the whole and returning 
a half means nothing more or less than taking of without any return and 
this is naked confiscation, no matter in whatever specious form it may 
be clothed or disguised”. 
 
 The motive of the legislature is, however, irrelevant for the application of this 
doctrine. Therefore, if a legislature is authorised to do a particular thing 
directly or indirectly, then it is totally irrelevant as to with what motives — 
good or bad — it did that. 
 
 These are just few guiding principles which the Courts have evolved, to 
resolve the disputes which may arise about the competence of law passed by 
Parliament or by any State Legislature.

VII.  FREEDOM OF TRADE, COMMERCE AND INTERCOURSE 
This heading has been given to Part XIII of the Constitution. This part originally 
consisted of seven articles — Articles 301 to 307 — of which one (Art. 306) has been 
repealed. Out of these articles it is the first, i.e., 301 which, in real sense, creates an 
overall comprehensive limitation on all legislative powers of the Union and the State 
which affect the matters covered by that Article. This Article guarantees the freedom 
of trade, commerce and intercourse and runs in the following words: 
―Subject to the other provisions of this Part, trade, commerce and intercourse 
throughout the territory of India shall be free‖. 
The opening words of this Article clearly show, and it has been so held by the 
Supreme Court, that except the provisions contained under this Part, i.e., Articles 302 
 
EP-GCL-1 
57
to 307 under no other provision of the Constitution the free flow of trade and 
commerce can be interfered with. The object of the freedom declared by this Article is 
to ensure that the economic unity of India may not be broken by internal barriers. 
The concept of trade, commerce and intercourse today is so wide that from 
ordinary sale and purchase it includes broadcasting on radios, communication on 
telephone and even to non-commercial movement from one place to another place. If 
such is the scope of trade and commerce then any law relating to any matter may 
affect the freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse, e.g., it may be said that the 
law which imposes the condition of licence for having a radio violates the freedom of 
trade and commerce, or a law which regulates the hours during which the electricity 
in a particular locality shall be available may be called as affecting the freedom of 
trade and commerce because during those hours one cannot use the radio or 
television or one cannot run this factory. If that view is taken then every law shall 
become contrary to Articles 301 and unless saved by Articles 302 to 307 shall be 
unconstitutional. To avoid such situations the Supreme Court in the very first 
case on the matter (Atiabari Tea Co. v. State of Assam, A.I.R. 1951 S.C. 232) 
declared that only those laws which “directly and immediately” restrict or 
impede the freedom of trade and commerce are covered by Article 301 and 
such laws which directly and incidentally affect the freedom guaranteed in that 
article are not within the reach of Article 301. The word ‗intercourse‘ in this article 
is of wide import. It will cover all such intercourse as might not be included in the 
words ‗trade and commerce‘. Thus, it would cover movement and dealings even of a 
non-commercial nature (Chobe v. Palnitkar, A.I.R. 1954 Hyd. 207). The word, free in 
Article 301 cannot mean an absolute freedom. Such measures as traffic regulations 
licensing of vehicles etc. are not open to challenge. 
It was further held in the next case (Automobile Transport Ltd. v. State of 
Raj., A.I.R. 1962 S.C. 1906) that regulations that facilitate the freedom of trade 
and commerce and compensatory taxes are also saved from the reach of 
Article 301. About compensatory taxes the Supreme Court has doubted the 
correctness of its own views in a later case Khyerbari Tea Co. v. State of Assam, 
A.I.R. 1964 S.C. 925.   
With respect to regulatory laws also, we may say that if they are the laws which 
facilitate the freedom of trade and commerce then they are not at all laws which 
impede the free flow of trade and commerce directly or indirectly. The freedom of 
trade and commerce guaranteed under Article 301 applies throughout the territory of 
India; it is not only to inter-state but also to intra-state trade commerce and 
intercourse. But in no way it covers the foreign trade or the trade beyond the territory 
of India. Therefore, the foreign trade is free from the restriction of Article 301.  
Trade and commerce which are protected by Article 301 are only those activities 
which are regarded as lawful trading activities and are not against policy. The 
Supreme Court held that gambling is not "trade". Similarly, prize competitions being 
of gambling in nature, cannot be regarded as trade or commerce and as such are not 
protected under Article 301 (State of Bombay v. RMDC, AIR 1957 SC 699). 
The freedom guaranteed by Article 301 is not made absolute and is to be read 
subject to the following exceptions as provided in Articles 302-305. 
EP-GCL-1 
58
(a)  Parliament to Impose Restriction in the Public Interest 
According to Article 302 Parliament may, by law, impose such restrictions on the 
freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse as may be required in the public 
interest. 
(b)  Parliament to make Preference or Discrimination 
Parliament cannot by making any law give preference to one State over the other 
or make discrimination between the States except when it is declared by that law that 
it is necessary to do so for the purpose of dealing with a situation arising from scarcity 
of goods in any part of the territory of India [Article 303 (1) and (2)]. 
(c)  Power of the State Legislature 
The Legislature of a State may by law: 
 (a) impose on goods imported from other States or the Union territories any tax 
to which similar goods manufactured or produced in that State are subject, 
so, however, as not to discriminate between goods so imported and goods so 
manufactured or produced; and 
 (b) impose such reasonable restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce or 
intercourse within the State as may be required in the public interest.  
 
 However, no bill or amendment for making a law falling in this provision can 
be introduced or moved in the Legislature of a State without the previous 
sanction of the President. [Article 304] 
 
 In Kalyani Stores v. State of Orissa, Supreme Court held that Article 304 
enables State legislature to impose taxes on goods from other States, if 
goods produced within the state are subjected to such taxes. A subsequent 
assent of President is also sufficient, as held in Karnataka v. Hansa Corpn., 
(1981) SC 463. 
(d)  Saving of Existing Laws 
The law which was already in force at the commencement of the Constitution 
shall not be affected by the provisions of Article 301 except in so far as the President 
may, by order, otherwise direct (Art 305). 
(e)  Saving of Laws providing for State Monopoly 
The laws which create State monopoly in any trade, etc. are saved from attack 
under Article 301, i.e., they are valid irrespective of the fact that they directly impede 
or restrict the freedom of trade and commerce. So, if the State creates a monopoly in 
road, transporters cannot complain that their freedom of trade and commerce has 
been affected or if the State created monopoly in banking then other bankers cannot 
complain that their freedom of trade and commerce has been restricted. 
The last provision (Article 307) in Part XIII which need not even be mentioned 
except by way of information authorises Parliament to appoint by law such authority 
as it considers appropriate for carrying out purposes of Articles 301 to 304 and to 
confer on the authority so appointed such powers and duties as it thinks necessary. 
 
EP-GCL-1

VIII.  CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO STATE MONOPOLY 
Creation of monopoly rights in favour of a person or body of persons to carry on 
any business prima facie affects the freedom of trade. But in certain circumstances it 
can be justified. 
After the Constitution (Amendment) Act, 1951, the States create a monopoly in 
favour of itself, without being called upon to justify its action in the Court as being 
reasonable. 
Sub-clause (ii) of clause (6) of Article 19 makes it clear that the freedom of 
profession, trade or business will not be understood to mean to prevent the state from 
undertaking either directly or through a corporation owned or controlled by it, any 
trade, business, industry or service, whether to the exclusion, complete or partial, 
citizens or otherwise. 
If a law is passed creating a State monopoly the Court should enquire what are 
the provisions of the said law which are basically and essentially necessary for 
creating the state monopoly. Sub-clause (ii) of clause (6) protects only the essential 
and basic provisions. If there are other provisions which are subsidiary or 
incidential to the operation of the monopoly they do not fall under Article 19(6)(ii). It 
was held by Shah, J. in R.C. Cooper v. Union of India, (1970) 1 SCC 248 
(known as Bank Nationalisation case), that the impugned law which 
prohibited the named banks from carrying the banking business was a 
necessary incident of the business assumed by the Union and hence was not 
liable to be challenged under Article 19(6)(ii) in so far as it affected the right 
of a citizen to carry on business. 
IX. THE JUDICIARY 
Courts 
The Supreme Court 
The Courts in the Indian legal system, broadly speaking, consist of (i) the Supreme 
Court, (ii) the High Courts, and (iii) the subordinate courts. The Supreme Court, which 
is the highest Court in the country (both for matters of ordinary law and for interpreting 
the Constitution) is an institution created by the Constitution. Immediately before 
independence, the Privy Council was the highest appellate authority for British India, for 
matters arising under ordinary law. But appeals from High Courts in constitutional 
matters lay to the Federal Court (created under the Government of India Act, 1935) and 
then to the Privy Council. The Supreme Court of India, in this sense, has inherited the 
jurisdiction of both the Privy Council and the Federal Court. However, the jurisdiction of 
the Supreme Court under the present Constitution is much more extensive than that of 
its two predecessors mentioned above. 
The Supreme Court, entertains appeals (in civil and criminal and other cases) 
from High Courts and certain Tribunals. It has also writ jurisdiction for enforcing 
Fundamental Rights. It can advise the President on a reference made by the 
President on questions of fact and law. It has a variety of other special jurisdictions. 
High Courts 
The High Courts that function under the Constitution were not created for the first 
time by the Constitution. Some High Courts existed before the Constitution, although 
EP-GCL-1 
60
some new High Courts have been created after 1950. The High Courts in (British) 
India were established first under the Indian High Courts Act, 1861 (an Act of the U.K. 
Parliament). The remaining High Courts were established or continued under the 
Constitution or under special Acts. High Courts for each State (or Group of States) 
have appellate, civil and criminal jurisdiction over lower Courts. High Courts have writ 
jurisdiction to enforce fundamental rights and for certain other purposes. 
Some High Courts (notably) Bombay, Calcutta and Delhi, have ordinary original 
civil jurisdiction (i.e. jurisdiction to try regular civil suits) for their respective cities. High 
Courts can also hear references made by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal under 
the Income Tax Act and other tribunals. 
It should be added, that the "writ" jurisdiction vested at present in all High Courts 
by the Constitution was (before the Constitution came into force) vested only in the 
High Courts of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras (i.e. the three Presidency towns). 
Subordinate Courts 
Finally, there are various subordinate civil and criminal courts (original and 
appellate), functioning under ordinary law. Although their nomenclature and powers 
have undergone change from time to time, the basic pattern remains the same. These 
have been created, not under the Constitution, but under laws of the competent 
legislature. Civil Courts are created mostly under the Civil Courts Act of each State. 
Criminal courts are created mainly under the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
Civil Courts 
In each district, there is a District Court presided over by the District Judge, with a 
number of Additional District Judges attached to the court. Below that Court are 
Courts of Judges (sometimes called subordinate Judges) and in, some States, 
Munsiffs. These Courts are created under State Laws. 
Criminal Courts 
Criminal courts in India primarily consist of the Magistrate and the Courts of 
Session. Magistrates themselves have been divided by the Code of Criminal 
Procedure into 'Judicial' and 'Executive' Magistrates. The latter do not try criminal 
prosecutions, and their jurisdiction is confined to certain miscellaneous cases, which 
are of importance for public tranquillity and the like. Their proceedings do not end in 
conviction or acquittal, but in certain other types of restrictive orders. In some States, 
by local amendments, Executive Magistrates have been vested with powers to try 
certain offences. 
As regards Judicial Magistrates, they are of two classes : Second Class and First 
Class. Judicial Magistrates are subject to the control of the Court of Session, which 
also is itself a Court of original jurisdiction. The powers of Magistrates of the two 
classes vary, according to their grade. The Court of Session can try all offences, and 
has power to award any sentence, prescribed by law for the offence, but a sentence 
of death requires confirmation by the High Court. 
In some big cities (including the three Presidency towns and Ahmedabad and 
Delhi), the Magistrates are called Metropolitan Magistrates. There is no gradation 
inter se. Further, in some big cities (including the three Presidency towns and 
Ahmedabad and Hyderabad), the Sessions Court is called the "City Sessions Court", 
its powers being the same as those of the Courts of Session in the districts.

Special Tribunals 
Besides these Courts, which form part of the general judicial set up, there are 
hosts of specialised tribunals dealing with direct taxes, labour, excise and customs, 
claims for accidents caused by motor vehicles, copyright and monopolies and 
restrictive trade practices. 
For the trial of cases of corruption, there are Special Judges, appointed under the 
Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1952.

X.  WRIT JURISDICTION OF HIGH COURTS AND SUPREME COURT 
In the words of Dicey, prerogative writs are ‘the bulwark of English Liberty’. The 
expression ‗prerogative writ‘ is one of Engish common law which refers to the 
extraordinary writs granted by the sovereign, as fountain of justice on the ground of 
inadequacy of ordinary legal remedies. In course of time these writs were issued by 
the High Court as extraordinary remedies in cases where there was either no remedy 
available under the ordinary law or the remedy available was inadequate. Under the 
Constitution by virtue of Article 226, every High Court has the power to issue 
directions or orders or writs including writs in the nature of Habeas corpus, 
Mandamus, Prohibition, Quo warranto and Certiorari or any of them for the 
enforcement of fundamental rights stipulated in Part III of the Constitution or for any 
other purpose.This power is exercisable by each High Court throughout the territory 
in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction. Where an  effective remedy is available, 
the High Court should not readily entertain a petition under Article 226 of the 
constitution of India e.g. under the Companies Act, a share holder has very effective 
remedies for prevention of oppression and mismanagement. Consequently High 
Court should not entertain a petition under the said Article (Ramdas Motors Transport 
Company Limited v. T.A. Reddy, AIR 1997 SC 2189). 
The Supreme Court could be moved by appropriate proceedings for the issue of 
directions or orders or writs, as referred to under Article 226 for the enforcement of 
the rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution. Article 32 itself being a 
fundamental right, the Constitutional remedy of writ is available to anyone whose 
fundamental rights are infringed by state action. Thus we see the power of the High 
EP-GCL-1 
62
Courts to issue these writs is wider than that of the Supreme Court, Whereas: 
 (a) an application to a High Court under Article 226 will lie not only where some 
other limitation imposed by the Constitution, outside Part III, has been 
violated, but, an application under Article 32 shall not lie in any case unless 
the right infringed is ‗Fundamental Right‘ enumerated in Part III of the 
Constitution; 
 (b) while the Supreme Court can issue a writ against any person or Government 
within the territory of India, a High Court can, under Article 226, issue a writ 
against any person, Government or other authority only if such person or 
authority is physically resident or located within the territorial jurisdiction of 
the particular High Court or if the cause of action arises within such 
jurisdiction. 
As stated earlier, the Supreme Court has been assigned by the Constitution a 
special role as ―the protector and guarantor of fundamental rights‖ by Article 32 (1). 
Although the Constitution has provided for concurrent writ jurisdiction of the High 
Courts it is not necessary, that an aggrieved petitioner should first apply to the High 
Court and then to the Supreme Court (Romesh Thappar v. Madras). 
The jurisdiction of the High Court also extends to the enforcement of rights other 
than fundamental rights provided there is a public duty. The Supreme Courts 
jurisdiction to issue writs extends to all fundamental rights (Common Cause v Union 
of India, A.I.R. 1999 SC 2979). 
Types of Writs 
A brief discription  of the various types of writs is given below: 
1.  Habeas Corpus 
The writ of Habeas corpus - an effective bulwark of personal liberty – is a remedy 
available to a person who is confined without legal justification. The words ‗Habeas 
Corpus‘ literally mean ―to have the body‖. When a prima facie case for the issue of 
writ has been made then the Court issues a rule nisi upon the relevant authority to 
show cause why the writ should not be issued. This is in national order to let the 
Court know on what grounds he has been confined and to set him free if there is no 
justification for his detention. This writ has to be obeyed by the detaining authority by 
producing the person before the Court. Under Articles 32 and 226 any person can 
move for this writ to the Supreme Court and High Court respectively. The applicant 
may be the prisoner or any person acting on his behalf to safeguard his liberty for the 
issuance of the writ of Habeas Corpus as no man can be punished or deprived of his 
personal liberty except for violation of law and in the ordinary legal manner. An 
appeal to the Supreme Court of India may lie against an order granting or rejecting 
the application (Articles 132, 134 or 136). The disobedience to this writ is met with by 
punishment for contempt of Court under the Contempt of Courts Act. 
2.  Mandamus 
The word ‗Mandamus’ literally means we command. The writ of mandamus is, a 
command issued to direct any person, corporation, inferior court, or Government 
requiring him or it do a particular thing specified therein which pertains to his or its 
office and is further in the nature of a public duty. This writ is used when the inferior 
 
EP-GCL-1 
63
tribunal has declined to exercise jurisdiction while resort to certiorari and prohibition 
arises when the tribunal has wrongly exercised jurisdiction or exceeded its jurisdiction 
and are available only against judicial and quasi-judicial bodies. Mandamus can be 
issued against any public authority. It commands activity. The writ is used for 
securing judicial enforcement of public duties. In a fit case, Court can direct 
executives to carry out Directive Principles of the Constitution through this writ (State 
of Maharashtra v. MP Vashi, 1995 (4) SCALE). The applicant must have a legal right 
to the performance of a legal duty by the person against whom the writ is prayed for. 
It is not issued if the authority has a discretion. 
The Constitution of India by Articles 226 and 32 enables mandamus to be issued 
by the High Courts and the Supreme Court to all authorities. 
Mandamus does not lie against the President or the Governor of a State for the 
exercise of their duties and power (Article 361). It does not lie also against a private 
individual or body except where the state is in collusion with such private party in the 
matter of contravention of any provision of the Constitution of a statute. It is a 
discretionary remedy and the High Court may refuse if alternative remedy exists 
except in case of infringement of fundamental rights. 
3.  Prohibition 
A writ of prohibition is issued to an Inferior Court preventing the latter from 
usurping jurisdiction which is not legally vested in it. When a tribunal acts without or in 
excess of jurisdiction, or in violation of rules or law, a writ of prohibition can be asked 
for. It is generally issued before the trial of the case. 
While mandamus commands activity, prohibition commands inactivity, it is 
available only against judicial or quasi judicial authorities and is not available against 
a public officer who is not vested with judicial functions. If abuse of power is apparent 
this writ may be of right and not a matter of discretion.  
4.  Certiorari 
It is available to any person, wherever any body of persons having legal authority 
to determine questions affecting the rights of subjects and having the duty to act 
judicially in excess of their legal authority‖ (See The King v. Electricity 
Commissioners, (1924) I.K.B. 171, P. 204-5).  
The writ removes the proceedings from such body to the High Court, to quash a 
decision that goes beyond its jurisdiction. Under the Constitution of India, all High 
Courts can issue the writ of certiorari throughout their territorial jurisdiction when the 
subordinate judicial authority acts (i) without or in excess of jurisdiction or in (ii) 
contravention of the rules of natural justice or (iii) commits an error apparent on the 
face of the record. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to issue such writs arises 
under Article 32. Although the object of both the writs of prohibition and of certiorari is 
the same, prohibition is available at an earlier stage whereas certiorari is available at 
a later stage but in similar grounds i.e. Certiorari is issued after authority has 
exercised its powers.  
5.  Quo Warranto 
The writ of quo warranto enables enquiry into the legality of the claim which a 
person asserts, to an office or franchise and to oust him from such position if he is an 
EP-GCL-1 
64
? 
usurper. The holder of the office has to show to the court under what authority he 
holds the office. It is issued when: 
 
(i) the office is of public and of a substantive nature, 
 (ii) created by statute or by the Constitution itself, and 
 (iii) the respondent has asserted his claim to the office. It can be issued even 
though he has not assumed the charge of the office. 
The fundamental basis of the proceeding of Quo warranto is that the public has 
an interest to see that a lawful claimant does not usurp a public office. It is a 
discretionary remedy which the court may grant or refuse.

XI.  DELEGATED LEGISLATION 
The increasing complexity of modern administration and the need for flexibility 
capable of rapid readjustment to meet changing circumstances which cannot always 
be foreseen, in implementing our socio-economic policies pursuant to the 
establishment of a welfare state as  contemplated by our Constitution, have made it 
necessary for the legislatures to delegate its powers. Further, the Parliamentary 
procedure and discussions in getting through a legislative measure in the 
Legislatures is usually time consuming. 
The three relevant justifications for delegated legislation are: 
 
(i) the limits of the time of the legislature; 
 (ii) the limits of the amplitude of the legislature, not merely its lack of 
competence but also its sheer inability to act in many situations, where 
direction is wanted; and 
 (iii) the need of some weapon for coping with situations created by emergency. 
The delegation of the legislative power is what Hughus, Chief Justice called, 
flexibility and practicability (Currin v. Wallace 83 L. ed. 441). 
 
EP-GCL-1 
65
Classification of delegated legislation 
The American writers classify delegated legislation as contingent and 
subordinate. Further, legislation is either supreme or subordinate. The Supreme Law  
or Legislation is that which proceeds from supreme or sovereign power in the state 
and is therefore incapable of being repealed, annulled or controlled by any other 
legislative authority. Subordinate legislation is that which proceeds from any authority 
other than the sovereign power, and is, therefore, dependent for its continued 
existence and validity on some sovereign or supreme authority. 
Classification of Subordinate Legislation 
1.  Executive Legislation 
The tendency of modern legislation has been in the direction of placing in the 
body of an Act only few general rules or statements and relegating details to statutory 
rules. This system empowers the executive to make rules and orders which do not 
require express confirmation by the legislature. Thus, the rules framed by the 
Government under the various Municipal Acts fall under the category. 
2.  Judicial Legislation 
Under various statues, the High Courts are authorised to frame rules for 
regulating the procedure to be followed in courts. Such rules have been framed by 
the High Courts under the Guardians of Wards Act, Insolvency Act, Succession Act 
and Companies Act, etc. 
3.  Municipal Legislation 
Municipal authorities are entrusted with limited and sub-ordinate powers of 
establishing special laws applicable to the whole or any part of the area under their 
administration known as bye-laws. 
4.  Autonomous Legislation 
Under this head fall the regulations which autonomus bodies such as Universities 
make in respect of matters which concern themselves. 
5.  Colonial Legislation 
The laws made by colonies under the control of some other nation, which are 
subject to supreme legislation of the country under whose control they are. 
Principles applicable 
A body, to which powers of subordinate legislation are delegated, must directly 
act within the powers which are conferred on it and it cannot act beyond its powers 
except to the extent justified by the doctrine of implied powers. The doctrine of 
implied powers means where the legislature has conferred any power, it must be 
deemed to have also granted any other power without which that power cannot be 
effectively exercised. 
Subordinate legislation can not take effect unless published. Therefore, there 
must be promulgation and publication in such cases. Although there is no rule as to 
any particular kind of publication. 
Conditional legislation is defined as a statute that provides controls but specifies 
that they are to come into effect only when a given administrative authority finds the 
existence of conditions defined in the statue. In other words in sub-ordinate 
EP-GCL-1 
66
? 
legislation the delegate completes the legislation by supplying details within the limits 
prescribed by the statute and in the case of conditional legislation, the power of 
legislation is exercised by the legislature conditionally, leaving to the discretion of an 
external authority, the time and manner of carrying its legislation into effect (Hamdard 
Dawa Khana v. Union of India, AIR, 1960 SC 554). 
While delegating the powers to an outside authority the legislature must act 
within the ambit of the powers defined by the Constitution and subject to the 
limitations prescribed thereby. If an Act is contrary to the provisions of the 
Constitution, it is void. Our Constitution embodies a doctrine of judicial review of 
legislation as to its conformity with the Constitution.

True 
 
False 
Correct answer: False 
 
In England, however, the position is different. Parliament in England may 
delegate to any extent and even all its power of law-making to an outside authority. In 
U.S.A., the Constitution embodies the doctrine of separation of powers, which 
prohibits the executive being given law making powers. On the question whether 
there is any limit beyond which delegation may not go in India, it was held in In 
re-Delhi Laws Act, 1912 AIR 1951 SC 332, that there is a limit that essential 
powers of legislation or essential legislative functions cannot be delegated. 
However, there is no specific provision in the Constitution prohibiting the 
delegation. On the question whether such doctrine is recognised in our 
Constitution, a number of principles in various judicial decisions have been 
laid down which are as follows: 
 (a) The primary duty of law-making has to be discharged by the Legislature 
itself. The Legislature cannot delegate its primary or essential 
legislative function to an outside authority in any case. 
 (b) The essential legislative function consists in laying down the „the policy 
of the law‟ and „making it a binding rule of conduct‟. The legislature, in 
other words must itself lay down the legislative policy and principles 
and must afford sufficient guidance to the rule-making authority for 
carrying out the declared policy. 
 (c) If the legislature has performed its essential function of laying down the 
policy of the law and providing guidance for carrying out the policy, 
there is no constitutional bar against delegation of subsidiary or 
ancillary powers in that behalf to an outside authority. 
 
EP-GCL-1 
67
 (d) It follows from the above that an Act delegating law-making powers to a 
person or body shall be invalid, if it lays down no principles and 
provides no standard for the guidance of the rule-making body. 
 (e) In applying this test the court could take into account the statement in 
the preamble to the act and if said statements afford a satisfactory 
basis for holding that the legislative policy or principle has been 
enunciated with sufficient accuracy and clarity, the preamble itself 
would satisfy the requirements of the relevant tests. 
 
(f) In every case, it would be necessary to consider the relevant provisions 
of the Act in relation to the delegation made and the question as to 
whether the delegation made is intra vires or not will have to be decided 
by the application of the relevant tests. 
 (g) Delegated legislation may take different forms, viz. conditional 
legislation, supplementary legislation subordinate legislation etc., but 
each form is subject to the one and same rule that delegation made 
without indicating intelligible limits of authority is constitutionally 
incompetent. 
 
LESSON ROUND-UP 
 
 
The Constitution of India came into force on January 26, 1950. The preamble to 
the Constitution sets out the aims and aspirations of the people of India. 
Constitution of India is basically federal but with certain unitary features. The 
essential features of a Federal Polity or System are – dual Government, 
distribution of powers, supremacy of the Constitution, independence of Judiciary, 
written Constitution, and a rigid procedure for the amendment of the Constitution. 
 
The fundamental rights are envisaged in Part III of the Constitution. These are: 
(i) Right to Equality; (ii) Right to Freedom; (iii) Right against Exploitation; 
(iv) Right to Freedom of Religion; (v) Cultural and Educational Rights; (vi) Right to 
Constitutional Remedies. 
 
The Directive Principles as envisaged by the Constitution makers lay down the 
ideals to be observed by every Government to bring about an economic 
democracy in this country. 
 
Article 51A imposing the fundamental duties on every citizen of India was 
inserted by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976. The objective 
in introducing these duties is not laid down in the Bill except that since the duties 
of the citizens are not specified in the Constitution, so it was thought necessary to 
introduce them. 
 
The most important legislative power conferred on the President is to promulgate 
Ordinances. The ambit of this Ordinance-making power of the President is co-
extensive with the legislative powers of the Parliament. The Governor‘s power to 
EP-GCL-1

make Ordinances is similar to the Ordinance making power of the President and 
has the force of an Act of the State Legislature. 
 
The Union of India is composed of 28 States and both the Union and the States 
derive their authority from the Constitution which divides all powers-legislative, 
executive and financial, between them. Both the Union and States are equally 
subject to the limitations imposed by the Constitution. However, there are some 
parts of Indian territory which are not covered by these States and such territories 
are called Union Territories. 
 
The courts in the Indian legal system, broadly speaking, consist of (i) the 
Supreme Court, (ii) the High Courts, and (iii) the subordinate courts. The 
Supreme Court, which is the highest Court in the country is an institution created 
by the Constitution. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is vast including the 
writ jurisdiction for enforcing Fundamental Rights. 
 
The increasing complexity of modern administration and the need for flexibility 
capable of rapid readjustment to meet changing circumstances, have made it 
necessary for the legislatures to delegate its powers. 
 
While delegating the powers to an outside authority, the legislature must act 
within the ambit of the powers defined by the Constitution and subject to the 
limitations prescribed thereby.

INTERPRETATION OF STATUTES 
 
 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
The complexity of modern legislation demands a clear understanding of the principles 
of construction applicable to it. The students will understand the general principles of 
interpretation as well as internal and external aids in interpretation of the statutes. 
At the end of the Study Lesson you should be able to understand: 
 
Need for and Object of Interpretation 
 
General Principles of Interpretation 
 
Internal and External Aids in Interpretation.  
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
A statute has been defined as “the will of the legislature” (Maxwell, Interpretation 
of Statutes, 11th ed. p. 1). Normally, it denotes the Act enacted by the legislature. 
A statute is thus a written “will” of the legislature expressed according to the form 
necessary to constitute it as a law of the state, and rendered authentic by certain 
prescribed forms and solemnities. (Crawford, p. 1) 
According to Bouvier‟s Law Dictionary, a statute is “a law established by the act 
of the legislative power i.e. an Act of the legislature. The written will of the legislature. 
Among the civilians, the term „statute‟ is generally applied to laws and regulations of 
every sort law which ordains, permits or prohibits anything which is designated as a 
statute, without considering from what source it arises”. 
The Constitution of India does not use the term „statute‟ but it employs the term 
“law” to describe an exercise of legislative power.  
Statutes are commonly divided into following classes: (1) codifying, when they 
codify the unwritten law on a subject; (2) declaratory, when they do not profess to 
make  any  alteration in the existing law,  but  merely  declare  or explain what it is; 
(3) remedial, when they alter the common law,  or  the judge made (non-statutory) 
law; (4) amending, when they alter the statute law; (5) consolidating, when they 
consolidate several previous statutes relating to the same subject matter, with or 
without alternations of substance; (6) enabling, when they remove a restriction or 
disability; (7) disabling or restraining, when they restrain the alienation of property; (8) 
penal, when they impose a penalty or forfeiture.

2. NEED FOR AND OBJECT OF INTERPRETATION 
The following observation of Denning L.J. in Seaford Court Estates Ltd. v. Asher, 
(1949) 2 K.B. 481 (498), on the need for statutory interpretation is instructive: “It 
is not within human powers to forsee the manifold sets of facts which may arise; 
and that; even if it were, it is not possible to provide for them in terms free from 
all ambiguity. The English language is not an instrument of mathematical 
precision. Our literature would be much the poorer if it were. This is where the 
draftsmen of Acts of Parliament have often been unfairly criticised. A judge, 
believing himself to be fettered by the supposed rule that he 
must look to the language and nothing else, laments that the 
draftsmen have not provided for this or that, or have been 
guilty of some or other ambiguity. It would certainly save the 
judge‟s trouble if Acts of Parliament were drafted with divine 
prescience and perfect clarity. In the absence of it, when a 
defect appears, a judge cannot simply fold his hands and 
blame the draftsman. He must set to work on the constructive task of finding the 
intention of Parliament, and he must do this, not only from the language of the 
statute, but also from a consideration of the social conditions which gave rise to 
it, and of the mischief which it was passed to remedy, and then he must 
supplement the written word so as to give „force and life‟ to the intention of the 
legislature. To put into other words : A judge should ask himself the question : If 
the makers of the Act had themselves come across this luck in the texture of it, 
how would they have straight ended it out? He must then do as they would have 
done. A judge must not alter the material of which it is woven, but he can and 
should iron out the creases. 
The object of interpretation has been explained in Halsbury‟s Laws of England 
3rd Ed., vol. 2, p. 381 in the following words : “The object of all interpretation of a 
„Written Document‟ is to discover the intention of the author, the written declaration of 
whose mind the document is always considered to be. Consequently, the 
construction must be as clear to the minds and apparent intention of the parties as 
possible, and as the law will permit. The function of the court is to ascertain what the 
parties meant by the words which they have used; to declare the meaning of what is 
written in the instrument, and not of what was intended to have been written; to give 
effect to the intention as expressed, the expressed meaning being, for the purpose of 
interpretation, equivalent of the intention. It is not possible to guess at the intention of 
the parties and substitute the presumed for the expressed intention. The ordinary 
rules of construction must be applied, although by doing so the real intention of the 
parties may, in some instances be defeated. Such a course tends to establish a 
greater degree of certainty in the administration of the law”. The object of 
interpretation, thus, in all cases is to see what is the intention expressed by the words 
used. The words of the statute are to be interpreted so as to ascertain the mind of the 
legislature from the natural  and  grammatical meaning of the words which it has 
used. 
According to Salmond, interpretation or construction is the process by which the 
Courts seek to ascertain the meaning of the legislature through the medium of the 
authoritative forms in which it is expressed.

3. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF INTERPRETATION 
At the outset, it must be clarified that, it is only when the intention of the 
legislature as expressed in the statute is not clear, that the Court in interpreting it will 
have any need for the rules of interpretation of statutes. It may also be pointed out 
here that since our legal system is, by and large, modelled on Common Law system, 
our rules of interpretation are also same as that of the system. It is further to be 
noted, that the so called rules of interpretation are really guidelines. 
(i) Primary Rules 
(a) The Primary Rule : Literal Construction 
According to this rule, the words, phrases and sentences of a statute 
are ordinarily to be understood in their natural, ordinary or popular 
and grammatical meaning unless such a construction leads to an 
absurdity or the content or object of the statute suggests a different 
meaning. The objectives „natural‟, „ordinary‟ and „popular‟ are used 
interchangeably.  
Interpretation should not be given which would make other provisions redundant 
(Nand Prakash Vohra v. State of H.P., AIR 2000 HP 65). 
If there is nothing to modify, alter or qualify the language which the statute 
contains, it must be construed according to the ordinary and natural meaning of the 
words. “The safer and more correct course of dealing with a question of construction 
is to take the words themselves and arrive, if possible, at their meaning without, in the 
first instance, reference to cases.” 
“Whenever you have to construe a statute or document you do not construe it 
according to the mere ordinary general meaning of the words, but according to the 
ordinary meaning of the words as applied to the subject matter with regard to which 
they are used”. (Brett M.R.) 
It is trite that construction of  a statute should be done  in a manner which would 
give effect to all its provisions [Sarbajit Rick Singh v. Union of India, (2008) 2 SCC 
417]. 
It is a corollary to the general rule of literal construction that nothing is to be 
added to or taken from a statute unless there are adequate grounds to justify the 
inference that the legislature intended something which it omitted to express. 
 
EP-GCL-2 
73
A construction which would leave without effect any part of the language of a 
statute will normally be rejected. Thus, where an Act plainly gave an appeal from one 
quarter sessions of another, it was observed that such a provision, though 
extraordinary and perhaps an oversight, could not be eliminated. 
Similarly, the main part of the section must not be construed in such a way as to 
render a proviso to the section redundant. 
Some of the other basic principles of literal construction are: 
 
(i) Every word in the law should be given meaning as no word is unnecessarily 
used. 
 (ii) One should not presume any omissions and if a word is not there in the 
Statute, it shall not be given any meaning. 
While discussing rules of literal construction the Supreme Court in State of 
H.P  v. Pawan Kumar (2005) 4 SCALE, P.1, held: 
 
— One of the basic principles of interpretation of 
statutes is to construe them according to plain, literal and 
grammatical meaning of the words. 
 
— If that is contrary to, or inconsistent with, any 
express intention or declared purpose of the Statute, or if it 
would involve any absurdity, repugnancy or inconsistency, the 
grammatical sense must then be modified, extended, abridged, so far 
as to avoid such an inconvenience, but no further.  
 
— The onus of showing that the words do not mean what they say lies 
heavily on the party who alleges it. 
He must advance something which clearly shows that the grammatical 
construction would be repugnant to the intention of the Act or lead to some 
manifest absurdity.  
(b) The Mischief Rule or Heydon‟s Rule 
In Heydon‟s Case, in 1584, it was resolved by the Barons of the Exchequer “that 
for the sure and true interpretation of all statutes in general (be they penal or 
beneficial, restrictive or enlarging of the Common Law) four things are to be 
discerned and considered: (1) What was the Common Law before the making of the 
Act; (2) What was the mischief and defect for which the Common Law did not 
provide; (3) What remedy the parliament had resolved and appointed to cure the 
disease of the Commonwealth; and (4) The true reason of the remedy. 
Although judges are unlikely to propound formally in their judgements the four 
questions in Heydon‟s Case, consideration of the “mischief” or “object” of the 
enactment is common and will often provide the solution to a problem of 
interpretation. Therefore, when the material words are capable of bearing two or 
more constructions, the most firmly established rule for construction of such words is 
the rule laid down in Heydon‟s case which has “now attained the status of a classic”. 
The rule directs that the Courts must adopt that construction which “shall suppress 
the mischief and advance the remedy”. But this does not mean that a construction 
should be adopted which ignores the plain natural meaning of the words or disregard 
EP-GCL-2 
74
the context and the collection in which they occur. (See Umed Singh v. Raj Singh, 
A.I.R. 1975 S.C. 43) 
The Supreme Court in Sodra Devi’s case, AIR 1957 S.C. 832 has expressed 
the view that the rule in Heydon‟s case is applicable only when the words in 
question are ambiguous and are reasonably capable of more than one 
meaning. 
The correct principle is that after the words have been construed in their 
context and it is found that the language is capable of bearing only one 
construction, the rule in Heydon‟s case ceases to be controlling and gives way 
to the plain meaning rule. 
(c) Rule of Reasonable Construction i.e. Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pareat 
Normally, the words used in a statute have to be construed in their ordinary 
meaning, but in many cases, judicial approach finds that the simple device of 
adopting the ordinary meaning of words, does not meet the ends as a fair and a 
reasonable construction. Exclusive reliance on the bare dictionary meaning of words‟ 
may not necessarily assist a proper construction of the statutory provision in which 
the words occur. Often enough interpreting the provision, it becomes necessary to 
have regard to the subject matter of the statute and the object which it is intended to 
achieve. 
According to this rule, the words of a statute must be construed ut res magis 
valeat quam pareat, so as to give a sensible meaning to them. A provision of law 
cannot be so interpreted as to divorce it entirely from common sense; every word or 
expression used in an Act should receive a natural and fair meaning. 
It is the duty of a Court in constructing a statute to give effect to the intention of 
the legislature. If, therefore, giving of literal meaning to a word used by the draftsman 
particularly in penal statute would defeat the object of the legislature, which is to 
suppress a mischief, the Court can depart from the dictionary meaning which will 
advance the remedy and suppress the mischief. 
It is only when the language of a statute, in its ordinary meaning 
and grammatical construction, leads to a manifest contradiction of 
the apparent purpose of the enactment, or to some inconvenience 
or absurdity, hardship of injustice, presumably not intended, a 
construction may be put upon it which modifies the meaning of the 
words and even the structure of the sentence (Tirath Singh v. 
Bachittar Singh, A.I.R. 1955 S.C. 830).  
Courts can depart from dictionary meaning of a word and give it a meaning which 
will advance the remedy and suppress the mischief provided the Court does not have 
to conjecture or surmise. A construction will be adopted in accordance with the policy 
and object of the statute (Kanwar Singh v. Delhi Administration, AIR 1965 S.C. 871). To 
make the discovered intention fit the words used in the statute, actual expression used 
in it may be modified (Newman Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. Marrables, (1931) 2 KB 297, 
Williams v. Ellis, 1880 49 L.J.M.C.). If the Court considers that the litera legis is not 
clear, it, must interpret according to the purpose, policy or spirit of the statute (ratio-
legis). It is, thus, evident that no invariable rule can be established for literal 
interpretation.

? 
In RBI v. Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Ltd. (1987) 1 SCC 424.  
the Supreme Court stated.  If a statute is looked at in the context of its enactment, 
with the glasses of the statute makers provided by such context, its scheme, the 
sections, clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear different than 
when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context.  With these 
glasses we must look at the Act as a whole and discover what each section, each 
clauses each phrase and each word is meant and designed to say as to fit into the 
scheme of the entire Act.(See also Chairman Indira Vikas Pradhikaran v. Pure 
Industrial Coke and Chemicals Ltd., AIR 2007 SC 2458). 
(d) Rule of Harmonious Construction 
A statute must be read as a whole and one provision of the Act should be 
construed with reference to other provisions in the same Act so as to make a 
consistent enactment of the whole statute. Such a construction has the merit of 
avoiding any inconsistency or repugnancy either within a section or between a 
section and other parts of the statute. It is the duty of the Courts to avoid “a head on 
clash” between two sections of the same Act and, “whenever it is possible to do so, to 
construct provisions which appear to conflict so that they harmonise” (Raj Krishna v. 
Pinod Kanungo, A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 202 at 203). 
Where in an enactment, there are two provisions which cannot be reconciled with 
each other, they should be so interpreted that, if possible, effect may be given to 
both. This is what is known as the “rule of harmonius construction”. 
The Supreme Court applied this rule in resolving a conflict between Articles 
25(2)(b) and 26(b) of the Constitution and it was held that the right of every religious 
denomination or any section thereof to manage its own affairs in matters of religion 
[Article 26(b)] is subject to a law made by a State providing for social welfare and 
reform or throwing open of Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all 
classes and sections of Hindus [Article 25(2)(b)]. See Venkataramana Devaru v. 
State of Mysore, A.I.R. 1958 S.C. 255. 
 
Test your knowledge 
State whether the following statement is “True” or “False” 
According to the Rule of Literal Construction, a statute is interpreted 
according to the general meaning of the words even if it leads to absurdity. 
Correct answer: False 
 
(e) Rule of Ejusdem Generis 
Ejusdem Generis, literally means “of the same kind or species”. The rule can be 
stated thus: 
(a) In an enumeration of different subjects in an Act, general words following 
specific words may be construed with reference to the antecedent matters, and the 
construction may be narrowed down by treating them as applying to things of the 
same kind as those previously mentioned, unless of course, there is something to 
show that a wide sense was intended; (b) If the particular words exhaust the whole 
genus, then the general words are construed as embracing a larger genus. 
In other words, the ejusdem generis rule is that, where there are general words 
EP-GCL-2 
76
following particular and specific words, the general words following particular and 
specific words must be confined to things of the same kind as those specified, unless 
there is a clear manifestation of a contrary purpose. It is merely a rule of construction 
to aid the Courts to find out the true intention of the Legislature (Jage Ram v. State of 
Haryana, A.I.R. 1971 S.C. 1033). To apply the rule the following conditions must 
exist: 
 (1) The statute contains an enumeration by specific words, 
 (2) The members of the enumeration constitute a class, 
 (3) The class is not exhausted by the enumeration, 
 (4) A general term follows the enumeration, 
 (5) There is a distinct genus which comprises more than one species, and 
 (6) There is no clearly manifested intent that the general term be given a broader 
meaning that the doctrine requires. (See Thakura Singh v. Revenue Minister, 
AIR 1965 J & K 102) 
The rule of ejusdem generis must be applied with great caution because, it 
implies a departure from the natural meaning of words, in order to give them a 
meaning or supposed intention of the legislature. The rule must be controlled by the 
fundamental rule that statutes must be construed so as to carry out the object sought 
to be accomplished. The rule requires that specific words are all of one genus, in 
which case, the general words may be presumed to be restricted to that genus. 
Whether the rule of ejusdem generis should be applied or not to a particular 
provision depends upon the purpose and object of the provision which is intended to 
be achieved. 
(ii) Other Rules of Interpretation 
(a) Expressio Unis Est Exclusio Alterius 
The rule means that express mention of one thing implies the exclusion of 
another. 
At the same time, general words in a statute must receive a general construction, 
unless there is in the statute some ground for limiting and restraining their meaning 
by reasonable construction; because many things are put into a statute ex abundanti 
cautela, and it is not to be assumed that anything not specifically included is for that 
reason alone excluded from the protection of the statute. The method of construction 
according to this maxim must be carefully watched. The failure to make the 
„expressio‟ complete may arise from accident. Similarly, the „exclusio‟ is often the 
result of inadvertence or accident because it never struck the draftsman that the thing 
supposed to be excluded requires specific mention. The maxim ought not to be 
applied when its application leads to inconsistency or injustice. 
Similarly, it cannot be applied when the language of the Statute is plain with clear 
meaning (Parbhani Transport Co-operative Society ltd v Regional Transport 
Authority, AIR 1960 SC 801) 
(b) Contemporanea Expositio Est Optima Et Fortissima in Lege 
The maxim means that the best way to give the meaning to a document or 
 
EP-GCL-2 
77
proposition of a law is to read it as it would have read when it was made. Where the 
words used in a statute have undergone alteration in meaning in course of time, the 
words will be construed to bear the same meaning as they had when the statute was 
passed on the principle expressed in the maxim. In simple words, old statutes should 
be interpreted as they would have been at the date when they were passed and prior 
usage and interpretation by those who have an interest or duty in enforcing the Act, 
and the legal profession of the time, are presumptive evidence of their meaning when 
the meaning is doubtful. 
But if the statute appears to be capable of only interpretation, the fact that a 
wrong meaning had been attached to it for many years, will be immaterial and the 
correct meaning will be given by the Courts except when title to property may be 
affected or when every day transactions have been entered into on such wrong 
interpretation. 
(c) Noscitur a Sociis 
The „Noscitur a Sociis‟  i.e. “It is known by its associates”. In other words, meaning 
of a word should be known from its accompanying or associating words. It is not a 
sound principle in interpretation of statutes, to lay emphasis on one word disjuncted 
from its preceding and succeeding words. A word in a statutory provision is to be 
read in collocation with its companion words. The pristine principle based on the 
maxim „noscitur a socitis‟ has much relevance in understanding the import of words in 
a statutory provision (K. Bhagirathi G. Shenoy v. K.P. Ballakuraya, AIR 1999 SC 
2143). 
The rule states that where two or more words which are susceptible of analogous 
meaning are coupled together, they are understood in their cognate sense. It is only 
where the intention of the legislature in associating wider words with words of 
narrower significance, is doubtful that the present rule of construction can be usefully 
applied. 
The same words bear the same meaning in the same statute. It is a matter of 
common sense that a particular word should be attributed with same meaning 
throughout a Statute. But this rule will not apply: 
 
(i) when the context excluded that principle. 
 (ii) if sufficient reason can be assigned, it is proper to construe a word in one 
part of an Act in a different sense from that which it bears in another part of 
the Act. 
 (iii) where it would cause injustice or absurdity. 
 (iv) where different circumstances are being dealt with. 
 (v) where the words are used in a different context. Many do not distinguish 
between the rule and the ejusdem generis doctrine. But there is a subtle 
distinction as pointed out in the case of State of Bombay v. Hospital Mazdoor 
Sabha, (1960) 2 SCR 866. 
(d) Strict and Liberal Construction 
In Wiberforce on Statute Law, it is said that what is meant by „strict construction‟ 
is that “Acts, are not to be regarded as including anything which is not within their 
EP-GCL-2 
78
? 
letter as well as their spirit, which is not clearly and intelligibly described in the very 
words of the statute, as well as manifestly intended”, while by „liberal construction‟ is 
meant that “everything is to be done in advancement of the remedy that can be done 
consistently with any construction of the statute”. Generally criminal laws are given 
strict interpretation and unless the accused is found guilty strictly as per the 
provisions of the law, he cannot be punished. For instance, when an Act provided for 
punishment for causing wound by cutting or stabbing and the accused caused wound 
by biting, it was not covered under that provision as cutting or stabbing implied using 
an external instrument while biting and causing wound does not involve any external 
instrument. Labour and welfare laws, on the other hand are given liberal 
interpretation as they are beneficial pieces of legislation.  Beneficial construction to 
suppress the mischief and advance the remedy is generally preferred. 
A Court invokes the rule which produces a result that satisfies its sense of justice 
in the case before it. “Although the literal rule is the one most frequently referred to in 
express terms, the Courts treat all three (viz., the literal rule, the golden rule and the 
mischief rule) as valid and refer to them as occasion demands, but do not assign any 
reasons for choosing one rather than another. Sometimes a Court discusses all the 
three approaches. Sometimes it expressly rejects the „mischief rule‟ in favour of the 
„literal rule‟. Sometimes it prefers, although never expressly, the „mischief rule‟ to the 
„literal rule‟.

4. PRESUMPTIONS 
Where the meaning of the statute is clear, there is no need for presumptions. But 
if the intention of the legislature is not clear, there are number of presumptions. 
These are : 
 (a) that the words in a statute are used precisely and not loosely. 
 (b) that vested rights, i.e., rights which a person possessed at the time the 
statute was passed, are not taken away without express words, or necessary 
implication or without compensation. 
 (c) that “mens rea”, i.e., guilty mind is required for a criminal act. There is a very 
strong presumption that a statute creating a criminal offence does not intend 
to attach liability without a guilty intent. 
 
 The general rule applicable to criminal cases is “actus non facit reum nisi 
mens sit rea" (The act itself does not constitute guilt unless done with a guilty 
intent). 
 (d) that the state is not affected by a statute unless it is expressly mentioned as 
being so affected. 
 
EP-GCL-2 
79
 (e) that a statute is not intended to be consistent with the principles of 
International Law. Although the judges cannot declare a statute void as being 
repugnant to International Law, yet if two possible alternatives present 
themselves, the judges will choose that which is not at variance with it. 
 
(f) that the legislature knows the state of the law. 
 (g) that the legislature does not make any alteration in the existing law unless by 
express enactment. 
 (h) that the legislature knows the practice of the executive and the judiciary. 
 
(i) legislature confers powers necessary to carry out duties imposed by it. 
 
(j) that the legislature does not make mistake. The Court will not even alter an 
obvious one, unless it be to correct faulty language where the intention is 
clear. 
 (jj) the law compels no man to do that which is futile or fruitless. 
 (k) legal fictions may be said to be statements or suppositions which are known, 
to be untrue, but which are not allowed to be denied in order that some 
difficulty may be overcome, and substantial justice secured. It is a well settled 
rule of interpretation that in construing the scope of a legal fiction, it would be 
proper and even necessary to assume all those facts on which alone the 
fiction can operate. 
 
(l) where powers and duties are inter-connected and it is not possible to 
separate one from the other in such a way that powers may be delegated 
while duties are retained and vice versa, the delegation of powers takes with 
it the duties. 
 (m) the doctrine of natural justice is really a doctrine for the interpretation of 
statutes, under which the Court will presume that the legislature while 
granting a drastic power must intend that it should be fairly exercised. 
5. INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL AIDS IN INTERPRETATION 
In coming to a determination as to the meaning of a particular Act, it is 
permissible to consider two points, namely, (1) the external evidence derived from 
extraneous circumstances, such as, previous legislation and decided cases etc., and 
(2) the internal evidence derived from the Act itself. 
(a) Internal Aids in Interpretation 
The following may be taken into account while interpreting a statute: 
Title 
The long title of an Act is a part of the Act and is admissible as an aid to its 
construction. The long title sets out in general terms, the purpose of the Act and it 
often precedes the preamble. It must be distinguished from short title which implies 
only an abbreviation for purposes of reference, the object of which is identification 
and not description. To give an example, The Civil Procedure Code, 1908 is a long 
title and CPC 1908 is a short title. The true nature of the law is determined not by the 
name given to it but by its substance. However, the long title is a legitimate aid to the 
construction. 
While dealing with the Supreme Court Advocates (Practice in High Court) Act, 
1951 bearing a full title as “An Act to authorise Advocates of the Supreme Court to 
EP-GCL-2 
80
practice as of right in any High Court”, S.R. Das, J. observed: “One cannot but be 
impressed at once with the wording of the full title of the Act. Although there are 
observations in earlier English Cases that the title is not a part of the statute and is, 
therefore, to be excluded from consideration in construing the statutes. It is now a 
settled law that the title of a statute is an important part of the Act and may be 
referred to for the purpose of ascertaining its general scope and of throwing light on 
its construction, although it cannot override the clear meaning of an enactment. 
Preamble 
The true place of a preamble in a statute was at one time, the subject of conflicting 
decisions. In Mills v. Wilkins, (1794) 6 Mad. 62, Lord Hold said: “the preamble of a 
statute is not part thereof, but contains generally the motives or inducement 
thereof”. On the other hand, it was said that “the preamble is to be considered, 
for it is the key to open the meaning of the makers of the Act, and the mischief it 
was intended to remedy”. The modern rule lies between these two extremes and is 
that where the enacting part is explicit and unambiguous the preamble cannot be 
resorted to, to control, qualify or restrict it, but where the enacting part is ambiguous, 
the preamble can be referred to explain and elucidate it (Raj Mal v. Harnam Singh, 
(1928) 9 Lah. 260). In Powell v. Kempton Park Race Course Co., (1899) AC 143, 157, 
Lord Halsbury said: “Two propositions are quite clear — One that a preamble may 
afford useful light as to what a statute intends to reach and another that, if an 
enactment is itself clear and unambiguous, no preamble can qualify or cut down the 
enactment”. This rule has been applied to Indian statutes also by the Privy Council in 
Secretary of State v. Maharaja Bobbili, (1920) 43 Mad. 529, and by the Courts in India 
in a number of cases (See for example, Burrakur Coal Co. v. Union of India, AIR 1961 
SC 154. Referring to the cases in Re. Kerala Education Bill, AIR 1958 SC 956 and 
Bishambar Singh v. State of Orissa, AIR 1954 SC 139, the Allahabad High Court has 
held in Kashi Prasad v. State, AIR 1967 All. 173, that even though the preamble 
cannot be used to defeat the enacting clauses of a statute, it has been treated to 
be a key for the interpretation of the statute. 
Supreme Court in Kamalpura Kochunni v. State of 
Madras, AIR 1960 SC 1080, pointed out that the preamble may 
be legitimately consulted in case any ambiguity arises in the 
construction of an Act and it may be useful to fix the meaning 
of words used so as to keep the effect of the statute within its 
real scope. 
Heading and Title of a Chapter 
In different parts of an Act, there is generally found a series or class of enactments 
applicable to some special object, and such sections are in many instances, preceded 
by a heading. It is now settled that the headings or titles prefixed to sections or group of 
sections can be referred to in construing an Act of the legislature. But conflicting 
opinions have been expressed on the question as to what weight should be attached to 
the headings. A “heading”, according to one view “is to be regarded as giving the key to 
the interpretation of clauses ranged under it, unless the wording is inconsistent with 
such interpretation; and so that headings, might be treated “as preambles to the 
provisions following them”. But according to the other view, resort to the heading can 
only be taken when the enacting words are ambiguous. So Lord Goddard, C.J. 
 
EP-GCL-2 
81
expressed himself as: However, the Court is entitled to look at the headings in an Act of 
Parliament to resolve any doubt they may have as to ambiguous words, the law is clear 
that those headings cannot be used to give a different effect to clear words in the 
sections where there cannot be any doubt as to the ordinary meaning of the words”. 
Similarly, it was said by Patanjali Shastri, J.: “Nor can the title of a chapter be 
legitimately used to restrict the plain terms of an enactment”. In this regard, the Madhya 
Pradesh High Court in Suresh Kumar v. Town Improvement Trust, AIR 1975 MP 189, 
has held: “Headings or titles prefixed to sections or group of sections may be referred 
to as to construction of doubtful expressions; but the title of a chapter cannot be used to 
restrict the plain terms of an enactment”. 
The Supreme Court observed that ..... “the headings prefixed to sections or 
entries (of a Tariff Schedule) cannot control the plain words of the provision; they 
cannot also be referred to for the purpose of construing the provision when the words 
used in the provision are clear and unambiguous; nor can they be used for cutting 
down the plain meaning of the words in the provision. Only in the case of ambiguity or 
doubt the heading or the sub-heading may be referred to as an aid for construing the 
provision but even in such a case aid could not be used for cutting down the wide 
application of the clear words used in the provision” (Frick India Ltd. v. Union of India, 
AIR 1990 SC 689). 
Marginal Notes 
In England, the disposition of the Court is to disregard the marginal notes. In our 
country the Courts have entertained different views. Although opinion is not uniform, 
the weight of authority is in favour of the view that the marginal note appended to a 
section cannot be used for construing the section. 
“There seems to be no reason for giving the marginal notes in an Indian statute 
any greater authority than the marginal notes in an English Act of Parliament” (Balraj 
Kumar v. Jagatpal Singh, 26 All. 393). Patanjali Shastri, J., after referring to the 
above case with approval observed : “Marginal notes in an Indian statute, as in an 
Act of Parliament cannot be referred to for the purpose of construing the Statute” 
(C.I.T. v. Anand Bhai Umar Bhai, A.I.R. 1950 S.C. 134). At any rate, there can be no 
justification for restricting the section by the marginal note, and the marginal note 
cannot certainly control the meaning of the body of the section if the language 
employed therein is clear and unambiguous (Chandraji Rao v. Income-tax 
Commissioner, A.I.R. 1970 S.C. 158). 
The Privy Council in Balraj Kumar v. Jagatpal Singh, 
(1904) 26 All. 393, has held that the marginal notes to the 
sections are not to be referred to for the purpose of 
construction. The Supreme Court in Western India Theatres 
Ltd. v. Municipal Corporation of Poona, (1959) S.C.J. 390, has 
also held, that a marginal note cannot be invoked for 
construction where the meaning is clear. 
Marginal notes appended to the Articles of the Constitution have been held to 
constitute part of the Constitution as passed by the Constituent Assembly and 
therefore, they have been made use of in consulting the Articles, e.g. Article 286, as 
furnishing prima facie, “some clue as to the meaning and purpose of the Article”. 
EP-GCL-2 
82
When reference to marginal note is relevant?  The Supreme Court has held that 
the marginal note although may not be relevant for rendition of decisions in all types 
of cases but where the main provision is sought to be interpreted differently, 
reference to marginal note would be permissible in law. [Sarbajit Rick Singh v. Union 
of India (2008) 2 SCC 417;  See also Dewan Singh v. Rajendra Prasad (2007) 1 
Scale 32]. 
Interpretation Clauses 
It is common to find in statutes “definitions” of certain words and expressions 
used elsewhere in the body of the statute. The object of such a definition is to avoid 
the necessity of frequent repetitions in describing all the subject-matter to which the 
word or expression so defined is intended to apply. A definition section may borrow 
definitions from an earlier Act and definitions so borrowed need not be found in the 
definition section but in some provisions of the earlier Act. 
The definition of a word in the definition section may either be restrictive of its 
ordinary meaning or it may be extensive of the same. When a word is defined to 
„mean‟ such and such, the definition is prima facie restrictive and exhaustive, 
whereas where the word defined is declared to „include‟ such and such, the definition 
is prima facie extensive. Further, a definition may be in the form of „means and 
includes‟, where again the definiton is exhaustive. On the other hand, if a word is 
defined „to apply to and include‟, the definition is understood as extensive. (See 
Balkrishan v. M. Bhai AIR 1999 MP 86) 
A definition section may also be worded in the form „so deemed to include‟ which 
again is an inclusive or extensive definition and such a form is used to bring in by a 
legal fiction something within the word defined which according to ordinary meaning 
is not included within it. 
A definition may be both inclusive and exclusive i.e. it may include certain things 
and exclude others. In such a case limited exclusion of a thing may suggest that 
other categories of that thing which are not excluded fall within the inclusive 
definition. 
The definition section may itself be ambiguous and may have to be interpreted in 
the light of the other provisions of the Act and having regard to the ordinary 
connotation of the word defined. A definition is not to be read in isolation. It must be 
read in the context of the phrase which it defines, realising that the function of a 
definition is to give precision and certainty to a word or a phrase which would 
otherwise be vague and uncertain but not to contradict or supplement it altogether. 
When a word has been defined in the interpretation clause, prima facie that 
definition governs whenever that word is used in the body of the statute. 
When a word is defined to bear a number of inclusive meanings, the sense in 
which the word is used in a particular provision must be ascertained from the context 
of the scheme of the Act, the language, the provision and the object intended to be 
served thereby. 
Proviso 
“When one finds a proviso to a section the natural presumption is that, but for the 
proviso, the enacting part of the section would have included the subject-matter of 
proviso”. In the words of Lord Macmillan: “The proper function of a proviso is to 
 
EP-GCL-2 
83
? 
except and to deal with a case which would otherwise fall within the general language 
of the main enactment, and its effect is confined to the case”. 
As stated by Hidayatullah, J. : “As a general rule, a proviso is added to an 
enactment to qualify or create an exception to what is in the enactment, and 
ordinarily, a proviso is not interpreted as stating a general rule”. 
A distinction is said to exist between the provisions worded as „proviso‟, 
„exception‟ or „saving clause‟. „Exception‟ is intended to restrain the enacting clause 
to particular cases; „proviso‟ is used to remove special cases from the general 
enactment and provide for them specially; and „saving clause‟ is used to preserve 
from destruction certain rights, remedies or privileges already existing.

Correct answer: d 
 
Illustrations or Explanation 
“Illustrations attached to sections are part of the statute and they are useful 
so far as they help to furnish same indication of the presumable intention of 
the legislature. An explanation is at times appended to a section to explain the 
meaning of words contained in the section. It becomes a part and parcel of the 
enactment. But illustrations cannot have the effect of modifying the language of the 
section and they cannot either curtail or expand the ambit of the section which alone 
forms the enactment. The meaning to be given to an „explanation‟ must depend upon 
its terms, and „no theory of its purpose can be entertained unless it is to be inferred 
from the language used” (Lalla Ballanmal v. Ahmad Shah, 1918 P.C. 249). 
An explanation, normally, should be so read as to harmonise with and clear up 
any ambiguity in the main section and should not be so construed as to widen the 
ambit of the section. It is also possible that an explanation may have been added ex 
abundanti cautela to allay groundless apprehension. 
Schedules 
The schedules form a part of the statute and must be read together with it for all 
purposes of construction. But expression in the schedule cannot control or prevail 
against the express enactment (Allen v. Flicker, 1989, 10 A and F 6.40). 
In Ramchand Textile v. Sales Tax Officer, A.I.R. 1961, All. 24, the Allahabad 
High Court has held that, if there is any appearance of inconsistency between 
the schedule and the enactment, the enactment shall prevail. If the enacting 
part and the schedule cannot be made to correspond, the latter must yield to 
the former. 
EP-GCL-2 
84
There are two principles or rules of interpretation which ought to be applied to the 
combination of an Act and its schedule. If the Act says that the schedule is to be used 
for a certain purpose and the heading of the part of the schedule in question shows 
that it is prima facie at any rate devoted to that purpose, then the Act and the 
schedule must be read as if the schedule were operating for that purpose only. If the 
language of a clause in the schedule can be satisfied without extending it beyond for 
a certain purpose, in spite of that, if the language of the schedule has in its words and 
terms that go clearly outside the purpose, the effect must be given by them and they 
must not be treated as limited by the heading of the part of the schedule or by the 
purpose mentioned in the Act for which the schedule is prima facie to be used. One 
cannot refuse to give effect to clear words simply because prima facie they seem to 
be limited by the heading of the schedule and the definition of the purpose of the 
schedule contained in the Act. 
Whether a particular requirement prescribed by a form is mandatory or directory 
may have to be decided in each case having regard to the purpose or object of the 
requirement and its interrelation with other enacting provisions of the statute; and it is 
difficult to lay down any uniform rule. Where forms prescribed under the rules 
become part of rules and, the Act confers an authority prescribed by rules to frame 
particulars of an application form, such authority may exercise the power to prescribe 
a particular form of application. 
The statement of objects and reasons as well as the „notes on clauses of the Bill 
relating to any particular legislation may be relied upon for construing any of its 
provisions where the clauses have been adopted by the Parliament without any 
change in enacting the Bill, but where there have been extensive changes during the 
passage of the Bill in Parliament, the objects and reasons of the changed provisions 
may or may not be the same as of the clauses of the original Bill and it will be unsafe 
to attach undue importance to the statement of objects and reasons or notes on 
clauses. 
The Courts have only to enquire, what has the legislature thought fit to enact? 
Regarding the reference to the statement of objects and reasons, it is a settled 
law that it can legitimately be referred to for a correct appreciation of: 
 (1) what was the law before the disputed Act was passed; 
 (2) what was the mischief or defect for which the law had not provided; 
 (3) what remedy the legislature has intended; and 
 (4) the reasons for the statute. 
(b) External Aids in Interpretation 
Apart from the intrinsic aids, such as preamble and purview of the Act, the Court 
can consider resources outside the Act, called the extrinsic aids, in interpreting and 
finding out the purposes of the Act. Where the words of an Act are clear and 
unambiguous, no resource to extrinsic matter, even if it consists of the sources of the 
codification, is permissible. But where it is not so, the Court can consider, apart from 
the intrinsic aids, such as preamble and the purview of the Act, both with the prior 
events leading up to the introduction of the Bill, out of the which the Act has emerged, 
and subsequent events from the time of its introduction until its final enactment like 
the legislation, history of the Bill, Select Committee reports. 
 
EP-GCL-2 
85
Parliamentary History 
The Supreme Court, enunciated the rule of exclusion of Parliamentary history in 
the way it is enunciated by English Courts, but on many occasions, the Court used 
this aid in resolving questions of construction. The Court has now veered to the view 
that legislative history within circumspect limits may be consulted by Courts in 
resolving ambiguities. 
It has already been noticed that the Court is entitled to take into account “such 
external or historical facts as may be necessary to understand the subject-matter of 
the statute”, or to have regard to “the surrounding circumstances” which existed at 
the time of passing of the statute. Like any other external aid, the inferences from 
historical facts and surrounding circumstances must give way to the clear language 
employed in the enactment itself. 
Reference to Reports of Committees 
The report of a Select Committee or other Committee on whose report an 
enactment is based, can be looked into “so as to see the background against which 
the legislation was enacted, the fact cannot be ignored that Parliament may, and 
often does, decide to do something different to cure the mischief. So we should not 
be unduly influenced by the Report (Letang v. Cooper (1964) 2 All. E.R. 929; see also 
Assam Railways & Trading Co. Ltd. v. I.R.C. (1935) A.C. 445). 
When Parliament has enacted a statute as recommended by the Report of a 
Committee and there is ambiguity or uncertainty in any provision of the statute, the 
Court may have regard to the report of the Committee for ascertaining the intention 
behind the provision (Davis v. Johnson (1978) 1 All. E.R. 1132. But where the words 
used are plain and clear, no intention other than what the words convey can be 
imported in order to avoid anomalies. 
Present trends in the European Economic Community Countries and the 
European Court, however, is to interpret treaties, conventions, statutes, etc. by 
reference to travaux preparatories, that is, all preparatory records such as reports 
and other historical material. 
Social, Political and Economic Developments and Scientific Invention 
Reference to other Statutes 
It has already been stated that a statute must be read as a whole as words are to 
be understood in their context. Extension of this rule of context, permits reference to 
other statutes in pari materia, i.e. statutes dealing with the same subject matter or 
forming part of the same system. Viscount Simonds conceived it to be a right and 
duty to construe every word of a statute in its context and he used the word in its 
widest sense including other statutes in pari materia. 
The meaning of the phrase „pari materia‟ has been explained in an American 
case in the following words: “Statutes are in pari materia which relate to the same 
person or thing, or to the same class of persons or things. The word par must not be 
confounded with the words simlis. It is used in opposition to it intimating not likeness 
merely, but identity. It is a phrase applicable to public statutes or general laws made 
at different times and in reference to the same subject. When the two pieces of 
legislation are of differing scopes, it cannot be said that they are in pari materia. 
It is a well accepted legislative practice to incorporate by reference, if the 
legislature so chooses, the provisions of some other Act in so far as they are relevant 
EP-GCL-2 
86
? 
for the purposes of and in furtherance of the scheme and subjects of the Act. 
Words in a later enactment cannot ordinarily be construed with reference to the 
meaning given to those or similar words in an earlier statute. But the later law is 
entitled to weight when it comes to the problem of construction. 
Generally speaking, a subsequent Act of a legislature affords no useful guide to 
the meaning of another Act which comes into existence before the later one was ever 
framed. Under special circumstances the law does, however, admit of a subsequent 
Act to be resorted to for this purpose but the conditions, under which the later Act 
may be resorted to for the interpretation of the earlier Act are strict. Both must be 
laws on the same subject and the part of the earlier Act which is sought to be 
construed must be ambiguous and capable of different meanings. 
Although a repealed statute has to be considered, as if it had never existed, this 
does not prevent the Court from looking at the repealed Act in pari materia on a 
question of construction. 
The regulations themselves cannot alter or vary the meaning of the words of a 
statute, but they may be looked at as being an interpretation placed by the 
appropriate Governent department on the words of the statute. Though the 
regulations cannot control construction of the Act, yet they may be looked at, to assist 
in the interpretation of the Act and may be referred to as working out in detail the 
provisions of the Act consistently with their terms. 
Dictionaries 
When a word is not defined in the Act itself, it is permissible to refer to 
dictionaries to find out the general sense in which that word is understood in common 
parlance. However, in selecting one out of the various meanings of the word, regard 
must always be had to the context as it is a fundamental rule that “the meaning of 
words and expressions used in an Act must take their colour from the context in 
which they appear”. Therefore, when the context makes the meaning of a word quite 
clear, it becomes unnecessary to search for and select a particular meaning out of 
the diverse meanings a word is capable of, according to lexicographers”. As stated by 
Krishna Aiyar, J. “Dictionaries are not dictators of statutory construction where the 
benignant mood of a law, and more emphatically the definition clause furnish a 
different denotation”. Further, words and expressions at times have a „technical‟ or a 
„legal meaning‟ and in that case, they are understood in that sense. Again, judicial 
decisions expounding the meaning of words in construing statutes in pari materia will 
have more weight than the meaning furnished by dictionaries. 
Use of Foreign Decisions 
Use of foreign decisions of countries following the same system of jurisprudence 
as ours and rendered on statutes in pari materia has been permitted by practice in 
Indian Courts. The assistance of such decisions is subject to the qualification that 
prime importance is always to be given to the language of the relevant Indian Statute, 
the circumstances and the setting in which it is enacted and the Indian conditions 
where it is to be applied.

LESSON ROUND-UP 
 
 
A statute normally denotes the Act enacted by the legislature. The object of 
interpretation in all cases is to see what is the intention expressed by the words 
used. The words of the statute are to be interpreted so as to ascertain the mind of 
the legislature from the natural and grammatical meaning of the words which it 
has used. 
 
The General Principles of Interpretation are Primary Rules and other Rules of 
Interpretation. 
 
The primary rules are: 
 
Literal Construction: According to this rule, the words, phrases and 
sentences of a statute are ordinarily to be understood in their natural, 
ordinary or popular and grammatical meaning unless such a construction 
leads to an absurdity or the content or object of the statute suggests a 
different meaning. 
 
The Mischief Rule or Heydon‟s Rule: The rule directs that the Courts must adopt 
that construction which “shall suppress the mischief and advance the remedy”. 
 
Rule of Reasonable Construction i.e. Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pareat: 
According to this rule, the words of a statute must be construed ut res magis 
valeat quam pareat, so as to give a sensible meaning to them. A provision of law 
cannot be so interpreted as to divorce it entirely from common sense; every word 
or expression used in an Act should receive a natural and fair meaning. 
 
Rule of Harmonious Construction: Where in an enactment, there are two 
provisions which cannot be reconciled with each other, they should be so 
interpreted that, if possible, effect may be given to both. 
 
Rule of Ejusdem Generis: The ejusdem generis rule is that, where there are 
general words following particular and specific words, the general words 
following particular and specific words must be confined to things of the 
same kind as those specified, unless there is a clear manifestation of a 
contrary purpose. 
 
Other Rules of Interpretation are: 
 
Expressio Unis Est Exclusio Alterius: The rule means that express mention 
of one thing implies the exclusion of another. 
 
Contemporanea Expositio Est Optima Et Fortissima in Lege: The maxim 
means that a contemporaneous exposition is the best and strongest in law. 
 
The „Noscitur a Sociis‟ i.e. “It is known by its associates”. In other words, 
meaning of a word should be known from its accompanying or associating 
words. 
EP-GCL-2 
88
 
Strict and Liberal Construction: What is meant by „strict construction‟ is that 
“Acts, are not to be regarded as including anything which is not within their 
letter as well as their spirit, which is not clearly and intelligibly described in 
the very words of the statute, as well as manifestly intended”, while by „liberal 
construction‟ is meant that “everything is to be done in advancement of the 
remedy that can be done consistently with any construction of the statute”. 
 
Presumptions: Where the meaning of the statute is clear, there is no need for 
presumptions. But if the intention of the legislature is not clear, there are 
number of presumptions. 
 
Internal and External Aids in Interpretation. 
 
Internal Aids in Interpretation: The following may be taken into account while 
interpreting a statute: 
 
Title; Preamble; Heading and Title of a Chapter; Marginal Notes; 
Interpretation Clauses; Proviso; Illustrations or Explanations; and Schedules. 
 
External Aids in Interpretation: Apart from the intrinsic aids, such as preamble 
and purview of the Act, the Court can consider resources outside the Act, 
called the extrinsic aids, in interpreting and finding out the purposes of the Act. 
There are: Parliamentary History; Reference to Reports of Committees; 
Reference to other Statutes; Dictionaries and Use of Foreign Decisions.

STUDY III 
LAW RELATING TO SPECIFIC RELIEF, ARBITRATION AND 
CONCILIATION, TORTS, LIMITATION AND EVIDENCE 
  
 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
The object of this study lesson is to impart basic knowledge to the students regarding 
law relating to Specific Relief, Arbitration and Conciliation, Torts, Limitation and 
Evidence. 
At the end of this Study Lesson, you should be able to understand the basic legal 
frame work envisaged under the 
 
Specific Relief Act 
 
Arbitration and Conciliation Act 
 
Limitation Act 
 
Evidence Act and the   
 
Remedies available to a person under the law of torts.   
 
I  LAW RELATING TO SPECIFIC RELIEF 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The law relating to specific relief in India is provided in the Specific Relief Act of 
1963. The Specific Relief Act, 1963 was enacted to define and amend the law 
relating to certain kinds of specific relief. 
The expression ‗specific relief‘ means a relief in specie. It is a remedy which aims 
at the exact fulfillment of an obligation. 
2. SCOPE OF THE ACT 
The Specific Relief Act, 1963 is not exhaustive. It does not consolidate the whole 
law on the subject. As the Preamble would indicate, it is an Act ‖to define and amend 
the law relating to certain kinds of specific relief‖. It does not purport to lay down the 
law relating to specific relief in all its ramifications (AIR 1972 SC 1826) 
There are other kinds of specific remedy provided for by other enactments e.g. 
the Transfer of Property Act deals with the specific remedies available to a mortgagor 
or mortgagee; the Partnership Act deals with the specific remedies like dissolution 
and accounts as between partners.

Under the Specific Relief Act, 1963, remedies have been divided as specific relief 
(Sections 5-35) and preventive relief (Sections 36-42). These are : 
 
(i) Recovering possession of property (Sections 5-8); 
 
(ii) Specific performance of contracts (Sections 9-25); 
 
(iii) Rectification of Instruments (Section 26); 
 
(iv) Rescission of contracts (Sections 27-30); 
 
(v) Cancellation of Instruments (Section 31-33); 
 
(vi) Declaratory decrees (Sections 34-35); and 
 (vii) Injunctions (Sections 36-42). 
3. WHO MAY SUE FOR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE 
Section 15 lays down that specific performance of a contract may be obtained by 
(a) any party thereto; (b) the representative in interest or the principal, of any party 
thereto; provided that where the learning, skill, insolvency or any personal quality of 
such party is a material ingredient in the contract, or where the contract provides that 
his interest shall not be assigned, his representative in interest or his principal shall 
not be entitled to specific performance of the contract, unless such party has already 
performed his part of the contract, or the performance thereof by his representative in 
interest, or his principal, has been accepted by the other party; (c) where the contract 
is a settlement on marriage, or a compromise of doubtful rights between members of 
the same family, any person beneficially entitled thereunder; (d) where the contract 
has been entered into by tenant-for-life in due exercise of a power the remainder 
man; (e) a reversioner in possession, where the agreement is a convenant entered 
into with his predecessor in title and the reversioner is entitled to the benefit of such 
convenant; (f) a reversioner in remainder, where the agreement is such a covenant, 
and the reversioner is entitled to the benefit thereof and will sustain material injury by 
reason of its breach; (g) when a company has entered into a contract and 
subsequently becomes amalgamated with another company the new company which 
arises out of the amalgamation; (h) when the promoters of a company have, before 
its incorporation, entered into a contract for the purpose of the company and such a 
contract is warranted by the terms of the incorporation of the company provided that 
the company has accepted the contract and has communicated such acceptance to 
the other party to the contract. 
Generally, only a party to the contract can get its specific performance. The 
section gives the list of persons who can sue for specific performance of a contract. 
The general principle is that in a suit for specific performance of a contract, all the 
parties to the contract should be parties to the suit and no one else.

Contracts which can be specifically enforced 
Section 10 provides the cases in which specific performance of contract is 
enforceable. It says that except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, the specific 
performance of any contract may, in the discretion of the Court, be enforced (a) when 
there exists no standard for ascertaining the actual damage caused by the non-
performance of the act agreed to be done, or (b) when the act agreed to be done is 
such that compensation in money for its non-performance would not afford adequate 
relief. The explanation provides that unless and until the contrary is proved, the Court 
shall presume: 
(i) that the breach of a contract to transfer immovable property cannot be 
adequately relieved by compensation in money, and (ii) that the breach of a contract 
to transfer movable property can be so relieved except in the two cases: (a) where 
the property is not an ordinary article of commerce or is of special value or interest to 
the plaintiff, or consists of goods which are not easily obtainable in the market, and 
(b) where the property is held by the defendant as the agent or trustee of the plaintiff. 
So, under this Section, contracts for sale of patent right, copy right, shares of a 
company which are not easily available, future property, chattels of special value, 
etc., are specifically enforceable. In an agreement for sale of agricultural land, the 
respondent vendor wilfully avoided the execution of sale deed after receiving full sale 
consideration. Rajasthan High Court held that compensation by way of damages 
would not be substituted to execution of sale deed. The Court directed the 
respondents to enforce the specific performance of the agreement (Ram Karan and 
others v. Govind Lal and other, AIR 1999 Raj. 167). In a suit for specific performance 
of contract of sale of a house, a stranger to the contract cannot seek to be impleaded. 
That will change the very nature of the suit. 
To succeed in a suit for specific performance, the plaintiff has to prove: (a) that a 
valid agreement of sale was entered into by the defendant in his favour and the terms 
thereof; (b) that the defendant committed breach of the contract; and (c) that he was 
always ready and willing to perform his part of the obligations in terms of the contract 
Mankaur v. Hartar Singh (2010) 10 SCC 512. 
Cases in which specific performance of contracts connected with trusts enforceable 
Section 11 lays down that except as otherwise provided in this Act, specific 
performance of a contract may, in the discretion of the Court, be enforced when the 
act agreed to be done is in the performance wholly or partly of a trust. But if a trustee 
enters into a contract in excess of his powers then such a contract cannot be 
specifically enforced. 
Illustrations 
A contracts with B to paint a picture for B and B agrees to pay Rs. 1000 for the 
same. The picture is painted. ‗B‘ is entitled to have it delivered to him on payment or 
tender of Rs. 1,000. 
A is a trustee of land with power of lease it for 7 years. He enters into a contract 
with B to grant a lease of the land for 7 years, with a covenant to renew the lease at 
the expiry of the term. This contract cannot be specifically enforced.

The directors of company have power to sell the concern with the sanction of a 
general meeting of the shareholders, Directors contract to sell it without any such 
sanction. This contract cannot be specifically enforced. 
Specific performance of part of a contract 
Section 12 deals with specific performance of a part of a contract. Sub-section (1) 
lays down the general principle that except as otherwise hereinafter provided in this 
section, the Court shall not direct the specific performance of a part of a contract. 
Sub-sections (2)-(4) lay down the exceptions to this general rule as follows: 
(i) Sub-section 2 says that where a party to a contract is unable to perform the 
whole of his part of it, but the part which must be left unperformed bears only a small 
proportion to the whole in value and admits of compensation in money, the Court 
may, at the suit of the either party, direct the specific performance of so much of the 
contract as can be performed and award compensation in money for the deficiency. 
A contracts to sell B a piece of land consisting of 100 bighas. It turns out that 98 
bighas of the land belongs to A and the two remaining bighas to a stranger, who 
refuses to part with them. The two bighas are not necessary for the use of enjoyment 
of the 98 bighas, nor so important for such use or enjoyment that the loss of them 
may not be made in goods or in money. A may be directed at the suit of B to convey 
to B the 98 bighas and to make compensation to him. For not conveying the two 
remaining bighas; B may be directed at the suit of A, to pay to A, on receiving the 
conveyance and possession of the land, the stipulated purchase money less the sum 
awarded as compensation for the deficiency. 
(ii) Sub-section 3 lays down that where a party to a contract is unable to perform 
the whole of his part of it, and the part which must be left unperformed either (a) 
forms a considerable part of the whole, though admitting of compensation in money; 
or (b) does not admit of compensation in money; he is not entitled to obtain a decree 
for specific performance; but the Court may, at the suit of the other party, direct the 
party in default to perform specifically so much of his part of the contract as he can 
perform, if the party (i) in a case falling under clause (a), pays or has paid the agreed 
consideration for the whole of the contract reduced by the consideration for the part 
which must be left unperformed and in a case falling under clause (b), pays or has 
paid the consideration for the whole of the contract without any abatement, and (ii) in 
either case, relinquishes all claims to the performance of the remaining part of the 
contract and all rights to compensation, either for the deficiency or for the loss or 
damage sustained by him through the default of the defendant. 
For example, A contracts to sell B a piece of land consisting of 100 bighas for  
Rs. 1,00,000. It turns out that only 50 bighas of land belong to A. 50 bighas are 
substantial part of the contract. A cannot demand specific performance of the 
contract but B can demand specific performance to get 50 bighas of land from A by 
paying the full consideration i.e. Rs. 1,00,000. 
(iii) Sub-section 4 lays down that when a part of a contract which taken by itself, 
can and ought to be specifically performed, stands on a separate and independent 
footing from another part of the same contract which cannot or ought not to be 
specifically performed, the Court may direct specific performance of the former part. 
For the purposes of this section, a party to the contract shall be deemed to be unable 
EP-GCL-3 
94
? 
to perform the whole of his part of it, if a portion of its subject matter existing at the 
date of the contract has ceased to exist at the time of its performance. 
Section 13 lays down the rights of a purchaser or lessee against the seller or 
lessor with no title or imperfect title. It lays down that where a person contracts to sell 
or let certain immovable property having no title or only an imperfect title, the 
purchaser or lessee (subject to the other provisions of this Chapter) has the following 
rights, namely: (a) if the vendor or lessor has, subsequent to the contract, acquired 
any interest in the property, the purchaser or lessee may compel him to make good 
the contract out of such interest; (b) where the concurrence of other persons is 
necessary for validating the title, and they are bound to convey at the request of the 
vendor or lessor, the purchaser or lessee may compel him to procure such 
concurrence and when conveyance by other person is necessary to validate the title 
and they are bound to convey at the request of the vendor or lessor, the purchaser or 
lessee may compel him to procure such conveyance; (c) where the vendor professes 
to sell unencumbered property but the property is, mortgaged for an amount not 
exceeding the purchase money and the vendor has in fact only a right to redeem it, 
the purchaser may compel him to redeem the mortgage and to obtain a valid 
discharge, and, where necessary, also a conveyance from the mortgagee; (d) where 
the vendor or lessor sues for specific performance of the contract and the suit is 
dismissed on the ground of his want of title, or imperfect title, the defendant has a 
right to a return of his deposit, interest and costs on the interest, if any, of the vendor 
or lessor in the property which is the subject matter of the contract. Sub-section (2) of 
Section 13 lays down that the aforesaid provisions of the sections shall also supply, 
as far as may be to contracts for or hire of movable property.

Correct answer: (a), (b), and (d) 
 
Contracts which cannot be specifically enforced 
Section 14 lays down the contracts which cannot be specifically enforced. They 
are (a) A contract for the non-performance of which compensation in money is an 
adequate relief; (b) A contract which runs into such minute and numerous details that 
the Court cannot enforce specific performance of its material terms or which is 
dependant upon the personal qualification or volition of the parties or a contract from 
its nature is such that the Court cannot enforce specific performance; (c) A contract 
which is in its nature determinable; (d) A contract, the performance of which involves 
the performance of a continuous duty which the court cannot supervise. Sub-section 
(2) lays down that save as provided by the Arbitration Act, 1943, no contract to refer 
present or future difference to arbitration shall be specifically enforced; but if any 
person who has made such a contract (other than an arbitration agreement to which 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
95
the provisions for the said Act apply) and has refused to perform it, sues in respect of 
any subject which he has contracted to refer, the existence of such a contract shall 
bar the suit. 
Sub-section (3) lays down that notwithstanding anything contained in clause (a) or 
clause (c) or clause (d) of Sub-section (1), the Court may enforce specific performance 
in the following cases: (a) where the suit is for the enforcement of a contract—(i) to 
execute a mortage or furnish any other security for securing the repayment of any loan 
which the borrower is not willing to repay at once; provided that where only a part of the 
loan has been advanced the vendor is willing to advance the remaining part of the loan 
in terms of the contract; or (ii) to take up and pay for any debentures of a company; (b) 
where the suit is for (i) the execution of a formal deed of partnership, the parties having 
commenced to carry on the business, or  (ii) the purchase of a share of a partner of a 
firm (c) where the suit is for the enforcement of a contract for the construction of any 
building or the execution of any other work on land provided that the following 
conditions are fulfilled, namely, (i) the building or other work is described in the contract 
in terms sufficiently precise to enable the Court to determine the exact nature of the 
building or work; (ii) the plaintiff has a substantial interest in the performance of the 
contract and the interest is of such a nature that compensation in money for non-
performance of the contract is not an adequate relief; and (iii) the defendant has, in 
pursuance of the contract, obtained possession of the land on which the building is to 
be constructed or other work is to be executed. 
Illustrations 
A contracts to sell and B contracts to buy, one lakh of rupees in the four per cent 
Central Government loan; the contract may be specifically performed. 
A contracts to render personal service to B or A contracts to marry B or A 
contracts to employ B on personal service or A, an author, contracts with B, a 
publisher to complete a literary work. B cannot enforce specific performance of these 
contracts. Not only contract of personal service, but any contract requiring personal 
skill, knowledge or volition of the parties, for example, to marry, to paint a picture, to 
complete a literary work or to sing or act at a theatre will not be specifically enforced 
as such contracts would require a constant and general superintendence as cannot 
be conveniently undertaken by a Court of Justice. 
A and B contract to become partners, the contract is not specifying the duration 
of the proposed partnership. In such a case the contract cannot be specifically 
enforced since, either A and B might at once dissolve the partnership (Scott v. 
Rayment (1868) L.R. 7 Eq. 112). 
The Court will not decree specific performance of an agreement if it be of such a 
nature that better justice will be done by leaving the parties to their remedy in damages 
(Wilson v. Northampton & Banbury Junction Rly. Co. (1874) 9 C.H. App. 279).  
The very foundation of specific performance of a contract is 
that an award for damages does not afford the aggrieved party 
a complete remedy. If in the opinion of the Court damages will 
be an adequate remedy, specific performance of the contract 
cannot be decreed (Ramji Patel v. Rao Kishore, (1929) P.C. 190).  
EP-GCL-3 
96
In such a case pecuniary compensation is equated with the specific performance 
of the contract. It can be decreed only when the remedy at law is not adequate or is 
defective. The court may come to the conclusion that the ends of justice will be 
served better by awarding the damages instead of the specific performance of the 
contract. 
A Contract may be specifically enforced: 
 
(a) If it is one for non-performance of which the mere payment of money would 
not be an adequate relief; and 
 
(b) the contract is otherwise, proper to be specifically enforced. Section 14(1)(b) 
provides three reasons for refusing specific performance: 
 
(i) When a contract runs into minute or numerous details; or 
 
(ii) When a contract is dependent upon the personal qualification or volition 
of the parties; or 
 
(iii) When the contract by nature is such that the Court cannot enforce, 
specific performance of its material terms. 
In the same way, contracts of personal service cannot be specifically enforced. 
These contracts are based upon the personal relations of the parties. They require 
mutual trust and confidence of the parties. When the contract is for personal service, 
it requires some skill or talent or of some intellectual pursuit, and in that case a 
decree for its specific performance cannot be passed by the court, as it will never 
know if the decree has been truthfully and fully executed. The Court will refuse 
specific performance of a contract if it is of such a nature that the Court cannot 
enforce its specific performance. 
Under Section 14(1)(c) contracts which are in their nature determinable cannot 
be specifically enforced. 
The Court will not enforce a contract which is in its nature determinable by the 
defendant. Determinable contract is such a contract where one of the parties can put 
an end to it. So even if a decree is passed, the defendant by putting an end to the 
contract, will evade the decree. A and B contract to become partners in a certain 
business, the contract not specifying the duration of the proposed partnership can not 
be specifically performed, for if it were so performed, either A or B might at once 
dissolve the partnership. 
4. RECOVERY OF POSSESSION OF MOVABLE AND IMMOVABLE PROPERTY 
Sections 5 to 8 deal with recovery of possession of property. Property 
may either be (i) immovable, or (ii) movable. Sections 5 and 6 deal with 
recovery of possession of immovable property while Sections 7 and 8 
deal with movable property. 
Recovery of possession of specific immovable property 
According to Section 5, a person, entitled to the possession of specific 
immovable property may recover the same in the manner provided by the Code of 
Civil Procedure, 1908. The word ‗person‘ includes any company or association or 
body of individuals, whether incorporated or not. The action under Section 5 arises 
when claim is made on the basis of ―title‖. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
97
Recovery of possession of dispossessed immovable property 
The Act provides another relief under Section 6 for the recovery of possession of 
immovable property where the claim is based merely on ‗possession‘. Section 6 
provides that if any person is dispossessed without his consent, of immovable 
property otherwise than in due course of Law, he or any person claiming through him 
may by suit recover possession thereof, notwithstanding any other title that may be 
set up in such suit. There are two restrictions; no suit under Section 6 shall be 
brought (i) after the expiry of 6 months from the date of dispossession, or (ii) against 
the Government. Under Sub-section (3) no appeal or review is allowed of any order 
of decree passed under this Section. Sub-section (4) allows a person to file a suit to 
establish his title to such property and recover possession thereof. 
The object of these provisions is to discourage people from taking the law into 
their own hands. The Sections provide a speedy and summary remedy through a 
medium of Civil Court for restoration of possession to the dispossessed. Section 5 
thus provides for a suit for ejectment on the basis of title and Section 6 gives a 
remedy without establishing title provided the suit is brought within 6 months of the 
date of possession. The object of Section 6 is to discourage forcible dispossession 
and to enable the person dispossessed to recover possession by merely providing 
previous possession and wrongful dispossession without proving title (Lachman v. 
Shambu Narain, ILR (1911) 33 ALL 174). A suit under Section 6 is maintainable 
between landlords and tenants. Heirs are also entitled to sue for recovery of 
possession. 
Recovery of specific movable property 
A person is entitled to recover the possession of specific movable property in the 
manner provided by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. (Section 7) 
Explanation 1: A trustee may sue for possession of movable property of which he 
is a trustee. The term ‗trustee‘ includes every person holding property in trust. 
Explanation 2: A special or temporary right to the present possession of movable 
property is sufficient to support a suit under this section. 
Illustrations 
 
(a) A bequeaths land to B for his life, with remainder to C. A dies, B enters on 
the land, but C, without B‘s consent, obtains possession of the title deeds, B 
may recover them from C. 
 
(b) A pledges certain jewels to B to secure a loan. B disposes of them before he 
is entitled to do so. A, without having paid or tendered the amount of the 
loan, sues B for possession of the jewels. The suit should be dismissed, as 
A is not entitled to their possession, whatever right he may have to secure 
their safe custody (See Donald v. Suckling (1866) L.R. 1 Q.B. 585). 
 
(c) A receives a letter addressed to him by B. B gets back the letter without A‘s 
consent. A has such a property therein as entitles him to recover it from B 
(Oliver v. Oliver (1861) 11 C.B.N.S. 139).

(d) A deposits books and papers for safe custody with B. B losses them and C 
finds them, but refuses to deliver them to B when demanded. B may recover 
them from C, subject to C‘s right, if any, under Section 168 of the Indian 
Contract Act, 1872. 
 
(e) A, a warehouse-keeper, is charged with the delivery of certain goods to Z, 
which B takes out of A‘s possession. A may sue B for the goods. 
An action in detinue would lie only for some specific article of movable property 
capable of being recovered in specie and of being seized and delivered up to the 
winning party. Section 7 lays down that a person entitled to the possession of specific 
movable propety may recover the same in the manner prescribed by the Civil 
Procedure Code. A trustee or a person having a special or a temporary right to the 
present possession may also file a suit under this section.

Which of the following Sections deal with the recovery of possession of movable 
property? 
 
(a) Sections 1 and 2 
 
(b) Sections 3 and 4 
 
(c) Sections 7 and 8 
 
(d) Sections 9 and 10 
Correct answer: (c) 
 
Liability of person in possession, not as owner to deliver to persons entitled to 
immediate possession 
Section 8 lays down that any person having the possession or control of a 
particular article of movable property of which he is not the owner, may be compelled 
specifically, to deliver it to the person entitled to its immediate possession in any of 
the following four cases: 
(a) When the thing claimed is held by the defendant as the agent or trustee of the 
plaintiff, (b) when the compensation in money would not afford the plaintiff adequate 
relief for the loss of the thing claimed, (c) when it would be extremely difficult to 
ascertain the actual damage caused by its loss, (d) when the possession of the thing 
claimed has been wrongfully transferred from the plaintiff. Unless and until the 
contrary is proved, the Court shall, in respect of any article of movable property 
claimed under clause (b) or (c) of this section presume that (i) compensation in 
money would not afford the plaintiff adequate relief for the loss of the thing claimed or 
as the case may be, and (ii) it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the actual 
damage caused by its loss. 
Thus under this part of the Act, if a person, who has been dispossessed, does 
not bring a suit under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act within 6 months, he may still 
bring a suit for recovery alleging any title to the property. But in this case, the suit 
may be defeated by the defendant by proving a better title.

5. PERSONS AGAINST WHOM SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE AVAILABLE 
Section 15 lays down the parties who can bring an action for specific 
performance. 
According to Section 19, specific performance of a contract may be enforced 
against (a) either party thereto, (b) any person claiming under him, by a title arising 
subsequently to the contract except a transferee for value who has paid his money in 
good faith and without notice of the original contract, (c) any person claiming under a 
title which though prior to the contract, and known to the plaintiff, might have been 
displaced by the defendant, (d) when a company has entered into a contract and 
subsequently becomes amalgamated with another company — the new company 
which arises out of the amalgamation, (e) when the promoters of a company have 
before its incorporation entered into a contract, for the purpose of the company and 
such contract is warranted by the terms of the incorporation of the company; provided 
that the company has accepted the contract and communicated such acceptance to 
the other party to the contract. 
Clauses (a) and (b) embody the principle that Court will enforce specific 
performance of a contract not only against either party, thereto, but also against any 
person claiming under either of the parties, a title arising subsequently to the 
contract, except a transferee for value who has paid money in good faith and without 
notice of the original contract. 
Examples to clause (c) are voluntary alienness, joint tenants claiming 
survivorship and remainder man. 
6. PERSONS AGAINST WHOM SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE CANNOT BE 
ENFORCED 
Under Section 16, specific performance of a contract cannot be enforced in 
favour of a person — (a) who would not be entitled to recover compensation for its 
breach, or (b) who has became incapable of performing, or violates any essential 
term of the contract that on his part remains to be performed, or acts in fraud of the 
contract, or wilfully acts at variance with, or in subversion of, the relation intended to 
be established by the contract, or (c) who fails to aver and prove that he has 
performed or has always been ready and willing to perform the essential terms of the 
contract which are to be performed by him, other than terms the performance of 
which has been prevented or waived by the defendant. The obligation imposed by 
EP-GCL-3 
100 
Section 16 of the Act is upon the Court not to grant specific performance to a plaintiff 
who has not met the requirements of clause (a), (b) and (c) thereof. 
Thus in a suit for specific performance the plaintiff should not only plead and 
prove the terms of the agreement but should also plead and prove his readiness and 
willingness to perform his obligations under the contract in terms of the contract. 
To adjudge whether the plaintiff is ready and willing to perform his part of the 
contract, the court must take into consideration the conduct of the plaintiff prior and 
subsequent to the filing of the suit along with other attending circumstances. Right 
from the date of the execution till the date of the decree he must prove that he is 
ready and has always been willing to perform his part of the contract. N.P. 
Thirgnanam v. Dr. R Jagan Mohan Rao, AIR 1996 SC 116, (1995) 5 SCC 115. 
The continuous readiness and willingness on the part of the plaintiff is a condition 
precedent to grant the relief of specific performance. The circumstance is material 
and relevant and is required to be considered by the Court while granting or refusing 
to grant the relief.  If the plaintiff fails to either ever or prove the same he must fail. 
A Court may not, therefore, grant to a plaintiff who has failed 
to to prove that he has performed or has always been ready 
and willing to perform his part of the agreement, the specific 
performance whereof he seeks (See Ram Awadh v. Achhaibar 
Dubey, AIR 2000 SC 860).  
The explanation states that for the purpose of clause (c), (i) where a contract 
involved the payment of money, it is not essential for the plaintiff to actually tender to 
the defendant or to deposit in Court any money except when so directed by the Court 
(ii) the plaintiff must ever performance of, or readiness and willingness to perform, the 
contract according to its construction. 
Section 17 sets out two more cases where specific performance cannot be 
enforced in favour of a vendor or lessor. It states that a contract to sell or let any 
immovable property cannot be specifically enforced in favour of vendor or lessor (a) 
who knowing himself not to have any title to the property, has contracted to sell or let 
the property; (b) who, though he entered into the contract believing that he had a good 
title to the property, cannot at the time fixed by the parties or by the Court for the 
completion of the sale or letting, give the purchaser or lessee a title free from 
reasonable doubt Sub-section (2) lays down that the provisions of Sub-section (1) shall 
also apply as far as may be, to contracts for the sale or hire of movable property. 
According to this Section, a contract to sell or hire property cannot be specifically 
enforced in favour of a seller or lessor if he had no title to the property. A person who 
knows that he has no title to the property but still enters into a contract with regard to 
that property, he cannot have the remedy of specific performance. It is the duty of the 
vendor to make a reasonable, clear and marketable title about which there must not 
be any rational doubt. 
Illustration 
A without C‘s authority contracts to sell to B an estate which A knows to belong to 
C. A cannot enforce specific performance of this contract even though C is willing to 
confirm it.

Non-enforcement except with variation 
According to Section 18, where a plaintiff seeks specific performance of a 
contract in writing, to which the defendant sets up a variation, the plaintiff cannot 
obtain the performance sought, except with the variation so set up in the following 
cases, namely: (a) where by fraud, mistake of fact or misrepresentation, the written 
contract of which performance is sought is in its terms or effect different from what 
the parties agreed to, or does not contain all the terms agreed to between the parties 
on the basis of which the defendant entered into the contract; (b) where the object of 
the parties was to produce a certain legal result which the contract as framed is not 
calculated to produce, (c) where the parties have subsequently to the execution of 
the contract, varied its terms. 
Illustration 
A contracts in writing to let a house to B for a certain term, at the rent of Rs. 100/- 
per month, putting it first into tenantable repair. The house turns out to be not worth 
repairing. So with B‘s consent, A pulls it down and erects a new house in its place. B 
contracting orally to pay rent at Rs. 120/- per month. B then sues to enforce specific 
performance of the contract in writing. He cannot enforce it except with the variations 
made by the subsequent oral contract. 
7. DISCRETION OF THE COURT 
Sub-section (1) of Section 20 lays down that the jurisdiction to decree specific 
performance is discretionary, and the Court is not bound to grant such relief merely 
because it is lawful to do so, but the discretion of the Court is not arbitrary but based 
on sound and reasonable grounds guided by judicial principles and capable of 
correction by a Court of appeal. Sub-section (2) lays down that the following are 
cases in which the Court may properly exercise discretion not to decree specific 
performance — (a) where the terms of the contract or the conduct of the parties at 
the time of entering into the contract or the other circumstances under which the 
contract was entered into are such that the contract, though not voidable, gives the 
plaintiff an unfair advantage over the defendant; (b) where the performance of the 
contract would involve some hardship on the defendant which he did not foresee 
whereas its non-performance would involve no such hardship on the plaintiff;  
(c) where the defendant entered into the contract under circumstances which though 
not rendering the contract voidable, makes it inequitable to enforce specific 
performance. Explanation 1 appended to the Section states that mere inadequacy of 
consideration, or the mere fact that the contract is onerous to the defendant or 
improvident in its nature, shall not be deemed to constitute an unfair advantage within 
the meaning of clause (a) or hardship within the meaning of clause (b) Explanation 2 
to the Section says that the question whether the performance of a contract would 
involve hardship on the defendant within the meaning of clause (b) shall, except in 
cases where the hardship has resulted from any act of the plaintiff subsequent to the 
contract, be determined with reference to the circumstances existing at the time of 
the contract. 
Sub-section (3) lays down that Court may properly exercise discretion to decree 
specific performance in any case where the plaintiff has done substantial acts or 
suffered losses in consequences of a contract capable of specific performance. Sub-
EP-GCL-3 
102 
section (4) says that the court shall not refuse to any party specific performance of a 
contract merely on the ground that the contract is not enforceable at the instance of 
the other party. Specific performance is a discretionary remedy. The Court is not 
bound to decree specific performance merely because it is lawful to do so. Courts 
can take into consideration the conduct of the parties and the circumstances 
attending its execution and may exercise a discretion in granting or withholding a 
decree for specific performance (Jethalal v. Bachu, 47 Bom. 46). However, this 
discretion is not an arbitrary discretion but one governed by sound principles of 
equity.  It has been held that the court is not bound to grant relief of specific 
performance even if it is lawful to do so. [Yellapa Sastri v. Gunda Shankara, AIR 
2010 (NOC) 731 A.P. See also AIR 2008 SC 1786]. 
Illustration 
In Dennev-light (1857) 8 D M & G 774, the Court refused specific performance 
against a buyer where the land contracted to be purchased was wholly surrounded by 
land belonging to others over which there was no right of way. 
It is to be noted that the word ‗mere‘ has to be given due weight. Specific 
performance may be refused where inadequacy of consideration is coupled with 
some other factor not necessarily amounting to fraud, e.g. mistake, or surprise, or 
unfair advantage taken by the plaintiff of his superior knowledge or bargaining 
position even though the circumstances do not justify rescission of the contract. 
The hardship to be considered is at the time of the contract, unless the hardship 
has been brought on by the action of the plaintiff. Mere rise in price of the property 
agreed to be sold is not a ground for refusing a discretionary relief in favour of  
the purchaser. What has to be considered is the fairness of the contract at the time it 
was made and the subsequent rise in price is not a matter to be taken into 
consideration. 
Court‘s power to award damages in certain cases 
Under Section 21 of the Specific Relief Act, the Court is empowered to award 
compensation in certain cases. Sub-section (1) states that in a suit for specific 
performance of a contract, the plaintiff may also claim compensation for its breach, 
either in addition to, or in substitution of such performance, Sub-section (2) states 
that if, in any suit the Court decides that specific performance ought not to be granted 
but that there is a contract between the parties which has been broken by the 
defendant and that the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for that breach, it shall 
award him such compensation accordingly. Sub-section 3 lays down that if, in any 
such suit the Court decides that specific performance ought to be granted, but that it 
is not sufficient to satisfy the justice of the case, and that some compensation for 
breach of the contract should also be made to the plaintiff, it shall award him such 
compensation accordingly. Sub-section (4) states that in determining the amount of 
any compensation awarded under this section, the Court shall be guided by the 
principles specified in Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Sub-section 5 lays 
down that no compensation shall be awarded under this Section unless the plaintiff 
has claimed such compensation in his plaint provided that where the plaintiff has not 
claimed any such compensation in the plaint, the Court shall at any stage at the 
proceeding, allow him to amend the plaint on such terms as may be just for including 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
103 
a claim for such compensation. Even if the contract has become incapable of specific 
performance that does not preclude the Court from exercising the jurisdiction 
conferred by this section. 
The conditions according to which damages may be awarded by the Court in 
addition to specific performance are: 
 
(i) the Court decides that specific performance ought to be granted but, 
 
(ii) the justice of the case requires that not only specific performance but also 
some compensation for the breach of the contract should also be given to 
the plaintiff. 
 
 In a suit for specific performance, the plaintiff may ask for damages in the 
alternative or in addition to specific performance of the contract. The Court‘s 
power to award damages in a suit for specific performance is laid down in 
Section 21. 
The circumstances in which a court would award damages in lieu of specific 
performance: 
 
(a) Specific performance could have been granted but in the circumstances of 
the case the Court in its discretion considers that it would be better to award 
damages instead of specific performance. 
 
(b) Though specific performance is refused, plaintiff is entitled to compensation 
for breach of the contract. 
 
(c) If the circumstances are such that specific performance would not be 
granted; for example, where the plaintiff has disentitled himself to the 
specific performance, damages cannot be awarded under Section 21 in lieu 
of specific performance. 
Section 22 gives power to the Court to grant relief for possession, partitions, 
refund of earnest money. Under Section 22 any person, suing for the specific 
performance of a contract for the transfer of immovable property may, in an 
appropriate case ask for (a) possession or partition and separate possession, of the 
property in addition to any such performance; or (b) any other relief to which he may 
be entitled in case his claim for specific performance is refused. 
The power of the Court to grant relief under clause (b) shall be without prejudice 
to its power to award compensation under Section 21. 
Illustrations 
(a) A conveys land to B, who bequeaths it to C and dies. Thereupon D gets 
possession of the land and produces a forged instrument stating that the conveyance 
was made to B in trust for him. C may obtain the cancellation of the forged 
instrument. 
(b) A, representing that the tenants on his land were all at will, sells it to B, and 
conveys it to him by an instrument dated the 1st January 1877. Soon after that day, A 
fraudulently grants to C a lease of part of the land, and procures the lease dated the 
1st October, 1876 to be registered under the Indian Registration Act. B may obtain 
the cancellation of this lease. 
EP-GCL-3

? 
On such cancellation, the Court may require the party to whom such relief is 
granted to restore as far as may be any benefit which he may have received from the 
other party and to make any compensation to him which justice may require. 
In a case defendant and plaintiff were real brothers residing jointly in a 
house. The defendant executed agreement to sell the property of his share in 
favour of plaintiff. Subsequently he sold the same property to another 
purchaser. The subsequent purchaser had no knowledge about the earlier 
agreement. It was held that he is the bona-fide purchaser of the property. The 
plaintiff can recover back earnest money paid by him to defendant (Jagtar 
Singh v. Gurmit Singh, AIR 2006 P&H 62).

State whether the following statement is” true” or “false”. 
Under the Specific Relief Act, a Court can give either specific relief or compensatory 
relief and not both. 
 
True 
 
False 
Correct Answer: True 
 
Section 23 lays down that even if the parties have agreed for liquidated 
damages, in the contract itself, specific performance of that contract may be decreed 
by the Court in proper cases but in that case the payment of the sum named in the 
contract will not be decreed. 
Section 24 imposes a bar on suit for compensation for breach of a contract after 
dismissal of the suit for specific performance. 
8. RECTIFICATION OF INSTRUMENTS 
Section 26 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 contains the law as to rectification of 
instruments. 
Rectification means correction of an error in an instrument in order to give effect 
to the real intention of the parties. Where a contract reduced into writing in pursuance 
of a previous agreement, fails to express the real intention of the parties, the court will 
rectify the instrument in accordance with their true intention. Here, there must be in 
existence as between the parties, a complete and perfectly unobjectionable contract; 
but the writing designed to embody it, either from fraud or mutual mistake, is incorrect 
or imperfect and the relief sought is to rectify the writing so as to bring it into 
confirmity with the true intention. In such a case, if such instrument is enforced, one 
party will suffer and if it is rescinded altogether both the parties will suffer but if it is 
rectified and enforced neither party will suffer. The principle on which the courts act in 
correcting instruments is that the parties are to be placed in the same position as that 
in which they would have stood if no error had been committed (Sudha Singh v. 
Munshi Ram, A.I.R. 1927 Cal. 605). There must have been a complete agreement 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
105 
prior to the instrument. It should be in writing and there must be clear evidence of 
mutual mistake or of fraud. 
In order to obtain rectification the conditions mentioned in Section 26 must be 
present. Thus: 
 
(i) Rectification would be granted where, though there was a consensus 
between the parties as to the contract through fraud of one of the parties, 
the instrument did not correctly express the real intention. 
 
(ii) It will also be granted, at the instance of third party, where both the parties 
are equally innocent, but owing to a common mistake, the instrument does 
not express their intention. 
 
(iii) Sub-section (2) makes it clear that rectification would not be allowed so as to 
prejudice rights acquired by third party in good faith and for value. 
 
 For example, A intending to sell to B his house and one of three godowns 
adjacent to it, executes a conveyance prepared by B in which through B‘s 
fraud, all three godowns are included. Of the two godowns which were 
fraudulently included, B gives one to C and let the other to D for a rent, 
neither C nor D having any knowledge of the fraud. The conveyance may, 
as against B and C, be rectified so as to exclude from it the godown given to 
C, but it cannot be rectified so as to affect D‘s lease. 
 
(iv) The only limitation placed on the Courts discretion is that the rectification 
can be done without prejudice to the rights acquired by third persons in good 
faith and for value. 
9. RESCISSION OF CONTRACTS 
Section 27 deals with Rescission of Contracts. ―Rescission‖ means putting an 
end to a contract which is still operative and making it null and void ab initio. It does 
not apply to void contracts. Section 27 states the principle upon which rescission can 
be ordered. A person suing for rescission cannot, in the alternative sue for specific 
performance but a person suing for specific performance can sue for rescission.  
Sub-section (1) lays down that any person interested in a contract may sue to have it 
rescinded, and such rescission may be adjudged by the Court in any of the following 
cases, namely – (a) where the contract is voidable or terminable by the plaintiff;  
(b) where the contract is unlawful for causes not apparent on its face and the 
defendant is more to blame than the plaintiff. Sub-section (2) lays down that 
notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-section (1), the Court may refuse to 
rescind the contract – (a) where the plaintiff has expressly or impliedly ratified the 
contract; or (b) where, owing to the change of circumstances which has taken place 
since the making of the contract (not being due to any act of the defendant himself), 
the parties cannot be substantially restored to the position in which they stood when 
the contract was made; or (c) where third-parties have, during the subsistence of the 
contract, acquired rights in good faith without notice and for value; or (d) where only a 
part of the contract is sought to be rescinded and such part is not severable from the 
rest of the contract. The explanation provides that in this Section, ―contract‖ in relation 
to the territories to which the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, does not extend, means 
a contract in writing. 
EP-GCL-3 
106 
? 
―This specie of specific relief is the reverse of specific performance. In one case 
the relief is granted by enforcing the performance of a contract which binds the 
parties, and the other by discharging him when it is not just to bind him‖ (Banerjee). 
So the equitable relief by way of rescission is exactly opposite of specific 
performance. Here, the contract is put to an end and is made null and void where by 
the contractual obligations also come to an end. Section 27 provides ground to the 
aggrieved party to rescind a contract without obtaining consent of the other party. 
Under clause (a) where a contract is voidable or terminable by the plaintiff, he 
may rescind it. The contract may become voidable or terminable due to fraud, undue 
influence, misrepresentation or coercion. 
Any person interested in a contract may sue to have it rescinded. Hence a suit 
may be brought by a third party whose interests are affected by the contract. 
In case of a rescission of a contract, the Court may, in its discretion, require the 
party to whom such relief is granted to make any compensation to the other party. 
The main object of this relief is to put both the parties in their original positions. If a 
plaintiff fails to get specific performance of a contract in writing, he may get it 
rescinded and delivered up to be cancelled. 
Doctrine of part performance 
The doctrine of part performance has been applied in India to the contracts of 
transfer of immovable property which though required to be registered have not been 
registered. The doctrine has been given statutory recognition in 1929 adding two new 
sections to Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act and Section 27A to the 
Specific Relief Act, and a proviso to Section 49 of the Indian Registration Act.

Correct answer: (a), (b) and (c) 
 
10. CANCELLATION OF INSTRUMENTS 
Sub-section (1) of Section 31 provides that any person against whom a written 
instrument is void or voidable, and who has reasonable apprehension that such 
instrument, if left outstanding may cause him serious injury, may sue to have it 
adjudged void or voidable, and the Court may in its discretion, so adjudge it and order 
it to be delivered up and cancelled. Sub-section (2) lays down that if the instrument 
has been registered under the Indian Registration Act, 1908, the Court shall also 
send a copy of its decree to the officer in whose office the instrument has been so 
registered; and such officer shall note on the copy of the instrument contained in his 
books the fact of its cancellation. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
107 
The relief of cancellation of instruments is founded upon the administration of 
protective justice which is technically known as ―Quia time‖. It is based upon the 
administration of protective justice for fear that the instrument may be vexatiously, or 
injuriously used by the defendant against the plaintiff when the evidence to impeach it 
may be lost or that it may throw a cloud of suspicion over the title or interest 
(Jekadula v. Bai Jini, 39 B T R.,1072). 
Relief of cancellation under Section 31 would be available when (i) an instrument 
is void or voidable against the plaintiff; (ii) where the plaintiff may apprehend serious 
injury if the instrument is left outstanding and (iii) where it is proper under the 
circumstances of the case to grant the relief. 
Illustrations 
(a) A, the owner of a ship, by fraudulently representing her to be seaworthy, 
induces B, an underwriter, to insure her. B may obtain the cancellation of the policy.  
(b) A agrees to sell and deliver a ship to B, to be paid for by B‘s acceptance of 
four bills of exchange, for sums amounting to Rs. 30,000, to be drawn by A on B. The 
bills are drawn and accepted, but the ship is not delivered according to the 
agreement. A sues B on one of the bills. B may obtain the cancellation of all the bills 
(Anglo Danubian Co. v. Rogerson (1867) L.R. 4 Eq. 3). 
Section 32 lays down that where an instrument is evidence of different rights or 
different obligations, the Court may, in proper case, cancel it in part and allow it to 
stand for the residue. The Court is not bound to cancel the whole of the instrument 
but may, in its discretion, when necessary, cancel it in part and allow rest of it to 
stand. 
A executes a deed of mortgage in favour of B. A gets back the deed from B by 
fraud and endorses on it a receipt for Rs. 1,200 purporting to be signed by B. B‘s 
signature is forged. B is entitled to have the endorsement cancelled, leaving the deed 
to stand in other respects (Ram Chandar v. Ganga Saran, (1917) 39 All. 103). 
Section 33(1) provides that on adjudging the cancellation of an instrument, the 
Court may require the party to whom such relief is granted, to restore, so far as may 
be, any benefit which he may have received from the other party and to make any 
compensation to him which justice may require. The provisions of this Section are 
almost similar to the provisions of Section 30 of this Act. Under both the Sections, the 
plaintiff must make such compensation to the defendant as the justice may require. 
11. DECLARATORY DECREES 
A declaratory decree is a decree whereby any right as to any property or the 
legal character of a person is judicially ascertained.  
The Supreme Court in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Mangilal 
Sharma, 1997 (7) SCALE 783, held that a declaratory decree 
merely declares the right of the decreehoder vis-a-vis the 
judgement debtor and does not in terms direct the 
judgement debtor to do or refrain from doing any particular 
act or thing. It cannot be executed as it only declares the 
rights of the decree-holder qua the judgement debtor and 
does not, in terms, direct him to do or refrain from doing any particular act or 
thing. 
EP-GCL-3 
108 
Section 34 lays down that any person entitled to any legal character, or to any 
right as to any property, may institute a suit against any person denying, or interested 
to deny, his title to such character or right, and the Court may in its discretion make 
therein a declaration that he is so entitled and the plaintiff need not in such suit ask 
for any further relief provided that no Court shall make any such declaration where 
the plaintiff, being able to seek further relief than a mere declaration of title, omits to 
do so. The explanation provides that a trustee of property is a ―person interested to 
deny‖ a title adverse to the title of someone who is not in existence, and for whom, if 
in existence, he would be a trustee. 
The object of declaratory decree is to remove doubt by having legal status of any 
rights declared by the Court, and to perpertuate and strengthen testimony regarding 
title and protect it from adverse attacks. One of the objects of the legislature was to 
allow the right to enjoy the property rightfully belonging to the plaintiff. In case of 
declaratory decree, neither specific performance nor any compensation is awarded 
but only a declaration of the rights of the parties is made without any consequential 
relief being granted. The declaration does not confer any new rights upon the plaintiff 
but it merely declares what he had before. It only clears the mist that has gathered 
round the plaintiff‘s title or status. The Court is being asked to put an end to the 
dispute and uncertainty by determining the legal character in issue. By that way the 
property may be put to better use, enjoyment and improvement. To maintain a suit 
under this Section following conditions must be fulfilled: 
 
(a) the plaintiff must be a person entitled to any legal character or to any right as 
to any property; 
 
(b) the defendant must be a person denying or interested to deny the plaintiff‘s 
title to such legal character or, right; 
 
(c) the declaration issued for must be a declaration that the plaintiff is entitled to 
a legal character or to a right to property; and 
 
(d) where the plaintiff is able to seek further relief than a mere declaration he 
must seek such relief. 
Illustration 
A is properly in possession of certain lands. The inhabitants of a neighbouring 
village claim a right of way across the land. A may use for a declaration that they are 
not entitled to the right so claimed. 
The relief by way of declaration is purely discretionary. Instances of legal 
characters are — 
 
(1) Divorce on the ground of impotency 
 
(2) Legal character by marriage 
 
(3) Legitimacy or illegitimacy 
 
(4) Status of an adopted son 
 
(5) Priest of temple 
Effect of Declaration 
Section 35 lays down that a declaration is binding only on the parties to the suit, 
persons claiming through them respectively, and where any of the parties are 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
109 
trustees, on the persons for whom, if in existence at the date of the declaration, such 
parties would be trustees. 
Such a declaration is not judgement in rem and as such it cannot bind strangers. 
Illustration 
A, a Hindu, in a suit to which B, his alleged wife is the defendant‘s seeks a 
declaration that his marriage was duly solemnised and prays for an order of 
restitution of conjugal rights. The Court makes the declaration and order of restitution 
of conjugal rights. C, a third-party claiming that B is his wife, sues A for the recovery 
of B. The declaration made in the former suit is not binding upon C. 
12. PREVENTIVE RELIEFS 
Part III of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 grants specific relief called Preventive 
Relief i.e., preventing a party from doing that which he is under an obligation not to 
do. Preventive relief is granted at the discretion of the court by way of an injunction. 
An injunction is a specific order of the Court forbidding the commission of a 
wrong threatened or the continuance of a wrongful course of action already begun, or 
in some cases (when it is called a ‗mandatory injunction‘) commanding active 
restitution of the former state of things. 
Lord Halsbury defines injunction as ―a judicial process whereby a party is ordered 
to refrain from doing or to do a particular act or thing‖. 
The main difference between an injunction and specific performance is that the 
remedy in case of an injunction is generally directed to prevent the violation of a 
negative act and therefore deals not only with contracts but also with torts and many 
other subjects of purely equitable one, whereas specific performance is directed to 
compelling performance of an active duty. 
It is known as a ―judicial process by which one, who has invaded or is threatening 
to invade the rights (legal or equitable) of another is restrained from continuing or 
commencing such wrongful act. Injunction is the most ordinary form of preventive 
relief. For the effective administration of justice, this power to prevent and to restrain 
is absolutely necessary. 
Characteristics of an injunction 
An injunction has three characteristic features; 
 
(a) It is a judicial process. 
 
(b) The object of this judicial process is to restrain or to prevent. 
 
(c) The act restrained or prevented is a wrongful act. An injuction acts or 
operates always in personam. 
If the wrongful act has already taken place, the injunction prevents its repetition. 
If it is merely threatened, the threat is prevented from being executed. 
Temporary and perpetual injunctions 
Section 36 states that preventive relief is granted at the discretion of the Court by 
injunction, temporary or perpetual. 
EP-GCL-3 
110 
The temporary injunctions are granted under Order 39 Rules 1-2 of the Civil 
Procedure Code while perpetual injunctions are dealt within Section 38 of the Specific 
Relief Act. 
The temporary injunction may be dissolved at any time under Civil Procedure 
Code by the defendant showing specific cause to the satisfaction of the Court against 
the order granting the injunction, or it automatically terminate with the disposal of the 
suit. The general principles governing temporary and permanent injunctions are 
mainly the same except that a temporary injunction is granted before the plaintiff 
establishes his case at the trial. 
Sub-section (1) of Section 37 lays down that temporary injunctions are such as 
are to continue until a specified time, or until the further order of the Court and they 
may be granted at any stage of a suit, and are regulated by the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908. 
Sub-section (2) states that a perpetual injunction can only be granted by the 
decree made at the hearing and upon the merits of the suit; the defendant is thereby 
perpetually enjoined from the assertion of right, or from the commission of an act, 
which would be contrary to the rights of the Plaintiff. It may be pointed out that: 
 
(i) While Section 37(1) of the Act gives the meaning of a perpetual injunction, 
Sections 37 to 62 lay down the principles according to which the perpetual 
injunction would be granted. 
 
(ii) The cases in which the perpetual injunction may be granted are of two 
classes. The object is to prevent the breach of an obligation existing in 
favour of the applicant, but such obligation may either arise out of a contract 
or otherwise. In case of contractual agreement principles governing specific 
performance will apply and in other cases, the injunction would be granted if 
the plaintiff can show that the defendant has a legal duty or obligation 
towards him and that by the non-performance of such duty the right to 
enjoyment of property has been materially affected. Such cases are where 
the defendant is trustee of the property of the plaintiff or where the injunction 
is necessary to prevent multiplicity of judicial proceedings, etc. 
Section 38 deals with granting of perpetual injunction. Sub-section (1) states that 
subject to the other provisions contained in or referred to by this chapter, a perpetual 
injunction may be granted to the plaintiff to prevent the breach of an obligation 
existing in his favour whether express or by implication. 
Sub-section (2) provides that when any such obligation arises from contract, the 
Court shall be guided by the rules and provisions contained in Chapter II, i.e., the 
chapter on specific performance of contracts. Sub-section (3) lays down that when 
the defendant invades or threatens to invade the plaintiff‘s right to, or enjoyment of 
property, the Court may grant a perpetual injunction in the following cases, namely: 
(a) where the defendant is a trustee of the property for the plaintiff; (b) where there 
exists no standard for ascertaining the actual damage caused, or likely to be caused 
by the invasion; (c) where the invasion is such that compensation in money would not 
afford adequate relief; (d) where the injunction is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of 
judicial proceedings.

(b) Legal character by marriage 
 
(c) Status of an adopted son 
 
(d) Status of a relative  
Correct answer: (a), (b) and (c) 
 
Difference between the remedies of specific performance and injunction  
Specific performance is decreed to compel the performance of an active duty, while 
injunction is decreed to prevent the violation of a negative duty. Normally, the former 
deals with contracts, while the latter with torts and other subjects of equitable nature. If 
a contract is positive in its nature, it calls for the relief of specific performance, on the 
other hand, if it is negative in its nature, it calls for relief of injunction. 
The principle governing the award of injunction as a mode of enforcement of 
contracts is similar to that of specific performance. This is clearly borne out by 
Section 38(2) of the Act. Thus, the enforcement of a contract is governed by both 
specific relief and injunction. ―The jurisdiction of equity to grant such injunction is 
substantially coexistent with its jurisdiction to compel a specific performance‖. But still 
their fields of operation are separate from each other. While a promise to do is 
enforced by specific performance, a promise to forbear is enforced by injunction. 
Section 41(e) further provides that contract which will not be affirmatively enforced by 
a decree of specific performance, will not be negatively enforced by issuing an 
injunction. The only exception to this rule is found in Section 42. 
Mandatory injunction 
Section 39 dealing with mandatory injunctions states that when to prevent the 
breach of an obligation, it is necessary to compel the performance of certain acts 
which the Court is capable of enforcing, the Court may in its discretion grant an 
injunction to prevent the breach complained of, and also to compel performance of 
the requisite acts. For example, A builds a house with eaves projecting over B‘s land, 
B may sue for an injunction to pull down so much of the eaves as so projecting over 
his land. 
According to Section 40, the plaintiff in a suit for perpetual injunction under 
Section 38 or mandatory injunction under Section 39, may claim damages either in 
addition to, or in substitution for such injunction and the Court, may, if it thinks fit, 
award such damages. 
Injunction when refused 
Section 41 gives a list of cases in which a perpetual injunction cannot be granted. 
It says that an injunction cannot be granted — (a) to restrain any person from 
prosecuting a judicial proceeding pending at the institution of the suit in which the 
injunction is sought, unless such restraint is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of 
proceedings; (b) to restrain any person from instituting or prosecuting any proceeding 
EP-GCL-3 
112 
in a Court not subordinate to that from which the injunction is sought; (c) to restrain 
any person from applying to any legislative body; (d) to restrain any person from 
instituting or prosecuting any proceeding in a criminal matter; (e) to prevent the 
breach of a contract the performance of which would not be specifically enforced;  
(f) to prevent on the ground of nuisance, an act of which it is not reasonably clear that 
it will be nuisance; (g) to prevent a continuing breach in which the plaintiff has 
acquiesced; (h) when equally efficacious relief can certainly be obtained by any other 
usual mode of proceeding except in case of breach of trust; (i) when the conduct of 
the plaintiff or his agents has been such as to disentitle him to the assistance of the 
Court; (j) when the plaintiff has no interest in the matter. 
It may be noted that this relief also is a discretionary remedy. It may be refused 
even if the case is not covered by Section 41. 
Injunction to perform negative agreement 
Section 42 provides that notwithstanding anything contained in clause (e) of 
Section 41, where a contract comprises an affirmative agreement to do a certain act, 
coupled with negative agreement, express or implied, not to do a certain act, the 
circumstance that the Court is unable to compel specific performance of the 
affirmative agreement shall not preclude it from granting an injunction to perform the 
negative agreement, provided that the plaintiff has not failed to perform the contract 
so far as it is binding on him. 
This Section is based upon an English case viz., Lumley v. Wagner (21) L.J. CH. 
898. In this case Miss W, a singer agreed to sing at L’s 
theatre for a certain period and not to sing anywhere else 
during that period. Afterwards, she entered into a contract 
to sing at another theatre and refused to perform her 
contract with L. The Court refused to enforce her positive 
agreement to sing at L’s theatre (by specific performance 
since it is based on personal volition) but granted an 
injunction restraining her from singing at any other theatre thereby preventing 
breach of the negative part of the agreement though the positive part of it, 
being a contract for the personal service, could not be specifically enforced. 
Conditions necessary for the applicability of this Section are: 
 
(1) The contract should comprise of two agreements, one affirmative and 
another negative. 
 
(2) Both the agreements must be divisible. 
 
(3) The negative agreement must relate to a specific act. 
 
(4) The Court should be unable to compel specific performace of the affirmative 
agreement. 
 
(5) The plaintiff must not have failed to perform the contract, so far as it is 
binding upon him. 
A negative stipulation may be express or implied. An express negative stipulation 
in one where the negative stipulation is put expressly. The Section does not say that 
every affirmative contract includes by necessary implication a negative agreement to 
refrain from doing certain things. It is therefore a question of interpretation in each 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
113 
case to find whether a particular contract can be said to have a negative stipulation, 
express or implied, contained in it, e.g., the mere use of word ―exclusively‖ does not 
imply a negative stipulation to refrain from service of other people. 
The provisions of this Section are based on the equitable principle that ―he who 
seeks equity must do equity‖. 
The principle as laid down in Section 42 was followed in the cases of Burn 
Mcdonald (1907) 36 Cal 354; Metropolitan Electric Supply v. Ginder, (1901) 2 Ch. 
799; Subba Naidu v. Hari Badshah, (13 M.L.J. 13); and Madras Rly Co. v. Rust, 
(1891) 14 Mad 18. 
II.  LAW RELATING TO ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION 
Arbitration is the means by which parties to a dispute get the same settled 
through the intervention of a third person (or more persons) but without recourse to a 
court of law. The settlement of dispute is arrived by the judgement of the third person 
(or more persons) who are called Arbitrators. The parties repose confidence in the 
judgement of the arbitrator and show their willingness to abide by his decision. The 
essence of arbitration is thus based upon the principle of keeping away the dispute 
from the ordinary Courts enabling the parties to substitute by a domestic tribunal. It is, 
therefore, a reference of the matter of disputes to the decision of one or more 
persons between the disputing parties. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The history of the law of arbitration in India commences with Act VIII of 1859 
which codified the procedure of Civil Courts. Sections 312 to 325 of Act VIII of 1859 
dealt with arbitration between the parties to a suit while Sections 326 and 327 dealt 
with arbitration without the intervention of the Court. These provisions were in 
operation when the Indian Contract Act, 1872, came into force which permitted 
settlement of disputes by arbitration under Section 28 thereof. Act VIII of 1859 was 
followed by later codes relating to Civil Procedure, namely, Act X of 1877 and Act XIV 
of 1882 but not much change was brought about by the law relating to arbitration 
proceedings. It was in the year 1899 that an Indian Act entitled the Arbitration Act of 
1899 came to be passed. It was based on the model of the English Act of 1899. The 
1899 Act applied to cases where if the subject matter submitted to the arbitration was 
the subject of a suit, the suit could whether with leave or otherwise, be instituted in a 
Presidency town. Then came the Code of Civil Procedure of 1908. Schedule II to the 
said Code contained the provisions relating to the law of arbitration which extended to 
the other parts of British India. 
The Civil Justice Committee in 1925 recommended several changes in the 
arbitration law. On the basis of the recommendations by the Civil Justice Committee, 
the Indian Legislature passed the Act, i.e., the Arbitration Act of 1940. This Act as its 
preamble indicates is a consolidating and amending Act and is an exhaustive code 
insofar as the law relating to arbitration is concerned. An arbitration may be without 
the intervention of a Court or with the intervention of a Court where there is no suit 
pending or it may be an arbitration in a suit. 
With the passage of time the 1940 Act became outmoded, and need was 
expressed by the Law Commission of India and various representative bodies of 
trade and industry for its amendment so as to be more responsive to the 
contemporary requirements, and to render Indian economic reforms more effective.

? 
Besides, arbitration, other mechanisms of settlement of disputes such as mediation 
or conciliation should have legal recognition and the settlement agreement reached 
between the parties as a result of such mechanism should have the same status and 
effect as an arbitral award on agreed terms. 
2. ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT, 1996 
With a view to consolidate and amend the law relating to domestic arbitration, 
international commercial arbitration, enforcement of foreign arbitral awards and also 
to provide for a law relating to conciliation and related matters, a new law called 
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 has been passed. The new Law is based on 
United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), model law on 
International Commercial Arbitration. 
The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 aims at streamlining the process of 
arbitration and facilitating conciliation in business matters. The Act recognizes the 
autonomy of parties in the conduct of arbitral proceedings by the arbitral tribunal and 
abolishes the scope of judicial review of the award and minimizes the supervisory 
role of Courts. A significant feature of the Act is the appointment of arbitrators by the 
Chief Justice of India or Chief Justice of High Court. The Chief Justice may either 
appoint the arbitrator himself or nominate a person or Institution to nominate the 
arbitrator. The autonomy of the arbitral tribunal has further been strengthened by 
empowering them to decide on jurisdiction and to consider objections regarding the 
existence or validity of the arbitration agreement. 
The Act has been divided into four Parts and contains three Schedules. Part one 
deals with Arbitration (Sections 2 to 43); Part two deals with enforcement of certain 
Foreign Awards (Sections 44 to 60); Part three deals with conciliation (Sections 61 to 
81); and Part four contains supplementary provisions (Sections 82 to 86). Similarly 
schedule one contains provisions relating to convention on the Recognition and 
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards; Schedule two deals with Protocol on 
Arbitration Clauses and Schedule three contains provisions relating to Execution of 
Foreign Arbitral Awards.

3. IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS 
Arbitration 
Section 2(1) (a) of the Act, defines the term ―arbitration‖ as to mean any 
arbitration whether or not administered by a permanent arbitral institution. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
115 
Arbitrator 
The term ―arbitrator‖ is not defined in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. But 
―arbitrator‖ is a person who is appointed to determine differences and disputes 
between two or more parties by their mutual consent. It is not enough that the parties 
appoint an arbitrator. The person who is so appointed must also give his consent to 
act as an arbitrator. His appointment is not complete till he has accepted the 
reference. The arbitrator must be absolutely disinterested and impartial. He is an 
extra-judicial tribunal whose decision is binding on the parties. 
Any interest of the arbitrator either in one of the parties or in the subject-matter of 
reference unknown to either of the parties or all the parties, as the case may be, is a 
disqualification for the arbitrator. Such disqualification applies only in the case of a 
concealed interest. If the arbitrator has an interest in the subject-matter of reference 
well-known to the parties before they sign the submission, the award is good 
notwithstanding his own interest. Every disclosure which might in the least affect the 
minds of those who are proposing to submit their disputes to the arbitration of any 
particular individual as regards his selection and fitness for the post ought to be made 
so that each party may have an opportunity of considering whether the reference to 
arbitration to that particular individual should or should not be made. 
The parties may appoint whomsoever they please to arbitrate on their dispute. 
Usually the parties themselves appoint the arbitrator or arbitrators. In certain cases, 
the Court can appoint an arbitrator or umpire. The parties to an arbitration agreement 
may agree that any reference thereunder shall be referred to an arbitrator or 
arbitrators to be appointed by a person designated in the agreement either by name 
or as the holder for the time being of any office or appointment. For example, the 
parties may agree that the arbitrator shall be appointed by Mr. X or the head of a 
certain institution. 
Arbitral Award 
As per Section 2(1)(c), "arbitral award" includes an interim award. The 
definition does not give much details of the ingredients of an arbitral 
award. However, taking into account other provisions of the Act, the 
following features are noticed: 
 
1. An arbitration agreement is required to be in writing. Similarly, a reference to 
arbitration and award is also required to be made in writing. The arbitral 
award is required to be made on stamp paper of prescribed value (as 
applicable at the place of making the award) and in writing. An oral decision 
is not an award under the law. 
 
2. The award is to be signed by the members of the arbitral tribunal. However, 
the signature of majority of the members of the tribunal is sufficient if the 
reason for any omitted signature is stated. 
 
3. The making of an award is a rational process which is accentuated by 
recording the reasons. The award should contain reasons. However, there 
are two exceptions where an award without reasons is valid i.e. 
 
(a) Where the arbitration agreement expressly provides that no reasons are 
to be given, or 
EP-GCL-3 
116 
 
(b) Where the award has been made under Section 30 of the Act i.e. where 
the parties settled the dispute and the arbitral tribunal has recorded the 
settlement in the form of an arbitral award on agreed terms. 
 
 The formulation of reasons is a powerful discipline and it may lead the 
arbitrator to change his initial view on the matter. Recording of reasons 
involves, analysis of the dispute to reach a logical conclusion. Award can be 
divided into four parts i.e. general, findings of fact, submissions of the parties 
and conclusions of the tribunal. The tribunal should explain its view of the 
evidence and reasons of its conclusions. The preamble of the award may 
contain reference to the arbitration agreement, constitution of the tribunal, 
procedure adopted by the tribunal etc. and the second part of the award 
may contain points at issue, argument for the claimant, argument for the 
respondent and findings of the tribunal. The points at issue may be divided 
into two heads i.e. issue of fact and issue of law. 
 
4. The award should be dated i.e. the date of making of the award should be 
mentioned in the award. 
 
5. Place of arbitration is important for the determination of rules applicable to 
substance of dispute, and recourse against the award. The arbitral tribunal is 
under obligation to state the place of arbitration as determined in 
accordance with Section 20. Place of arbitration refers to the jurisdiction of 
the Court of a particular city or State. 
 
6. The arbitral tribunal may include in the sum for which award is made, 
interest upto the date of award and also a direction regarding future interest. 
 
7. The award may also include decisions and directions of the arbitrator 
regarding the cost of the arbitration. 
 
8. After the award is made, a signed copy should be delivered to each party for 
appropriate action like implementation or recourse against arbitral award. 
Arbitral Tribunal 
―Arbitral tribunal‖ means a sole arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators. 
[Section 2(1)(d)]. 
Court 
―Court‖ means the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district and 
includes the High Court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, having 
jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject matter of the arbitration if the 
same had been the subject matter of a suit, but does not include any Civil Court of a 
grade inferior to such principal Civil Court or any Court of Small Causes. 
[Section 2(1)(e)] 
International Commercial Arbitration 
―International commercial arbitration‖ means an arbitration relating to disputes 
arising out of legal relationships, whether contractual or not, considered as 
commercial under law in force in India and where at least one of the parties is: 
 
(i) an individual who is a national of, or habitual resident in, any country other 
than India; or 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
117 
 
(ii) a body corporate which is incorporated in any country other than India; or 
 
(iii) a company or an association or a body of individuals whose central 
management and control is exercised in any country other than India; or 
 
(iv) the Government of a foreign country. [Section 2(1)(f)] 
Legal Representative 
The definition of ―legal representative‖ given under Section 2(1)(g) has been 
taken verbatim from the definition in Section 2(11) of the Code of Civil Procedure. 
The following are the persons who are legal representatives: 
 
(a) A person who in law represents the estate of a deceased person. 
 
(b) A person who intermeddles with the estate of the deceased. 
 
(c) A person on whom the estate of a deceased person devolves on the death 
of the party acting in a representative‘s capacity. 
The following persons are generally included in the list of legal representatives. 
 
(i) Executors and administrators properly appointed. 
 
(ii) Person who has taken on himself duties and responsibilities which belong to 
the executor or administrator though only in respect of a part of the estate. 
 
(iii) Heirs-at-law whether they take succession or by survivorship. 
 
(iv) Revisioners when the action has been brought by or against the widow 
representing her husband‘s estate. 
 
(v) Universal legatee. 
The following are the illustrations of those who do not come within the meaning of 
legal representative, so far as the Act is concerned: 
 
(i) An assignee from a deceased zamindar or to whom the holding reverts on 
the death of a tenant. 
 
(ii) A trespasser or a person who claims adversely the estate of the deceased. 
 
(iii) A new trustee appointed or elected on the death of the deceased trustee. 
Arbitration Agreement 
―Arbitration agreement‖ means an agreement referred to in Section 7 
[Section 2(1)(b)]. Under Section 7, the ―Arbitration agreement‖ has 
been defined to mean an agreement by parties to submit the 
arbitration or certain disputes which have arisen or which may arise 
between them in respect of a defined legal relationship whether contractual or not. 
Sub-section (2) says that an arbitration agreement may be in the form of an 
arbitration clause in a contract or in the form of a separate agreement. Sub-section 
(3) specifically states that an arbitration agreement shall be in writing. Sub-section (4) 
spells out that an arbitration agreement is in writing if it is contained in 
 
(a) a document signed by the parties, or 
 
(b) an exchange of letters, telex, telegrams or other means of telecommuni-
cation, which provide a record of the agreement, or 
 
(c) an exchange of statements of claim and defence in which the existence of 
the agreement is alleged by one party and not denied by the other. 
EP-GCL-3 
118 
Thus, arbitration agreement stands on the same footing as any 
other agreement. It is binding upon the parties unless it is influenced by 
fraud or coercion or undue influence, etc. As per Section 7, one of the 
essential ingredients of an arbitration agreement is that such an 
agreement should be in writing. An oral arbitration agreement is not recognised as an 
arbitration agreement according to this Section. 
Sub-section (5) states that the reference in a contract to a document containing 
an arbitration clause constitutes an arbitration agreement if the contract is in writing 
and the reference is such as to make that arbitration clause part of the contract. 
Sub-section (3) only requires that an agreement by the parties should be in writing. 
It is not necessary that the words arbitration, arbitrator or arbitration agreement should 
appear in the arbitration clause so long as the parties have valid agreement to allow the 
matter of dispute to be decided by persons of their own choice. 
Under the present law, certain disputes such as matrimonial disputes, criminal 
prosecutions, questions relating to guardianship about the validity of a will, etc. are 
treated as not suitable for arbitration. Subject to this qualification Section 7(1) of the 
Act makes it permissible to enter into an arbitration agreement ―in respect of a 
defined legal relationship, whether contractual or not‖. 
Under the old law, it was not clear whether an arbitrator can decide questions 
about the validity of the arbitration agreement itself or about the existence and validity 
of the arbitration clause proper. The new law expressly recognizes that the arbitrator 
will have such a power to commence or continue the arbitral proceedings though the 
objecting party can obtain a ruling of the court at the appropriate time.  
The Supreme Court in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. v. M/s Pink City 
Midway Petroleum, AIR 2003 SC 2881 has held that the jurisdiction of Civil 
Court is barred after an application under Section 8 of the Act is made for 
arbitration.  
In Mahesh Kumar v. Rajasthan State Road Corporation, AIR 2006 Raj 56, the 
Rajasthan High Court has held that mere existence of arbitration clause in agreement 
does not bar jurisdiction of Civil Court automatically. The objection of a party to the 
jurisdiction of the arbitrator must be raised not later than the submission of its first 
statement of defence on the substance of the dispute [Section 8(1) and 8(3)].

4. APPOINTMENT OF ARBITRATORS 
Section 11 of the Act deals with appointment of arbitrators. According 
to this Section, parties can agree to any procedure for appointment of 
arbitrators. But provisions have been made to ensure timely 
appointments as under: 
 
(a) The parties may agree to a procedure of appointment of arbitrators. 
Otherwise the following procedure shall apply : 
 
(i) Arbitrator could be of any nationality. [Section 11(1)] 
 
(ii) In case of an arbitration with three arbitrators, each party shall appoint 
its own arbitrator, and the two appointed arbitrators shall appoint a third 
arbitrator, who shall be the presiding arbitrator [Section 11(3)]. 
 
(iii) If, within 30 days, the parties fail to appoint their arbitrators, or the two 
appointed arbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator, the arbitrator 
shall be appointed by the Chief Justice or any person or institution 
designated by him at the request of a party. [Section 11(4)] 
 
(iv) Similar procedure is also applicable for appointment of a sole arbitrator. 
If parties fail to agree on the appointment of a sole arbitrator within 30 
days, the appointment shall be done by the Chief Justice or a 
person/institution designated by him. 
 
(b) Similar procedure also applies, when the procedure agreed by the parties is 
not acted upon in time. [Section 11(6)] 
 
(c) Decision on appointment of arbitrators by the Chief Justice or persons/ 
institution designated by him, is final [Section 11(7)]. 
 
(d) Chief Justice or the persons/Institution designated by him would have due 
regard to qualifications of arbitrators agreed between the parties, and 
considerations likely to secure an independent and impartial arbitrator. 
[Section 11(8)] 
 
(e) In case of appointment of a sole or third arbitrator in an international 
commercial arbitration, the Chief Justice of India or a person/Institution 
designed by him, may appoint a person of a nationality, other than that of 
the parties, where the parties are of different nationalities. [Section 11(9)] 
 
(f) The Chief Justice can make any Scheme, he considers appropriate for 
appointment of arbitrators under Sub-section (4), (5) or (6). 
In a case original agreement was given a go-by and a new procedure for 
appointment of arbitrator was agreed upon by the parties. However, respondent failed 
to appoint an arbitrator according to new method also. Calcutta High Court held that 
the other party can very well approach the court for appointment of an arbitrator 
under Section 11(5) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (Manoranjan Mandal 
and others v. Union of India and others, AIR 1999 Cal. 117). 
EP-GCL-3 
120 
It has been held by the Supreme Court in M/s S.B. P. & Co. v. M/s Patel Engg. 
Ltd., AIR 2006 SC 450 that the power exercised by the Chief Justice of the High 
Court or the Chief Justice of India under Section 11(6) of the 
Act is not an administrative power. It is a Judicial power. 
The power under Section 11(6) of the Act in its entirety, 
could be delegated, by the Chief Justice of the High Court 
only to another Judge of that Court and by the Chief Justice 
of India to another Judge of the Supreme Court. Designation 
of a District Judge as the authority under Section 11(6) of 
the Act by the Chief Justice of the High Court is not warranted on the Scheme 
of the Act. 
The mode of appointment of arbitrator may not always work very smoothly in 
actual practice. But this may provide further opportunities for the organisations like 
Indian Council of Arbitration, International Centre for Alternate Dispute Resolution 
etc. Under the Act, an arbitrator before accepting his appointment is required to 
disclose to the parties in writing about such matters which may create doubts about 
his impartiality or independence. Where such doubts exist, his appointment can be 
challenged. Similarly, where the arbitrator does not possess the required or the 
agreed qualification for the appointment, his appointment can be challenged as per 
Sections 12 and 13 of the Act. 
Number of arbitrators 
Section 10 of the Act provides that, the parties are free to determine the number 
of arbitrators, provided that such number shall not be an even number. If they fail to 
determine the number of arbitrators, the arbitral tribunal shall consist of a sole 
arbitrator. 
There is nothing in Section 7 to indicate the requirement of the number of 
arbitrators as a part of the arbitration agreement. Thus, the validity of an arbitration 
agreement would not depend on the number of arbitrators specified therein. The 
number of arbitrators is dealt with separately in Section 10 which is a part of the 
machinery provision for the working of the arbitration agreement. It is therefore, clear 
that an arbitration agreement specifying an even number of arbitrators could not be a 
ground to render the arbitration agreement invalid under the Act (MMTC Ltd. v. 
Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd., (1996) 8 Scale 305). 
Grounds for challenge 
The appointment of arbitrators made under Section 11 of the Act, can be 
challenged on the grounds as specified in Section 12 of the Act. For that purpose, 
Section 13 contains the procedure. According to Section 12 of the Act when a person 
is approached in connection with his possible appointment as an arbitrator, he shall 
disclose in writing any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his 
independence or impartiality. Some examples of such circumstances may be blood 
relationship or pecuniary relationship with either party to the dispute. Moreover, an 
arbitrator, from the time of his appointment and throughout the arbitral proceedings, 
shall without delay, disclose to the parties in writing any circumstances referred to 
above unless they have already been informed of them by him. An arbitrator may be 
challenged by a party only if (1) circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts 
as to his independence or impartiality, or (2) he does not possess the qualifications 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
121 
agreed to by the parties. Sub-section 4 of Section 12 makes it clear that a challenge 
is also permitted, if a party becomes aware of these grounds after an appointment is 
made. 
Challenge procedure 
Section 13 of the Act contains detailed provisions regarding challenge procedure. 
Sub-section (1) provides that subject to provisions of Sub-section (4), the parties are 
free to agree on a procedure for challenging an arbitrator. Sub-Section (4) states that 
if a challenge under any procedure agreed upon by the parties or under the 
procedure under Sub-section (2) is not successful, the arbitral tribunal shall continue 
the arbitral proceedings and make an arbitral award. But at that stage, the 
challenging party has the right to make an application in the Court to set aside the 
award in accordance with Section 34 of the Act. 
Sub-section (2) provides that failing any agreement referred to in Sub-section (1) 
of Section 13, a party who intends to challenge an arbitrator shall, within 15 days 
after becoming aware of the constitution of the arbitral tribunal or after becoming 
aware of any circumstances referred to in Sub-section (3) of Section 12, send a 
written statement of the reasons for the challenge to the arbitral tribunal. The tribunal 
shall decide on the challenge unless the arbitrator challenged under sub-section (2) 
withdraws from his office or the other party agrees to the challenge. It is also provided 
that where an award is set aside on an application made under Sub-section (5) of 
Section 13 of the Act, the Court may decide as to whether the arbitrator who is 
challenged is entitled to any fees. 
Failure or impossibility to act as an arbitrator 
As per Section 14(1), the mandate of an arbitrator shall terminate, if he becomes 
de jure or de facto unable to perform his functions, or fails to act without undue delay 
due to some other reasons. Mandate is also terminated, if he withdraws from his 
office, or the parties agree to the termination of his mandate. 
Further, if there is a controversy about an arbitrator‘s inability to function or 
occurrence of undue delay, a party may seek intervention of the Court under  
Section 14(2). 
However, withdrawal by arbitrator on his own or by agreement between the 
parties does not constitute acceptance of the grounds of challenge. 
It is considered that the procedure for challenge to the appointment of an 
arbitrator need not be a matter of agreement by parties. The procedure in Section 13 
should apply in all cases. 
Substitution of Arbitrator 
 
(1) In addition to the circumstances referred to in Section 13 or Section 14, the 
mandate of an arbitrator shall terminate— 
 
(a) where he withdraws from office for any reasons; or 
 
(b) by or pursuant to agreement of the parties. 
 
(2) Where the mandate of an arbitrator terminates, a substitute arbitrator shall 
be appointed according to the rules that were applicable to such 
appointment being replaced. 
EP-GCL-3 
122 
 
(3) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, where an arbitrator is replaced 
under Sub-section (2), any hearings previously held may be repeated at the 
discretion of the arbitral tribunal. 
 
(4) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an order or ruling of the arbitral 
tribunal made prior to the replacement of an arbitrator under this Section 
shall not be invalid solely because there has been a change in the 
composition of the arbitral tribunal [Section 15]. 
5. ARBITRAL PROCEEDINGS 
Place and commencement of arbitration 
As per Section 20 of the Act, the parties are free to agree on the place of 
arbitration and if they fail to reach an agreement, the place of arbitration is 
determined by the arbitral tribunal, having regard to the circumstances of the case, 
including the convenience of the parties. Section 20(3) introduces an option by 
providing that the arbitrator/tribunal may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, may 
meet at any place it considers appropriate for consultation among its members, for 
hearing witnesses, experts or the parties, or for inspection of documents, goods or 
other property. Section 31(4) makes it mandatory for the arbitral tribunal to state in 
the arbitral award the date and the place of arbitration as determined in accordance 
with Section 20 and the award is then deemed to have been made at that place. Part-
II of the Act deals with foreign awards and is applicable to those awards made 
outside the territory of India. Hence, place of arbitration has far reaching effect in 
terms of law applicable to arbitration and also enforcement of the arbitral award in 
international commercial arbitration.Place of arbitration in an arbitration other than 
international commercial arbitration i.e. in domestic arbitration, does not pose any 
problem. Parties may agree on the place of arbitration anywhere in India. But in 
international commercial arbitration, place of arbitration has legal implications in 
terms of law applicable to arbitration. In domestic arbitration, the arbitral tribunal has 
to decide the dispute in accordance with the Indian law, but in international 
commercial arbitration, parties have been given freedom to designate law applicable 
to the substance of the dispute and the arbitral tribunal may apply the rules of law 
agreed by the parties. 
The old Act did not explain in clear terms the point of commencement of 
arbitration. This difficulty is removed by Section 21 of the new Act stating that the 
arbitral proceedings commence on the date on which a request for that dispute to be 
referred to arbitration is received by the respondent. No time limit has been 
prescribed under the Act. However, where the arbitrator is guilty of undue delay, his 
proceedings can be put to a stop as per Section 14(1) of the Act. 
Language of arbitration 
Section 22 gives freedom to parties to agree upon the language or languages to 
be used in the arbitral proceedings. The arbitral tribunal, subject to agreement of 
parties, has power to determine the language or languages to be used in the arbitral 
proceedings. Generally, the language of arbitration is English. It being the 
international language, the same is agreed in most of the arbitrations by the parties 
and the arbitral tribunal. The arbitral tribunal may ask for translation of documentary 
evidence into the or languages agreed upon by the parties or determined by the 
arbitral tribunal.

Arbitration procedure 
Sections 23 to 27 stipulate the procedure to be followed in arbitration 
proceedings. Under the old law the practice adopted by the Arbitrator regulated the 
different stages of arbitration. The new law gives a comprehensive guidance 
regarding the procedure such as filing of a claim, submission of difference, 
amendment of claim/deferences etc. Sections 23 and 24 of the Act set out the stages 
of arbitration proceedings in an orderly manner. Section 23 of the Act provides that: 
 
(1) Within the period of time agreed upon by the parties as determined by the 
arbitral tribunal, the claimant shall state the facts supporting his claim, the 
points at issue and the relief or remedy sought, and the respondent shall 
state his defence in respect of these particulars, unless the parties have 
otherwise agreed as to the required elements of those statements. 
 
(2) The parties may submit with their statements all documents they consider to 
be relevant or may add a reference to the documents or other evidence they 
will submit. 
 
(3) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, either party may amend or 
supplement his claim or defence during the course of the arbitral 
proceedings, unless the arbitral tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow 
the amendment or supplement having regard to the delay in making it. 
Section 18 lays down two obligations on the arbitral tribunal i.e. to treat the party 
with equality and to give full opportunity to each party to present his case. Section 18 
which is one of the most significant Sections, constitutes a fundamental principle 
which is applicable to entire proceedings. The principle of equality and full opportunity 
to present the case should be observed by the parties also, when laying down any 
rules of procedure. An agreed procedure which violates the fundamental principle of 
equality and granting of an opportunity of being heard, is null and void and an award 
passed in violation of this principle can be set aside. Section 34(2) provides that an 
award may be set aside if the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the 
agreement of the parties, unless such agreement was in conflict with a provision of 
the law from which parties cannot derogate, or, failing such agreement, was not in 
accordance with law. Hence, an agreement cannot be in conflict with a mandatory 
provision of the law. If procedure agreed by the parties violates the fundamental 
principles, it cannot be enforced by the arbitral tribunal. The principle enshrined in 
Section 18 should be observed during the entire arbitral proceedings. The principle 
EP-GCL-3 
124 
does not entitle a party to adopt delaying tactics to obstruct the proceedings. The 
general principle is, however, subject to other provisions contained in Sections 23, 24 
and 25, wherein the right can be curtailed or limited by the parties or by the arbitral 
tribunal in certain cases. The parties may agree that arbitration be conducted on the 
basis of documents only under Section 23(1). Hence, Section 18 is influenced by 
Sections 23, 24 and 25 and at the same time Section 18 must also influence these 
Sections. The arbitral tribunal has to maintain a balance for smooth conduct of the 
proceedings and has to make the parties feel that the arbitral tribunal is giving them 
full opportunity to present documents, witnesses and arguments. The parties are 
entitled to legal representation by the person of their choice and if disallowed, it could 
be violation of the principle of giving a full opportunity of presenting the case. 
Section 24 of the Act deals with hearings and written proceedings. There is no 
restriction upon the parties to agree for holding oral hearings for presentation of 
evidence and for oral arguments or, alternatively, for conducting the proceedings on 
the basis of documents. Otherwise the arbitral tribunal shall decide whether to hold 
oral hearing for the presentation of evidence or for oral argument, or whether the 
proceedings shall be conducted on the basis of documents and other materials, 
provided that arbitral tribunal shall hold hearings, at an appropriate stage of the 
proceedings, on a request by a party, unless the parties agreed that no oral hearings 
shall be held. 
Sub-section 2 of Section 24 requires that the parties shall be given sufficient 
advance notice of any hearing and of any meeting of the arbitral tribunal for the 
purpose of inspection of documents, goods or other property. Further Section 24 
provides that all documents/statements/other information received from one party 
must be communicated to the other parties. 
Statements of claims and defence 
Within the period of time agreed upon by the parties or determined by the 
tribunal, the claimant has to state the facts in supporting his claim, the points at issue 
and the relief or remedy sought. Similarly, the respondent shall also state his defence 
in respect of these particulars. 
Submission of documents 
Sub-section (2) of Section 23 provides that the parties may submit with their 
statements all documents they consider to be relevant or may add a reference to the 
documents or other evidence which they will submit later on. 
Amendments 
Parties may amend or supplement these statements during the proceedings, 
unless: 
 
(1) Parties have agreed otherwise, or 
 
(2) Arbitral tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow the amendment or 
supplement, due to delay in making it. 
Determination of rules of arbitral procedure 
According to Section 19(1) the arbitral tribunal is neither bound by the Code of 
Civil Procedure 1908, nor by the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. The Code of Civil 
Procedure is the Code of Civil Judicature and provides rules relating to suits, place of 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
125 
suing, summons and discovery, judgement and decree, interest, costs etc. The 
Evidence Act makes the law relating to evidence and applies to all judicial 
proceedings in or before the Court but not to proceedings before any arbitral tribunal. 
The arbitral tribunal is not bound to follow the procedure as followed by a Court. 
However, the arbitral tribunal is to observe fundamental principles envisaged under 
the Code of Civil Procedure and the Evidence Act. The procedure adopted by the 
arbitral tribunal should be according to the principles of natural justice. 
Section 19(2) provides that subject to provisions of the Part I, the parties are free 
to agree on a procedure to be followed by the arbitral tribunal in conducting its 
proceedings. Rules of permanent arbitral Institutions usually deal with procedural 
matters in detail and are generally well tested in practice and are revised after 
consultation with experts to take into account fresh development in the law and 
practice of arbitration. Parties generally incorporate arbitration rules of a particular 
institution by reference to the same in the agreement. The arbitral tribunal does not 
have any discretion where any such rule has been provided for in the agreement 
itself. 
The arbitral tribunal may conduct the proceedings in the manner it considers 
appropriate, but such power is subject to two exceptions mentioned below: 
 
(1) The arbitral tribunal cannot conduct the proceedings in a manner which is in 
violation of the mandatory provisions of the law. 
 
(2) The arbitral tribunal cannot conduct proceedings in a manner which is in 
violation of the procedure agreed by the parties, if any. Where parties have 
agreed on the procedure to be followed by the arbitral tribunal in conducting 
its proceedings the arbitral is bound to follow that procedure. 
There is no mandatory provision in the Act as to how to determine the 
admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of evidence. The parties may agree on 
the rules relating to this important aspect of the matter. However, if there are no 
agreed rules by the parties, the arbitral tribunal has power to determine the 
admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of any evidence and make decision in 
the manner it considers appropriate. Section 19 recognizes the freedom of the parties 
to lay down as to how to conduct the proceedings subject to agreement of the parties. 
Freedom to lay down rules of procedure is, subject to following restrictions 
(mandatory provisions) laid down by law: 
 
(1) Submission of a statement of a claim and defence under Section 23. 
 
(2) The parties should be given sufficient advance notice of any hearing and of 
any meeting of the arbitral tribunal for purposes of inspection of documents, 
goods or other property under Section 24(2). 
 
(3) All statements, documents or other information supplied to or applications 
made to the arbitral tribunal by one party should be communicated to the 
other party and any expert report or evidentiary document on which arbitral 
tribunal may rely in making its decision should be communicated to the 
parties, as per Section 24(3). 
 
(4) The arbitral tribunal, or a party with the approval of the arbitral tribunal, is 
allowed to request the Court in taking evidence under Section 27. 
EP-GCL-3 
126 
 
(5) An award in agreed terms must state that it is an award and should be in 
accordance with Section 30. 
 
(6) An arbitral award must be in writing an signed by the majority of all the 
members of the arbitral tribunal as per Section 31(1). 
 
(7) The arbitral award must state its date and place of arbitration under  
Section 31(4). 
 
(8) A copy of the award duly signed by the arbitral tribunal should be delivered 
to each party under Section 31(5). 
 
(9) The arbitral proceedings are terminated by the final arbitral award or by an 
order of the arbitral award under Section 32(2). 
 (10) The arbitral tribunal has power to correct any computation errors, any 
clerical or typographical errors or any other errors of a similar nature and to 
give interpretation of a specific point or part of the award under Section 33. 
Judges are bound by the Code of Civil Procedure and also by the Rules of the 
Court while conducting proceedings in the Court. There is no corresponding 
arbitration procedure and rules. Permanent arbitral institutions have their own sets of 
arbitration rules, but those rules do not regulate the procedure in detail. The arbitral 
tribunal is master of the procedure of arbitration, subject, of course, to restrictions 
imposed by law, agreement of parties and natural matter for a quick and cheap 
resolution of disputes. 
Power to terminate/continue the proceedings 
Section 25 of the Act provides that subject to agreement between the parties, where, 
without showing sufficient cause, the claimant fails to communicate his statement of 
claim within the agreed period, the arbitration proceedings shall be terminated by the 
arbitrator. Similarly, where the respondent fails to communicate his statement of 
defence within the predetermined period, the arbitrator shall continue the proceedings 
without treating such failure, in itself, as an admission of the claimant‘s allegations. 
Further, when a party fails to appear at an oral hearing or to produce documentary 
evidence in support of its averment, the arbitrator can proceed and pronounce the 
award on the basis of evidence available before it. Thus, the general principles of ex 
party proceedings will apply to arbitration proceedings also. 
Appointment of experts by Arbitral Tribunal 
Section 26(1) of the Act, provides for appointment of experts subject to 
agreement between the parties. Clause (b) of Sub-section (1) of the Section obligates 
the parties to provide the expert access to necessary information and documents. 
The provisions stipulated under Section 26(3) imposes a duty on the expert to 
make available to the parties on their request the various documents etc. on which 
the expert has based his report. 
Decision by majority 
Section 29 of the Act provides for decision by majority where there is more than 
one arbitrator. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
127 
Court assistance 
Provisions are also made under the Act relating to Court assistance in taking 
evidence. Section 27 of the Act provides that the arbitral tribunal, or a party with the 
approval of the arbitral tribunal, may apply to the court for assistance in taking 
evidence. For this purpose the application must specify the names and addresses of 
the parties and the arbitrators, general nature of the claim and the relief sought and 
the evidence to be obtained particularly (1) the name and address of any person to 
be heard as witness or expert witness and a statement of the subject matter of the 
testimony required; (2) the description of any document to be produced or property to 
be inspected. According to Sub-section (3), the Court may execute the request by 
ordering that the evidence be provided directly to the arbitral tribunal. Parties shall be 
subject to the same disadvantage, punishments and penalties by order of the Court, 
as they would incur for the like offences in suits tried by the Court when persons fail 
to attend, or make a default, or refuse to give evidence or guilty of contempt of the 
tribunal during the conduct of the proceedings. 
Jurisdiction of Arbitral Tribunals 
The arbitral tribunal is empowered to rule its own jurisdiction including any 
objections in relation to existence and validity of the arbitration agreement. Secton 16 
of the Act relates to competence of arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction, including 
ruling on any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration 
agreement. For this purpose: 
 
(1) an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an 
agreement independent of other terms of the contract; and 
 
(2) a decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not 
entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause. 
Section 16 also contains in its ambit pleas of non-jurisdiction or excess of 
authority. Sub-section (2) of Section 16 provides that a plea can be raised not later 
than the submission of the statement of defence where the arbitral tribunal does not 
have jurisdiction. It is further provided that a party shall not be precluded from raising 
such a plea merely because he has appointment or participated in the appointment of 
an arbitrator. Likewise, Sub-section (3) of Section 16 provides that a plea that the 
arbitral tribunal is exceeding the scope of its authority, could be raised by the party 
during the arbitral proceedings, if the matter alleged, is beyond the scope of its 
authority. Sub-section (4) of Section 16 gives discretionary power to arbitral tribunal 
to admit a later plea. It provides that the tribunal may, in either of the cases referred 
to in Sub-section (2) or Sub-section (3) admit a later plea if it considers the delay 
justified. The arbitral tribunal shall decide on a plea referred to it in Sub-section (2) or 
Sub-section (3) and where the tribunal takes a decision rejecting the plea, it shall 
continue with the arbitral proceedings and make an arbitral award. [Section 16(5)] 
An application for setting aside the award may be made in the Court by a party 
aggrieved by such an arbitral award. The application should be made in accordance 
with Section 34 of the Act. 
It is important to note that under the Arbitration Act, 1940 if the contract is 
perished the arbitration clause also perished with the contract. But under the Act, 
there is a departure from the old Act in this regard. Under the Act if a contract is 
EP-GCL-3 
128 
declared null or void, it does not mean that arbitration is not valid. In other words, 
under the Act, the clause or an arbitration agreement is to be treated as a clause or 
an agreement and independent from the other terms of the contract and therefore the 
validity of the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is not affected by the 
modification or recession, invalidity or revocation of the contract. 
Interim measures ordered by Arbitral Tribunal 
Interim measures are made in the interest of justice and the jurisdiction of the 
tribunal for interim measures is limited to the subject matter of dispute. Section 17 of 
the Act relates to interim measures ordered by the tribunal whereas Section 9 of the 
Act authorises a court to order interim measures. Section 17 provides that unless the 
parties have specifically agreed, the tribunal may order a party for taking any interim 
measure of protection as the tribunal may consider necessary in respect of subject 
matter of the dispute. For obtaining an order, an application must be made by a party. 
As per Sub-section (2) of Section 17 the tribunal may ask a party to provide 
appropriate security in connection with the protective measures ordered by it under 
sub-section (1) of Section 17. 
Interim measures are temporary and provisional. They are operative till the 
dispute is resolved by an award to protect the interest of a party. 
Arbitral award 
Section 31 of the Act lays down the requirements as to form and contents of an 
arbitration award. An award must be a speaking order i.e. it must state the reasons, 
unless the parties have specifically agreed that reasons need not be given or the 
award is based on agreed terms. The award should state the reasons upon which it is 
based. In other words, unless (a) the parties have agreed that no reasons are to be 
given or (b) the award is an arbitral award on agreed terms under Section 30 of the 
Act, the award should state the reasons in support of determination of the 
liability/non-liability. The legislature has not accepted the ratio of Constitution Bench 
in the Chokhamal Contractor‘s case (AIR 1990 SC 1426), that the award, being in the 
private law field, need not be a speaking award even where the award relates to the 
contract of private parties or between person and the Government or public sector 
undertakings (Tamil Nadu Electricity Board v. Bridge Tunnel Constructions & Others, 
AIR 1997 SC 1376). Date and Place are to be mentioned in the award in accordance 
with Section 20 of the Act and the award should be deemed to have been made at 
that place. 
Section 31(1) requires that the award shall be made in writing and shall be 
signed by the members of the arbitral tribunal. According to Sub-section (5) of 
Section 31 of the Act, a signed copy of the same is to be delivered to each party. 
Interim award 
The arbitral tribunal can make an interim award on any matter with respect to 
which it may make a final award (See also Section 2(1)(c) of the Act). 
Award of interest 
Section 31(7) of the Act provides as under: 
 
(a) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, where and in sofar as an arbitral 
award is for the payment of money, the arbitral tribunal may include in the 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
129 
? 
sum for which the award is made, interest at such rate as it deems 
reasonable, on the whole or any part of the money, for the whole or any part 
of the period between the date on which the cause of action arose and the 
date on which the award is made. 
 
(b) A sum directed to be paid by an arbitral award shall, unless the award 
otherwise directs, carry interest at the rate of eighteen per cent per annum 
from the date of the award to the date of payment. 
Finality of arbitral awards 
Section 35 of the Act corresponds to the Article 35(1) of UNCITRAL Model Law. 
The Section 35 of the Act provides that subject to the provisions of Part-I of the Act 
the award shall be final and binding on the parties and persons claiming under it. In 
other words an arbitral award is final and binding on the parties and the persons 
claiming under the same, subject to time limit prescribed under Sections 33 and 34 of 
the Act.

Correction and interpretation of an award 
Section 33 of the Act deals with correction and interpretation of an award, or 
additional award. 
The award may be corrected by the arbitral tribunal within 30 days of the receipt 
of the award. For that purpose, a party, with notice to the other party, may request the 
tribunal to correct any computation errors, any clerical or typographical errors or any 
other errors of a similar nature occurring in the award. If so agreed by the parties, a 
party, with notice to the other party, may request the arbitral tribunal to give an 
interpretation of a specific point or part of the award. Sub-section (1) of Section 33 
also provides that the parties may agree upon a period of time other than 30 days for 
the request. 
If the tribunal finds that the request is reasonable, it shall make a correction or 
give an interpretation, within 30 days of the receipt of the request. However, the 
tribunal may extend if necessary, the period of time within which it shall make a 
correction, give an interpretation of arbitral award under the provisions of Sub-section 
(6) of Section 33 of the Act. The interpretation shall be treated as part of the award. 
Likewise, the arbitral tribunal may also correct any errors, on its own within 30 days 
from the date of the award. That time cannot be extended by the tribunal. 
EP-GCL-3

Additional award 
Sub-section (4) of Section 33 contains provisions for making additional award. It 
provides that unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a party with notice to the other 
party, may request the tribunal to make an additional award as to claims presented in 
the arbitral proceedings but omitted from the arbitral award. Such request may be 
made within 30 days from the receipt of the arbitral award. If the arbitral tribunal 
considers the above request reasonable, the tribunal shall make the additional 
arbitral award within 60 days of the request. The time period of 60 days may be 
extended by the tribunal if necessary. 
The provisions of Section 31 of the Act shall be applicable to a correction or an 
interpretation of the award or to an additional award. 
Enforcement of award 
Section 36 of the Act provides that if the time for making an application to set 
aside the award has expired or the application has been refused, the award shall be 
enforced under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in the same manner as it were a 
decree of the Court. 
6. PROVISIONS REGARDING SETTING ASIDE AN AWARD 
The parties can approach the Court for setting aside the Award. Section 2(e) 
specifically provides that "Court" means the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction 
in a district, including High Court and excludes any Civil Court of grade inferior to 
such principal Civil Court or any Court of small causes. 
An application may be made in accordance with Sub-section (2) and 
Sub-section (3) of Section 34 of the Act for setting aside an arbitral 
award. 
Sub-section (2) of Section 34, stipulates the following grounds on which the 
award may be challenged before the Court: 
 
(i) incapacity of a party; 
 
(ii) invalidity of the arbitration agreement; 
 
(iii) party applying was not given proper notice of the apointement of the 
arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present 
his case; 
 
(iv) award not in accordance with the terms of submission to arbitration in regard 
to the dispute; 
 
(v) arbitral tribunal not properly constituted or the arbitral procedure was not in 
accordance with the agreement of the parties; 
 
(vi) subject matter of the dispute not capable of settlement by arbitration under 
the law for the time being in force; 
 (vii) award being in conflict with ‗the public policy of India‘. 
Explanation to Sub-section (2)(b) provides that an award would be in conflict with 
public policy if it is induced or affected by fraud or corruption or violates Section 75 or 
Section 81 of the Act relating to confidentiality and admissibility of evidence in other 
proceedings. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
131 
Section 34(3) of the Act prescribes the time limit for making an application for 
setting aside an arbitral award. The application cannot be made after three months 
have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received 
the arbitral award or if a request had been made under Section 33 from the date on 
which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal. It is further provided 
that the period of three months could be extended to a maximum of 30 days by the 
Court but not thereafter if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by 
sufficient cause from making the application within the said period. 
Interim measures by the Court 
Section 9 of the Act relates to interim measures by the Court. These measures 
can be ordered by the Court, on an application by a party before or during the arbitral 
proceedings or at any time before the enforcement of an award. It is based on 
Section 9 of the UNICITRAL Model Law on International Commercial arbitration. The 
intention of the legislators in incorporating Section 9 is quite explicit that the party 
before arbitral proceedings or at any time after making of the award but before its 
enforcement can apply to the Court for interim relief. In Ashok Chawla v. Rakesh 
Gupta, (1996) 2 Arb. L-J. 255, it has been held that in the absence of any prayer 
for substantive relief, the prayer for issuing any directions by way of interim 
measures cannot be entertained. Section 9 contains various interim measures 
such as appointment of a guardian for a minor or a person of unsound mind for the 
purpose of arbitral proceedings or taking measures for protection of assets, issue of 
interim injunctions or appointment of a receiver etc. In a case, petitioner contractor 
entered into an agreement to execute work of building construction. The work could 
not be completed within time as stipulated in the agreement. Therefore, the petitioner 
sought injunction restraining respondents from getting construction work executed by 
other agency or contractors. Delhi High Court held that such building contract can not 
be specifically enforced by in favour of petitioner granting interim relief under Section 
9 of the Act (See BSM Contractors Pvt. Ltd. v. Rajasthan State Bridge and 
Construction Corporation Ltd. and another, AIR 1999 Delhi 117). 
The order of the Court is appealable under Section 37 of the Act of 1996. 
Appeals 
Section 37 of the Act provides that an appeal shall lie from the following orders 
(and from no others) to the court authorised by law to hear appeals from original 
decrees of the court passing the order, namely; 
 
(a) granting or refusing to grant any measures under Section 9; 
 
(b) setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under Section 34. 
An appeal may also lie against the decision of the arbitral tribunal (a) accepting 
the plea referred in Sub-section (2) or Sub-section (3) of Section 16 or (b) under 
Section 17 of the Act relating to granting or refusing to grant any interim measures. 
[Section 37(2)] 
Section 37(3) prohibits making of second appeal from an order passed in appeal 
under Section 37(1) and (2) of the Act but the right to appeal to the Supreme Court is 
always open to a party aggrieved. The Supreme Court may in its discretion grant 
special leave to appeal where the needs of justice demand an interference by the 
highest court of the land. The power conferred upon the Supreme Court is a 
EP-GCL-3 
132 
residuary and extraordinary. However, it shall be exercised by the Court in 
accordance with the well-established judicial principles or the well established norms 
of procedure which have been recognised for long as precedents. 
7. ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN ARBITRAL AWARDS 
Chapters I and II of Part II of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 deal with 
the enforcement of certain foreign awards made under the New York Convention and 
the Geneva Convention, respectively. Sections 44 and 53 of the Act define the 
foreign awards as to mean an arbitral award on differences between persons arising 
out of legal relationship, whether contractual or not, considered commercial under the 
law in force in India made on or after the 11th day of October 1960 in the case of New 
York Convention awards and after the 28th day of July 1924 in the case of Geneva 
Convention awards. 
8. AWARDS MADE UNDER NEW YORK CONVENTION OR GENEVA 
CONVENTION 
Any foreign award whether made under New York Convention or Geneva 
Convention, which would be enforceable under the Act have been treated as binding 
for all purposes on the persons as between whom it was made, and may accordingly 
be relied on by any of those persons by way of defence, set off or otherwise in any 
legal proceedings in India. 
Conditions for Enforcement of Foreign Awards 
Section 57 of the Act enumerates the conditions for enforcement of foreign 
awards and provides that the party, against whom the award is invoked, may use any 
of the following grounds as defence before the Court for the purpose of refusal of 
enforcement of the foreign awards, namely: 
 
(i) the parties were under some incapacity under the law applicable to them or 
the arbitration agreement is not valid under that law; or 
 
(ii) the party against whom the award is invoked was not given proper notice of 
the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was 
otherwise unable to present his case; or 
 
(iii) the award deals with a difference not falling within the terms of submission 
to arbitration. However, if the award can be separated, the decision on the 
matters beyond the scope of the arbitration agreement shall not be enforced; 
or 
 
(iv) the composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in 
accordance with the agreement of the parties or in the law of the country 
where the arbitration took place; or 
 
(v) the award has not yet become binding, or has been set aside or suspended 
by a competent authority of the country in which or under the law of which, 
the award was made; or 
 
(vi) the subject-matter of the difference is not capable of settlement by 
arbitration under the law of India; or 
 (vii) the enforcement of award would be contrary to the public policy of India. In 
this context, it has been clarified that an award is in conflict with the public 
policy of India if the making of the award is induced or effected by fraud or 
corruption. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
133 
The provisions regarding conditions for enforcement of foreign awards made 
under the New York Convention or the Geneva Convention are almost the same. It is 
obligatory on the party applying for the enforcement of a foreign award to produce 
before the Court: 
 
(a) the original award or a duly authenticated copy thereof; 
 
(b) the original agreement for arbitration or a duly-certified copy thereof; and 
 
(c) such evidence as may be necessary to prove that the award is a foreign 
award. 
Where the award or agreement is in a foreign language, the party seeking to 
enforce the award is required to produce a certified translated copy in English. Where 
the Court is satisfied that the foreign award is enforceable, the award shall be 
deemed to be a decree of that Court. 
Appealable Orders 
An appeal to the Court authorized by law to hear appeals from such order, may 
lie on the following two counts: 
 
(i) Where the judicial authority in India has ordered refusing to refer the parties 
to arbitration under Section 45 in case the New York Convention is 
applicable to them under Section 54 in case the Geneva Convention is 
applicable to them. 
 
 The aforesaid sections i.e. Section 45 and Section 54 provide that a judicial 
authority, when seized of an action in a matter in respect of which the parties 
have made an agreement referred in Section 44 or Section 53, shall, at the 
request of one of the parties or any person claiming through or under him, 
refer the parties to arbitration, unless it finds that the said agreement is null 
and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed. 
 
(ii) Where the Court has refused to enforce a foreign award either under 
Section 48 or Section 57 of the Act. 
 
 Section 50(2) prohibits a second appeal from an order passed in appeal. 
However, any right of the parties to appeal to the Supreme Court shall not 
be affected or taken away by virtue of these provisions. 
 
 Both the Chapters of Part II dealing with New York Convention awards and 
Geneva Convention awards contain a similar saving provision which 
provides that nothing in this chapter shall prejudice any rights which any 
person would have had of enforcing in India of any award or of availing 
himself in India of any award if this chapter had not been enacted. 
9. CONCILIATION 
Conciliation is an informal process in which the conciliator (the third 
party) tries to bring the disputants to agreement. He does this by 
lowering tensions, improving communications, interpreting issues, 
providing technical assistance, exploring potential solutions and 
bringing about a negotiated settlement. Mediation is a structured process in which the 
mediator assists the disputants to reach a negotiated settlement of their differences. 
Mediation is usually a voluntary process that results in a signed agreement which 
EP-GCL-3 
134 
defines the future behaviour of the parties. The mediator uses a variety of skills and 
techniques to help the parties reach the settlement, but is not empowered to render a 
decision. 
Basically, these processes can be successful only if the personality of the 
conciliator or the mediator is such that he is able to induce the parties to come to a 
settlement. The Act gives a formal recognition to conciliation in India. Conciliation 
forces earlier and greater hold of the case. It can succeed only if the parties are 
willing to re-adjust. According to current thinking conciliation is not an alternative to 
arbitration or litigation, but rather complements arbitration or litigation. 
Differences between Arbitration and Conciliation 
Arbitration and conciliation differ in some major ways: 
 
— In arbitration, the decision is known as arbitral award and is signed by the 
arbitral tribunal members; while under conciliation, it is known as 
settlement and is signed by the parties concerned. 
 
— In arbitration, parties cannot appoint even number of arbitrators; while in 
conciliation, the number of conciliators can be even. 
Arbitrators can be appointed even before the dispute arises; while a conciliator is 
appointed only after the dispute has arisen. 
Provisions relating to conciliation 
Under the old law, there are no special provisions to deal with the award based 
on compromise. As against, the new law facilitates the arbitrator to promote efforts to 
arrive at settlement of dispute through conciliation. 
Part III of the Act contains following provisions in this regard. 
Application and scope of conciliation 
(1) Save as otherwise provided by any law for the time being in force and unless 
the parties have otherwise agreed, this Part shall apply to conciliation of disputes 
arising out of legal relationship, whether contractural or not and to all proceedings 
relating thereto. 
(2) This Part shall not apply where by virtue of any law for the time being in force 
certain disputes may not be submitted to conciliation. (Section 61) 
Commencement of conciliation proceedings 
(1) The party initiating conciliation shall send to the other party a written 
invitation to conciliate under this Part, briefly identifying the subject of the dispute. 
(2) Conciliation proceedings shall commence when the other party accepts in 
writing the invitation to conciliate. 
(3) If the other party rejects the invitation there will be no conciliation 
proceedings. 
(4) If the party initiating conciliation does not receive a reply within thirty days 
from the date on which he sends the invitation, or within such other period of time as 
specified in the invitation he may elect to treat this as a rejection of the invitation to 
conciliate and if he so elects, he shall inform in writing the other party accordingly. 
(Section 62) 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
135 
Number of conciliators 
(1) There shall be one conciliator unless the parties agree that there shall be two 
or three conciliators. 
(2) Where there is more than one conciliator, they ought, as a general rule, to act 
jointly. (Section 63) 
Appointment of Conciliators 
(1) Subject to Sub-section (2): 
 
(a) in conciliation proceedings with one conciliator, the parties may agree on 
the name of a sole conciliator; 
 
(b) in conciliation proceedings with two conciliators, each party may appoint 
one conciliator; 
 
(c) in conciliation proceedings with three conciliators, each party may appoint 
one conciliator and the parties may agree on the name of the third 
conciliator who shall act as the presiding conciliator. 
(2) Parties may enlist the assistance of a suitable institution, or person in 
connection with the appointment of conciliators, and in particular: 
 
(a) a party may request such an institution or person to recommend the names 
of suitable individuals to act as conciliator; or 
 
(b) the parties may agree that the appointment of one or more conciliators be 
made directly by such an institution or person: 
Provided that in recommending or appointing individuals to act as conciliator, the 
institution or person shall have regard to such considerations as are likely to secure 
the appointment of an independent and impartial conciliator and, with respect to a 
sole or third conciliator, shall take into account the advisability of appointing a 
conciliator of a nationality other than the nationalities of the parties. (Section 64) 
Submission of statements to conciliator 
(1) The conciliator, upon his appointment, may request each party to submit to 
him a brief written statement describing the general nature of the dispute and the 
points at issue. Each party shall send a copy of such statement to the other party. 
(2) The conciliator may request each party to submit to him a further written 
statement of his position and the facts and grounds in support thereof, supplemented 
by any documents and other evidence that such party deems appropriate. The party 
shall send a copy of such statement, documents and other evidence to the other 
party. 
(3) At any stage of the conciliation proceedings, the conciliator may request a 
party to submit such additional information as he deems appropriate. (Section 65) 
Explanation: In this Section and all the following Sections of this part, the term 
―conciliator‖ applies to a sole conciliator, two or three conciliators as the case may be. 
Conciliator not bound by certain enactments 
The conciliator is not bound by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 or the Indian 
Evidence Act, 1872. (Section 66) 
EP-GCL-3 
136 
Conciliator is vested with wide powers to decide the procedure to be followed by 
him untrammeled by the procedural laws like the Code of Civil Procedure or the 
Indian Evidence Act 1872 (See Haresh Dayaram v. State of Maharashtra, AIR 2000 
SC 2285). 
Role of conciliator 
(1) The conciliator shall assist the parties in an independent and impartial manner 
in their attempt to reach an amicable settlement of their dispute. 
(2) The conciliator shall be guided by principles of objectivity, fairness and 
justice, giving consideration to, among other things, the rights and obligations of the 
parties, the usages of the trade concerned and the circumstances surrounding the 
dispute, including any previous business practices between the parties. 
(3) The conciliator may conduct the conciliation proceedings in such a manner as 
he considers appropriate, taking into account the circumstances of the case, the 
wishes the parties may express, including any request by a party that the conciliator 
hear oral statements, and the need for a speedy settlement of the dispute. 
(4) The conciliator may, at any stage of the conciliation proceedings, make 
proposals for a settlement of the dispute. Such proposals need not be in writing and 
need not be accompanied by a statement of the reasons therefor. (Section 67) 
Administrative assistance 
In order to facilitate the conduct of the conciliation proceedings, the parties, or the 
conciliator with the consent of the parties, may arrange for administrative assistance 
by a suitable institution or person. (Section 68) 
Communication between conciliator and parties 
(1) The conciliator may invite the parties to meet him or may communicate with 
them orally or in writing. He may meet or communicate with the parties together or 
with each of them separately. 
(2) Unless the parties have agreed upon the place where meetings with the 
conciliator are to be held, such place shall be determined by the conciliator, after 
consultation with the parties, having regard to the circumstances of the conciliation 
proceedings. (Section 69) 
Disclosure of Information 
When the conciliator receives factual information concerning the dispute from a 
party, he shall disclose the substance of that information to the other party in order 
that the other party may have the opportunity to present any explanation which he 
considers appropriate: 
Provided that when a party gives any information to the conciliator subject to a 
specific condition that it be kept confidential, the conciliator shall not disclose that 
information to the other party. (Section 70) 
Co-operation of parties with Conciliator 
The parties shall in good faith co-operate with the conciliator and, in particular, 
shall endeavour to comply with requests by the conciliator to submit written materials, 
provide evidence and attend meetings. (Section 71) 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
137 
Suggestions by parties for settlement of dispute 
Each party may, on his own initiative or at the invitation of the conciliator, submit 
to the conciliator suggestions for the settlement of the dispute. (Section 72) 
Settlement agreement 
(1) When it appears to the conciliator that there exists elements of a settlement 
which may be acceptable to the parties, he shall formulate the terms of a possible 
settlement and submit them to the parties for their observations. After receiving the 
observations of the parties, the conciliator may reformulate the terms of a possible 
settlement in the light of such observations.  
(2) If the parties reach agreement on a settlement of the dispute, they may draw 
up and sign a written settlement agreement. If requested by the parties, the 
conciliator may draw up, and assist in drawing up, the settlement agreement. 
(3) When the parties sign the settlement agreement, it shall be final and binding 
on the parties and persons claiming under them respectively. 
(4) The conciliator shall authenticate the settlement agreement and furnish a 
copy thereof to each of the parties. (Section 73) 
Status and effect of settlement agreement 
The settlement agreement shall have the same status and effect as if it is an 
arbitral award on agreed terms on the substance of the dispute rendered by an 
arbitral tribunal under Section 30. (Section 74) 
Under Sub-section (3) of Section 73, a successful conciliation proceedings 
comes to an end only when the settlement agreement signed by the parties comes 
into existence. It is such an agreement which has the status and effect of legal 
sanctity of an arbitral award under Section 74 of the Act (Haresh Dayaram Thakur v. 
State of Maharashtra, AIR 2000 SC 2281). 
Confidentiality 
Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, 
the conciliator and the parties shall keep confidential all matters relating to the 
conciliation proceedings. Confidentiality shall extend also to the settlement 
agreement, except where its disclosure is necessary for purposes of implementation 
and enforcement. (Section 75) 
Termination of conciliation proceedings 
The conciliation proceedings shall be terminated: 
 
(a) by the signing of the settlement agreement by the parties on the date of the 
agreement; or 
 
(b) by a written declaration of the conciliator, after consultation with the parties,

effect that the conciliation proceedings are terminated, on the date of the 
declaration; or 
EP-GCL-3 
138 
 
(d) by a written declaration of a party to the other party and the conciliator, if 
appointed, to the effect that the conciliation proceedings are terminated, on 
the date of the declaration. (Section 76) 
Resort to arbitral or judicial proceedings 
The parties shall not initiate, during the conciliation proceedings, any arbitral or 
judicial proceedings in respect of a dispute that is the subject matter of the 
conciliation proceedings except that a party may initiate arbitral or judicial 
proceedings where, in his opinion, such proceedings are necessary for preserving his 
rights. (Section 77) 
Costs 
(1) Upon termination of the conciliation proceedings, the conciliator shall fix the 
costs of the conciliation and give written notice thereof to the parties. 
(2) For the purpose of Sub-section (1), ―costs‖ means reasonable costs relating 
to: 
 
(a) the fee and expenses of the conciliator and witnesses requested by the 
conciliator with the consent of the parties; 
 
(b) any expert advice requested by the conciliator with the consent of the 
parties; 
 
(c) any assistance provided pursuant to clause (b) of Sub-section (2) of  
Section 64 and Section 68;

10. ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) 
There is a growing awareness that courts will not be in a position to bear the 
entire burden of justice system. A very large number of disputes lend themselves to 
resolution by alternative modes such as arbitration, mediation, conciliation, 
negotiation, etc. The ADR processes provide procedural flexibility save valuable time 
and money and avoid the stress of a conventional trial. 
At present, ADR services are offered in India in very rudimentary form. There is, 
therefore, an urgent need to establish and promote ADR services for resolution of 
EP-GCL-3 
140 
both domestic and international disputes in India. These services need to be 
nourished 
on 
sound 
conceptions, 
expertise 
in 
their 
implementation 
and 
comprehensive and modern facilities. 
The International Centre for Alternative Dispute Resolution (ICADR) is a unique 
centre in this part of the world that makes provision for promoting teaching and 
research in the field of ADR as also for offering ADR services to parties not only in 
India but also to parties all over the world. The ICADR is a Society registered under 
Societies Registration Act, 1860, it is an independent non-profit making organisation. 
It maintains panels of independent experts in the implementation of ADR processes. 
Areas in which ADR works 
Almost all disputes including commercial, civil, labour and family disputes, in 
respect of which the parties are entitled to conclude a settlement, can be settled by 
an ADR procedure. ADR techniques have been proven to work in the business 
environment, especially in respect of disputes involving joint ventures, construction 
projects, partnership differences, intellectual property, personal injury, product 
liability, professional liability, real estate, securities, contract interpretation and 
performance and insurance coverage. 
III.  LAW RELATING TO TORTS 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
The word ‗tort‘ is a French equivalent of English word ‗wrong‘. The word tort is 
derived from Latin language from the word Tortum. Thus, simply stated ‗tort‘ means 
wrong. But every wrong or wrongful act is not a tort. Tort is really a kind of civil wrong 
as opposed to criminal wrong. Wrongs, in law, are either public or private. 
Broadly speaking, public wrongs are the violations of ‗public law and hence 
amount to be offences against the State, while private wrongs are the breaches of 
private law, i.e., wrongs against individuals. Public wrongs or crimes are those 
wrongs which are made punishable under the penal law which belong to the public 
law group. 
Section 2(m) of the Limitation Act, 1963, states: ―Tort means a civil wrong which 
is not exclusively a breach of contract or breach of trust.‖ 
Salmond defines it as ‖a civil wrong for which the remedy is a common law action 
for unliquidated damages and which is not exclusively the breach of a contract or the 
breach of a trust or other merely equitable obligation.‖ 
Fraser describes it as ―an infringement of a right in rem of a private individual 
giving a right of compensation at the suit of the injured party.‖ 
Winfield says : ―Tortious liability arises from the breach of duty, primarily fixed by 
law; this duty is towards persons generally and its breach is redressable by an action 
for unliquidated damages‖. 
Two important elements can be derived from all these definitions, namely: (i) that 
a tort is a species of civil injury of wrong as opposed to a criminal wrong, and (ii) that 
every civil wrong is not a tort. Accordingly, it is now possible to distinguish tort from a 
crime and from a contract, a trust and a quasi-contract. The distinction between civil 
and criminal wrongs depends on the nature of the appropriate remedy provided by 
law. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
141 
2. GENERAL CONDITIONS OF LIABILITY FOR A TORT 
As stated earlier, there is no fixed catalogue of circumstances, which along and 
for all time mark the limit of what are torts. Certain situations have been held to be 
torts and will continue to be so in the absence of statutory repeal, and others have 
been held not to be torts. However, certain general conditions for tortuous liability can 
be laid down. 
In general, a tort consists of some act or omission done by the defendant 
(tortfeasor) whereby he has without just cause or excuse caused some harm to 
plaintiff. To constitute a tort, there must be: 
 
(i) a wrongful act or omission of the defendant; 
 
(ii) the wrongful act must result in causing legal damage to another; and 
 
(iii) the wrongful act must be of such a nature as to give rise to a legal remedy. 
(i) Wrongful act: The act complained of, should under the circumstances, be 
legally wrongful as regards the party complaining. In other words, it should 
prejudicially affect any of the above mentioned interests, and protected by law. Thus, 
every person whose legal rights, e.g., right of reputation, right of bodily safety and 
freedom, and right to property are violated without legal excuse, has a right of action 
against the person who violated them, whether loss results from such violation or not. 
(ii) Legal damages: it is not every damage that is a damage in the eye of the law. 
It must be a damage which the law recognizes as such. In other words, there should 
be legal injury or invasion of the legal right. In the absence of an infringement of a 
legal right, an action does not lie. Also, where there is infringement of a legal right, an 
action lies even though no damage may have been caused.  
As was stated in Ashby v. White, (1703) 2 Ld. Raym. 938 legal 
damage is neither identical with actual damage nor is it 
necessarily pecuniary. Two maxims, namely : (i) Damnum sine 
injuria, and (ii) injuria sine damnum, explain this proposition. 
Damnum Sine Injuria 
Damnum means harm, loss or damage in respect of money, comfort, health, etc. 
Injuria means infringement of a right conferred by law on the plaintiff. The maxim 
means that in a given case, a man may have suffered damage and yet have no 
action in tort, because the damage is not to an interest protected by the law of torts. 
Therefore, causing damage, however substantial to another person is not actionable 
in law unless there is also a violation of a legal right of the plaintiff. Common 
examples are, where the damage results from an act done in the exercise of legal 
rights. Thus, if I own a shop and you open a shop in the neighbourhood, as a 
result of which I lose some customers and my profits fall off, I cannot sue you 
for the lose in profits, because you are exercising your legal right. [Gloucester 
Grammer School case, (1410) Y.B. Hill. 11 Hen, 4, of. 47, pp. 21,36] 
Injuria Sine Damno 
It means injury without damage, i.e., where there is no damage resulted yet it is 
EP-GCL-3 
142 
? 
an injury or wrong in tort, i.e. where there is infringement of a legal right not resulting 
in harm but plaintiff can still sue in tort. 
Some rights or interests are so important that their violation is an actionable tort 
without proof of damage. Thus when there is an invasion of an ―absolute‖ private right 
of an individual, there is an injuria and the plaintiff‘s action will succeed even if there 
is no Damnum or damages. In simple terms, it means that if some one else‘s legal 
rights are infringed upon, it is actionable, even if no damage has resulted to the other 
person.  The leading example is the case of Ashby v White referred to above where a 
person was wrongfully not allowed to vote and even though it has not caused him any 
damage, since his legal right to vote was denied, he was entitled to compensation. 
An absolute right is one, the violation of which is actionable per se, i.e., without the 
proof of any damage. Injuria sine damno covers such cases and action lies when the 
right is violated even though no damage has occurred. Thus the act of trespassing 
upon another‘s land is actionable even though it has not caused the plaintiff even the 
slightest harm. 
(iii) Legal remedy: The third condition of liability for a tort is legal remedy. This 
means that to constitute a tort, the wrongful act must come under the law. The main 
remedy for a tort is an action for unliquidated damages, although some other 
remedies, e.g., injunction, may be obtained in addition to damages or specific 
restitution may be claimed in an action for the detention of a chattel. Self-help is a 
remedy of which the injured party can avail himself without going to a law court. It 
does not apply to all torts and perhaps the best example of these to which it does 
apply is trespass to land. For example, if ―A‖ finds a drunken stranger in his room who 
has no business to be there in it, and is thus a trespass, he (A) is entitled to get rid of 
him, if possible without force but if that be not possible with such force as the 
circumstances of the case may warrant. 
Mens Rea 
How far a guilty mind of persons is required for liability for tort? 
The General principle lies in the maxim ―actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea‖ 
i.e. the act itself creates no guilt in the absence of a guilty mind. It does not mean that 
for the law or Torts, the act must be done with an evil motive, but simply means that 
mind must concur in the Act, the act must be done either with wrongful intention or 
negligence. For example, under criminal law, mens rea must be proved. However, to 
this principle cases of absolute or strict liability are exceptions.

3. KINDS OF TORTIOUS LIABILITY 
The following types of tortuous liability may be noted: 
(A) STRICT OR ABSOLUTE LIABILITY 
In some torts, the defendant is liable even though the harm to the plaintiff 
occurred without intention or negligence on the defendant‘s part. In other words, the 
defendant is held liable without fault. These cases fall under the following categories: 
(i) Liability for Inevitable Accident – Such liability arises in cases where damage 
is done by the escape of dangerous substances brought or kept by anyone upon his 
land. Such cases are where a man is made by law an insurer of other against the 
result of his activities. 
(ii) Liability for Inevitable Mistake – Such cases are where a person interferes 
with the property or reputation of another. 
(iii) Vicarious Liability for Wrongs committed by others – Responsibility in such 
cases is imputed by law on grounds of social policy or expediency. These case 
involve liability of master for the acts of his servant. 
Rule in Rylands v. Fletcher 
The rule in Rylands v. Flethcer (1868) L.R. 3 H.L. 330 is that a man acts at his 
peril and is the insurer of the safety of his neighbour against accidental harm. 
Such duty is absolute because it is independent of 
negligence on the part of the defendant or his servants. It 
was held in that case that: “If a person brings or 
accumulates on his land anything which, if it should escape 
may cause damage to his neighbours, he does so at his 
own peril. If it does not escape and cause damage he is 
responsible, however careful he may have been, and 
whatever precautions he may have taken to prevent damage.” 
The facts of this case were as follows: B, a mill owner employed independent 
contractors, who were apparently competent to construct a reservoir on his land to 
provide water for his mill. There were old disused mining shafts under the site of the 
reservoir which the contractors failed to observe because they were filled with earth. 
The contractors therefore, did not block them. When the water was filled in the 
reservoir, it bursted through the shafts and flooded the plaintiff‘s coal mines on the 
adjoining land. It was found as a fact that B did not know of the shafts and had not 
been negligent, though the independent contractors, had been, B was held liable. 
Blackburn, J., observed; ―We think that the true rule of law is that the person, who for 
his own purposes brings on his lands and collects and keeps there anything likely to 
do mischief if it escapes, must keep it at his peril and if, he does not do so is, prima 
facie answerable for all the damage which is the natural consequence of its escape.‖ 
Later in the case of Read v. Lyons [(1946) 2 All. E.R. 471 (H.L.)], it has been 
explained that two conditions are necessary in order to apply the rule in Ryland v. 
Fletcher, these are: 
(i) Escape: from a place of which the defendant has occupation or over which he 
has a control to a place which is outside his occupation or control or something likely 
to do mischief if it escapes; and 
EP-GCL-3 
144 
(ii) Non-natural use of Land: The defendant is liable if he makes a non-natural 
use of land. 
If either of these conditions is absent, the rule of strict liability will not apply. 
(a) Exceptions to the Rule of Strict Liability 
The following exceptions to the rule of strict liability have been introduced in 
course of time, some of them being inherent in the judgment itself in Ryland v. 
Fletcher: 
 
(i) Damage due to Natural Use of the Land 
 
 In Ryland v. Fletcher water collected in the reservoir in such large quantity, 
was held to be non-natural use of land. Keeping water for ordinary 
domestic purpose is ‗natural use‘. Things not essentially dangerous which 
is not unusual for a person to have on his own land, such as water pipe 
installations in buildings, the working of mines and minerals on land, the 
lighting of fire in a fire-place of a house, and necessary wiring for supplying 
electric light, fall under the category of ―natural use‖ of land. 
 
(ii) Consent of the plaintiff 
 
 Where the plaintiff has consented to the accumulation of the dangerous 
thing on the defendant‘s land, the liability under the rule in Ryland v. 
Flethcher does not arise. Such a consent is implied where the source of 
danger is for the ‗common benefit‘ of both the plaintiff and the defendant. 
 
(iii) Act of Third Party 
 
 If the harm has been caused due to the act of a stranger, who is neither 
defendant‘s servant nor agent nor the defendant has any control over him, 
the defendant will not be liable. Thus, in Box v. Jubh (1879) 4 Ex. D. 76, 
the overflow from the defendant‘s reservoir was caused by the blocking of 
a drain by stranger, the defendant was held not liable. But if the act of the 
stranger, is or can be foreseen by the defendant and the damage can be 
prevented, the defendant must, by due care prevent the damage. Failure 
on his part to avoid such damage will make him liable. 
 
(iv) Statutory Authority 
 
 Sometimes, public bodies storing water, gas, electricity and the like are by 
statute, exempted from liability so long as they have taken reasonable 
care. This is based on the principle that they act in public interest.  
 
 Thus, in Green v. Chelzea Water Works Co. (1894) 70 L.T. 547 the 
defendant company had a statutory duty to maintain continuous 
supply of water. A main belonging to the company burst without any 
fault on its part as a consequence of which plaintiff’s premises were 
flooded with water. It was held that the company was not liable as the 
company was engaged in performing a statutory duty. 
 
(v) Act of God 
 
 If an escape is caused, through natural causes and without human 
intervention circumstances which no human foresight can provide against 
and of which human prudence is not bound to recognize the possibility, 
there is then said to exist the defence of Act of God. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
145 
? 
 
(vi) Escape due to plaintiff‘s own Default 
 
 Damage by escape due to the plaintiff‘s own default was considered to be 
good defence in Rylands v. Fletcher itself. Also, if the plaintiff suffers 
damage by his own intrusion into the defendant‘s property, he cannot 
complain for the damage so caused. 
Applicability of the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher in cases of enterprises engaged in a 
hazardous or inherently dangerous industry 
The Supreme Court has discussed the applicability of the rule of Reylands v. 
Fletcher in the case of M.C. Mehta v. Union of India and Others (1987) 1. Comp. L.J. 
p. 99 S.C. while determining the principles on which the liability of an enterprise 
engaged in a hazardous or inherently dangerous industry depended if an accident 
occurred in such industry. 
―We have to evolve new principle and lay down new norms which would 
adequately deal with the new problems which arise in a highly industrialized 
economy. We cannot allow our judicial thinking to be constricted by reference to 
the law as it prevails in England or for the matter of that, in any other foreign 
country‖.  
On the question of the nature of liability for a hazardous enterprise the court while 
noting that the above rule as developed in England recognizes certain limitations and 
responsibilities recorded it‘s final view as follows: 
―We are of the view that an enterprise which is engaged in a hazardous or 
inherently dangerous industry which poses a potential threat to the health and 
safety of the persons working in the factory and residing in the surrounding 
areas, owes an absolute and non-delegable duty to the community to ensure that 
no harm results to anyone on account of hazardous or inherently dangerous 
nature of the activity which it has undertaken. The enterprise must be held to be 
under an obligation to provide that the hazardous or inherently dangerous activity 
in which it is engaged, must be conducted with the highest standards of safety; 
and if any harm results on account of such activity, the enterprise must be 
absolutely liable to compensate for such harm; and it should be no answer to the 
enterprise to say that it had taken all reasonable care and that the harm occurred 
without negligence on its part.‖ 
Thus, while imposing absolute liability for manufacture of hazardous substances, 
the Supreme Court intended that the requirement of non-natural use or the aspect of 
escape of a dangerous substance, commonly regarded as essential for liability under 
Rylands v. Fletcher, need not be proved in India.

Which of the following are different kinds of strict or absolute liability? 
 
(a) Liability for inevitable accident 
 
(b) Liability for evitable accident 
 
(c) Liability for inevitable mistake 
 
(d) Vicarious liability for wrongs committed by others. 
Correct answer: (a), (c) and (d) 
EP-GCL-3 
146 
(B) VICARIOUS LIABILITY 
Normally, the tortfeasor is liable for his tort. But in some cases a person may be 
held liable for the tort committed by another. A master is vicariously liable for the tort 
of his servant, principal for the tort of his agent and partners for the tort of a partner. 
This is know as vicarious liability in tort. The common examples of such a liability are: 
(a) Principal and Agent [Specific authority] 
Qui facit per alium facit per se – he who acts through another is acting himself, so 
that the act of the agent is the act of the principal. When an agent commits a tort in 
the ordinary course of his duties as an agent, the principal is liable for the same. In 
Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Co. (1912) A.C. 716, the managing clerk of a firm of 
solicitors, while acting in the ordinary course of business committed fraud, 
against a lady client by fraudulently inducing her to sign documents 
transferring her property to him. He had done so without the knowledge of his 
principal who was liable because the fraud was committed in the course of 
employment. 
(b) Partners 
For the tort committed by a partner in the ordinary course of the business of the 
firm, all the other partners are liable therefore to the same extent as the guilty partner. 
The liability of the partners is joint and several. In Hamlyn v. Houston & Co. (1903) 
1 K.B. 81, one of the two partners bribed the plaintiff’s clerk and induced him to 
divulge secrets relating to his employer’s business. It was held that both the 
partners were liable for the tort committed by only one of them. 
(c) Master and Servant [Authority by relation] 
A master is liable for the tort committed by his servant while acting in the course 
of his employment. The servant, of course, is also liable; their liability is joint and 
several. 
In such cases (1) liability of a person is independent of his own wrongful intention 
or negligence (2) liability is joint as well several (3) In case of vicarious liability the 
liability arises because of the relationship between the principal and the wrongdoer 
but in case of absolute or strict liability the liability arises out of the wrong itself. 
A master is liable not only for the acts which have been committed by the 
servant, but also for acts done by him which are not specifically authorized, in the 
course of his employment. The basis of the rule has been variously stated: on the 
maxim Respondeat Superior (Let the principal be liable) or on the maxim Qui facit per 
alium facit per se (he who does an act through another is deemed to do it himself). 
The master is liable even though the servant acted against the express 
instructions, for the benefit of his master, so long as the servant acted in the course 
of employment. 
(d) Employer and Independent Contractor 
It is to be remembered that an employer is vicariously liable for the torts of his 
servants committed in the course of their employment, but he is not liable for the torts 
of those who are his independent contractors. 
A servant is a person who is employed by another (the employer) to perform 
services in connection with the affairs of the employer, and over whom the employer 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
147 
has control in the performance of these services. An independent contractor is one 
who works for another but who is not controlled by that other in his conduct in the 
performance of that work. These definitions show that a person is a servant where 
the employer ―retains the control of the actual performance‖ of the work. 
(e) Where Employer is Liable for the acts of Independent Contractor 
The employer is not liable merely because an independent contractor commits a 
tort in the course of his employment; the employer is liable only if he himself is 
deemed to have committed a tort. This may happen in one of the following three 
ways: 
 
(i) When employer authorizes him to commit a tort. 
 
(ii) In torts of strict liability 
 
(iii) Negligence of independent contractor 
(f) Where Employer is not Liable for the acts of an Independent Contractor 
An employer is not liable for the tort of an independent contractor if he has taken 
care in the appointment of the contractor. In Philips v. Britania Hygienic Laundry 
Co. (1923), the owner of lorry was held not liable when a third-party’s vehicle 
was damaged, in consequence of the negligent repair of his lorry by a garage 
proprietor. 
Employers of independent contractors are liable for the ―collateral negligence‖ of 
their contractors in the course of his employment. Where A employed B to fit 
casement windows into certain premises. B‘s servant negligently put a tool on the still 
of the window on which he was working at the time. The wind blew the casement 
open and the tool was knocked off the still on to a passer by. The employer was held 
to be liable, because the harm was caused by the work on a highway and duty lies 
upon the employer to avoid harm. 
(g) Liability for the acts of Servants 
An employer is liable whenever his servant commits a tort in the course of his 
employment. An act is deemed to be done in the course of employment if it is either: 
 
(i) a wrongful act authorized by the employer, or 
 
(ii) a wrongful and unauthorized mode of doing some act authorized by the 
employer. 
So for as the first alternative is concerned there is no difficulty in holding the 
master liable for the tort of his servant. A few examples, however, are necessary to 
explain the working of the rule in the second. These are as follows: 
In Century Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Northern Ireland Road Transport Board (1942) 
A.C. 509, the director of a petrol lorry, while transferring petrol from the lorry to an 
underground tank at a garage, struck a match in order to light a cigarette and then 
threw it, still alight on the floor. An explosion and a fire ensued. The House of Lords 
held his employers liable for the damage caused, for he did the act in the course of 
carrying out his task of delivering petrol; it was an unauthorized way of doing what he 
was employed to do. 
EP-GCL-3 
148 
? 
Similarly, in Bayley v. Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Rly. Co. (1873) 
L.R. 7 C.P. 415, erroneously thinking that the plaintiff was in the wrong train, a porter 
of the defendants forcibly removed him. The defendants were held liable. 
(C) VICARIOUS LIABILITY OF THE STATE 
(a) The Position in England 
At Common Law the Crown could not be sued in tort, either for wrongs actually 
authorized by it or committed by its servants, in the course of their employment. With 
the passing of the Crown Proceeding Act, 1947, the Crown is liable for the torts 
committed by its servants just like a private individual. Thus, in England, the Crown is 
now vicariously liable for the torts of its servants. 
(b) The Position in India 
Unlike the Crown Proceeding Act, 1947 of England, we have no statutory 
provision with respect to the liability of the State in India. 
When a case of Government liability in tort comes before the courts, the question 
is whether the particular Government activity, which gave rise to the tort, was the 
sovereign function or non-sovereign function. If it is a sovereign function, it could 
claim immunity from the tortuous liability, otherwise not. A sovereign function denotes 
the activity of the State which can be done only by the State like defence, police, etc. 
The State is not liable vicariously for any breach by its employees. A non sovereign 
function covers generally the activities of commercial nature or those which can be 
carried out by a private individual like transport, hospitals etc. in which the State is 
equally liable similar to a private person.

(b) Partners 
 
(c) Master and servant  
 
(d) Employer and employed contractor 
Correct answer: (a), (b) and (c) 
 
4. TORTS OR WRONGS TO PERSONAL SAFETY AND FREEDOM 
An action for damages lies in the following kinds of wrongs which are styled as 
injuries to the person of an individual: 
(a) Battery 
Any direct application of force to the person of another individual 
without his consent or lawful justification is a wrong of battery. To 
constitute a tort of battery, therefore, two things are necessary: (i) use 
of force, however, trivial it may be without the plaintiff‘s consent, and 
(ii) without any lawful justification. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
149 
Even though the force used is very trivial and does not cause any harm, the 
wrong is committed. Thus, even to touch a person in anger or without any lawful 
justification is battery. 
(b) Assault 
Assault is any act of the defendant which directly causes the plaintiff 
immediately to apprehend a contact with his person. Thus, when the 
defendant by his act creates an apprehension in the mind of the 
plaintiff that he is going to commit battery against him, the tort of 
assault is committed. The law of assault is substantially the same as that of battery 
except that apprehension of contact, not the contact itself has to be established. 
Usually when there is a battery, there will also be assault, but not for instance, when 
a person is hit from behind. To point a loaded gun at the plaintiff, or to shake fist 
under his nose, or to curse him in a threatening manner, or to aim a blow at him 
which is intercepted, or to surround him with a display of force is to assault him 
clearly if the defendant by his act intends to commit a battery and the plaintiff 
apprehends it, is an assault. 
(c) Bodily Harm 
A willful act (or statement) of defendant, calculated to cause physical harm to the 
plaintiff and in fact causing physical harm to him, is a tort. 
(d) False Imprisonment 
False imprisonment consists in the imposition of a total restraint for 
some period, however short, upon the liberty of another, without 
sufficient lawful justification. It means unauthorized restraint on a 
person‘s body. What happens in false imprisonment is that a person is 
confined within certain limits so that he cannot move about and so his personal liberty 
is infringed. It is a serious violation of a person‘s right and liberty whether being 
confined within the four walls or by being prevented from leaving place where he is. If 
a man is restrained, by a threat of force from leaving his own house or an open field 
there is false imprisonment. 
(e) Malicious Prosecution 
Malicious prosecution consists in instigating judicial proceedings (usually 
criminal) against another, maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause, 
which terminate in favour of that other and which results in damage to his reputation, 
personal freedom or property. 
The following are the essential elements of this tort: 
 
(i) There must have been a prosecution of the plaintiff by the 
defendant. 
 
(ii) There must have been want of reasonable and probable 
cause for that prosecution. 
 
(iii) The defendant must have acted maliciously (i.e. with an improper motive 
and not to further the end of justice). 
 
(iv) The plaintiff must have suffered damages as a result of the prosecution. 
 
(v) The prosecution must have terminated in favour of the plaintiff. 
EP-GCL-3 
150 
To be actionable, the proceedings must have been instigated actually by the 
defendant. If he merely states the fact as he believes them to a policeman or a 
magistrate he is not responsible for any proceedings which might ensue as a result of 
action by such policeman or magistrate on his/her own initiative. 
This is because there is no malice involved in it.  Malicious prosecution thus 
actually refers to the case of initial prosecution with malice and as a remedy for it, the 
other party who had won the case, may institute, under the law of torts, a suit for 
malicious prosecution. 
(f) Nervous Shock 
This branch of law is comparatively of recent origin. It provides relief when a 
person may get physical injury not by an impact, e.g., by stick, bullet or sword but 
merely by the nervous shock through what he has seen or heard. Causing of nervous 
shock itself is not enough to make it an actionable tort, some injury or illness must 
take place as a result of the emotional disturbance, fear or sorrow. 
(g) Defamation 
Defamation is an attack on the reputation of a person. It means that something is 
said or done by a person which affects the reputation of another. It is defined as 
follows: 
―Defamation is the publication of a statement which tends to lower a 
person in the estimation of right thinking members of society 
generally; or which tends to make them shun or avoid that person.‖ 
Defamation may be classified into two heads: Libel and Slander. Libel is a 
representation made in some permanent form, e.g. written words, pictures, caricatures, 
cinema films, effigy, statue and recorded words. In a cinema films both the 
photographic part of it and the speech which is synchronized with it amount to tort. 
Slander is the publication of a defamatory statement in a transient form; 
statement of temporary nature such as spoken words, or gestures. 
Generally, the punishment for libel is more severe than for slander. 
Defamation is tort as well as a crime in India. 
In India both libel and slander are treated as a crime. Section 499 of the Indian 
Penal Code recognizes both libel and slander as an offence. However, torts in 
criminal law are stricter than in law of tort. 
5. REMEDIES IN TORTS 
(1) Judicial Remedies 
Three types of judicial remedies are available to the plaintiff in an action for tort 
namely: (i) Damages or Compensation, (ii) Injunction, and (iii) Specific Restitution of 
Property. 
Extra Judicial Remedies 
In certain cases it is lawful to redress one‘s injuries by means of self help without 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
151 
? 
recourse to the court. These remedies are: 
(a) Self Defence 
It is lawful for any person to use reasonable forces to protect himself, or any 
other person against any unlawful use of force. 
(b) Prevention of Trespass 
An occupier of land or any person with his authority may use reasonable force to 
prevent trespassers entering or to eject them but the force should be reasonable for 
the purpose. 
(c) Re-entry on Land 
A person wrongfully disposed of land may retake possession of land if he can do 
so in a peaceful and reasonable manner. 
(d) Re-caption of Goods 
It is neither a crime nor a tort for a person entitled to possession of a chattel to 
take it either peacefully or by the use of a reasonable force from one who has 
wrongly taken it or wrongfully detained it. 
(e) Abatement of Nuisance 
The occupier of land may lawfully abate (i.e. terminate by his own act), any 
nuisance injuriously affecting it. Thus, he may cut overhanging branches as 
spreading roots from his neighbour‘s trees, but (i) upon giving notice; (ii) by choosing 
the least mischievous method; (iii) avoiding unnecessary damage. 
(f) Distress Damage Feasant 
An occupier may lawfully seize any cattle or any chattel which are unlawfully on 
his land doing damage there and detain them until compensation is paid for the 
damage. The right is known as that of distress damage feasant-to distrain things 
which are doing damage. It is a legal seizure and detention of cattle or chattel till 
compensation is paid for the damage.

IV.  LAW RELATING TO LIMITATION 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
The law relating to limitation is incorporated in the Limitation Act of 1963, which 
prescribes different periods of limitation for suits, petitions or applications. 
EP-GCL-3 
152 
? 
The Act applies to all civil proceedings and some special criminal proceedings 
which can be taken in a Court of law unless its application is excluded by any 
enactment. The Act extends to whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir. 
Limitation Bars Remedy, But Does Not Extinguish Rights 
The Law of limitation bars the remedy in a Court of law only when the 
period of limitation has expired, but it does not extinguish the right that it 
cannot be enforced by judicial process (Bombay Dying & Mfg. Co. Ltd. v. State of 
Bombay, AIR 1958 SC 328). Thus if a claim is satisfied outside the Court of law after 
the expiry of period of limitation, that is not illegal as the right to cause of action 
always remains. Similarly, even if the defence of limitation is not set by the other 
party, the Court cannot accept any suit, appeal or application beyond the period of 
limitation.  
2. COMPUTATION OF THE PERIOD OF LIMITATION FOR DIFFERENT TYPES 
OF SUITS 
The Courts in India are bound by the specific provisions of the Limitation Act and 
are not permitted to move outside the ambit of these provisions. The Act prescribes 
the period of limitation in Articles in Schedule to the Act. In the Articles of the 
Schedule to the Limitation Act, Columns 1, 2, and 3 must be read together to give 
harmonious meaning and construction. 
The Schedule containing the table showing the relevant Articles prescribing 
limitation period for a specified suit and also time from which such period commences 
is given at the end of this Lesson. 
3. BAR OF LIMITATION 
Section 3 of the Act provides that any suit, appeal or application if made beyond 
the prescribed period of limitation, it is the duty of the Court not to proceed with such 
suits irrespective of the fact whether the plea of limitation has been set up in defence 
or not. The provisions of Section 3 are mandatory. The Court can suo motu take note 
of question of limitation. The question whether a suit is barred by limitation should be 
decided on the facts as they stood on the date of presentation of the plaint. It is a vital 
section upon which the whole limitation Act depends for its efficacy. 
The effect of Section 3 is not to deprive the Court of its jurisdiction. Therefore, 
decision of a Court allowing a suit which had been instituted after the period 
prescribed is not vitiated for want of jurisdiction. A decree passed in a time barred suit 
is not a nullity.

Correct answer: (b) 
 
 
EP-GCL-3

4. EXTENSION OF TIME IN CERTAIN CASES 
Doctrine of sufficient cause 
Section 5 allows the extension of prescribed period in certain cases on sufficient 
cause being shown for the delay. This is known as doctrine of ―sufficient cause‖ for 
condonation of delay which is embodied in Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963. 
Section 5 provides that any appeal or any application, other than an application under 
any of the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, may be 
admitted after the prescribed period if the appellant or the applicant satisfies the court 
that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the application 
within such period. 
It is clarified by the explanation appended to the Section 5 that the fact that the 
appellant or applicant was misled by any order, practice or judgement of the High 
Court in ascertaining or computing the prescribed period may be a sufficient cause 
within the meaning of this section. 
Thus, the Court may admit an application or appeal even after the expiry of the 
specified period of limitation if it is satisfied with the applicant or the appellant, as the 
case may be as to sufficient cause for not making it within time. 
The Section is not applicable to applications made under any of the provisions of 
Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and also to suits. The Court has no 
power to admit a time barred suit even if there is a sufficient cause for the delay. It 
applies only to appeals or applications as specified therein. The reason for non-
applicability of the Section to suits is that, the period of limitation allowed in most of the 
suits extends from 3 to 12 years whereas in appeals and application it does not exceed 
6 months. For the applicability of Section 5, the ―prescribed period‖ should be over. The 
prescribed period means any period prescribed by any law for the time being in force. 
The party applying for condonation of delay should satisfy the Court for not 
making an appeal or application within the prescribed period for sufficient cause. The 
term sufficient cause has not been defined in the Limitation Act. It depends on the 
circumstances of each case.  
However, it must be a cause which is beyond the control of the party.  In Ramlal 
v. Rewa Coal Fields Ltd., AIR 1962 SC 361, the Supreme Court held that once the 
period of limitation expires then the appellant has to explain the delay made 
thereafter for day by day and if he is unable to explain the delay even for a single 
day, it would be deemed that the party did not have sufficient cause for delay. 
It is the Court‘s discretion to extend or not to extend the period of limitation even 
after the sufficient cause has been shown and other conditions are also specified. 
However, the Court should exercise its discretion judicially and not arbitrarily. 
What is sufficient cause and what is not may be explained by the 
following Judicial observations: 
 
1. Wrong practice of High Court which misled the appellant or 
his counsel in not filing the appeal should be regarded as sufficient 
cause under Section 5; 
 
2. In certain cases, mistake of counsel may be taken into consideration in 
condonation of delay. But such mistake must be bona fide; 
EP-GCL-3 
154 
 
3. Wrong advice given by advocate can give rise to sufficient cause in certain 
cases; 
 
4. Mistake of law in establishing or exercising the right given by law may be 
considered as sufficient cause. However, ignorance of law is not excuse, nor 
the negligence of the party or the legal adviser constitutes a sufficient cause; 
 
5. Imprisonment of the party or serious illness of the party may be considered 
for condonation of delay; 
 
6. Time taken for obtaining certified copies of the decree of the judgment 
necessary to accompany the appeal or application was considered for 
condoning the delay. 
 
7. Non-availability of the file of the case to the State counsel or Panel lawyer is 
no ground for condonation of inordinate delay (Collector and Authorised 
Chief Settlement Commissioner v. Darshan Singh and others, AIR 1999 Raj. 
84). 
 
8. Ailment of father during which period the defendant was looking after him 
has been held to be a sufficient and genuine cause (Mahendra Yadav v. 
Ratna Devi & others, AIR 2006 (NOC) 339 Pat. 
The test of “sufficient course” is purely an individualistic test.  It is not an 
objective test.  Therefore,  no two cases can be treated alike.  
The statute of limitation has left the concept of sufficient 
cause’ delightfully undefined thereby leaving to the court a 
well-intended discretion to decide  the individual cases 
whether circumstances exist establishing sufficient cause.  
There are no categories of sufficient cause.  The categories 
of sufficient cause are never exhausted.  Each case spells 
out a unique experience to be dealt with by the Court as such. [R B Ramlingam 
v. R B Bhvansewari (2009) 2 SCC 689.] 
The quasi-judicial tribunals, labour courts or executive authorities have no power 
to extend the period under this Section. 
There are no categories of sufficient cause. The categories of 
sufficient cause are never exhausted. Each case spells out a 
unique experience to be dealt with by the court as such. 
Persons under legal disability 
Section 6 is an enabling section to enable persons under disability to exercise 
their legal rights within a certain time. Section 7 supplements Section 6, Section 8 
controls these sections, which serves as an exception to Sections 6 and 7. The 
combined effect of Sections 6 and 8 is that where the prescribed period of limitation 
expires before the cessation of disability, for instance, before the attainment of 
majority, the minor will no doubt be entitled to a fresh period of limitation from the 
attainment of his majority subject to the condition that in no case the period extended 
by Section 6 shall by virtue of Section 8 exceeds three years from cessation of 
disability, i.e. attainment of majority. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
155 
? 
Sections 6, 7 and 8 must be read together. Section 8 imposes a limitation on 
concession provided under Sections 6 and 7 to a person under disability up to a 
maximum of three years after the cessation of disability. The Section applies to all 
suits except suits to enforce rights of pre-emption. 
The period of three years under Section 6 of this Act has to be counted, not from 
the date of attainment of majority by the person under disability, but from the date of 
cessation of minority or disability. 
Both Sections 6 and 7 go together. Section 7 is an extension of Section 6, where 
the point of time at which the existence of disability is to be recognized i.e. ―the time 
from which the period of limitation is to be reckoned‖. 
Section 7 is only an application of the principle in Section 6 to a joint-right 
inherited by a group of persons wherein some or all of whom are under the disability. 
The disability of all except one does not prevent the running of time, if the discharge 
can be given without the concurrence of the other. Otherwise the time will run only 
when the disability is removed. 
To apply Section 7, disability must exist when the right to apply accrued, i.e., at 
the time from which period of limitation is to be reckoned. 
In other words, Section 8 provides that in those cases where the application of 
Section 6 or 7 of the Act results in an extension of the period prescribed by Schedule,

5. CONTINUOUS RUNNING OF TIME 
According to Section 9 of the Act where once time has begun to 
run, no subsequent disability or inability to institute a suit or make an 
application can stop it provided that where letters of administration to 
the estate of a creditor have been granted to his debtor, the running of 
the period of limitation for a suit to recover debt shall be suspended 
while the administration continues. 
The rule of this Section is based on the English dictum. ―Time when once it has 
commenced to run in any case will not cease to be so by reason of any subsequent 
event‖. Thus, when any of the statutes of limitation is begun to run, no subsequent 
disability or inability will stop this running. 
EP-GCL-3 
156 
The applicability of this Section is limited to suits and applications only and does 
not apply to appeals unless the case fell within any of the exceptions provided in the 
Act itself. 
For the applicability of Section 9 it is essential that the cause of action or the right 
to move the application must continue to exist and subsisting on the date on which a 
particular application is made. If a right itself had been taken away by some 
subsequent event, no question of bar of limitation will arise as the starting point of 
limitation for that particular application will be deemed not to have been commenced. 
Thus, time runs when the cause of action accrues. True test to determine when a 
cause of action has accrued is to ascertain the time, when plaintiff could have 
maintained his action to a successful result first if there is an infringement of a right at 
a particular time, the whole cause of action will be said to have arisen then and there. 
Section 9 contemplates only cases where the cause of action continues to exist. 
Section 10 excludes suits against trustees and their representatives from the purview 
of the Act. In order to invoke the application of Section 10 the property must be 
vested in a trustee or trustees for a specific-purpose. 
6. COMPUTATION OF PERIOD OF LIMITATION 
(i) Exclusion of certain days or exclusion of time in legal proceedings 
While computing Period of Limitation certain day/days are to be excluded. 
Part III of the Act containing Sections 12 to 24 deals with computation of period of 
limitation and Section 12 prescribes the time which shall be excluded in computing 
the time of limitation in legal proceedings. 
Computation of period of limitation for a suit, appeal or application: According to 
Section 12(1), the day which is to be excluded in computing period of limitation is the 
day from which the period of limitation is to be reckoned. In case of any suit, appeal 
or application, the period of limitation is to be computed exclusive of the day on which 
the time begins to run. 
Computation of period of limitation for an appeal or an application for leave to 
appeal or for revision or for review of a judgement. The day on which the judgement 
complained of was pronounced and the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the 
decree, sentence or order appealed from or sought to be revised or reviewed shall be 
excluded [Section 12(2)]. 
Computation of period for an application made for leave to appeal from a decree 
or order. The time requisite for obtaining a copy of the judgement shall also be 
excluded [Section 12(3)]. 
Computation of Limitation period for an application to set aside an award: The 
time required for obtaining a copy of the award shall be excluded [Section 12(4)]. 
Thus, the time required for getting copies of certain decisions, mentioned under 
Section 12 is also to be excluded in computing the period of limitation as per Sub-
sections (2), (3) and (4). 
The term ―time requisite for obtaining a copy‖ means the time which is reasonably 
required for obtaining such a copy, On the explanation to Section 12, the Supreme 
Court in the case of Udayan China Bhai v. R.C. Bali, AIR 1977 SC 2319, held that by 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
157 
reading Section 12(2) with explanation it is not possible to accept the submission that 
in computing the time requisite for obtaining copy of a decree by an application made 
after preparation of the decree, the time that elapsed between the pronouncement of 
the judgement and the signing of the decree should be excluded. 
However, the time taken by the Court to prepare the decree or order before an 
application for a copy is made shall not be excluded in computing the time for 
obtaining a copy of a decree or an order. (Explanation to Section 12) 
(ii) Exclusion of time during which leave to sue or appeal as a pauper is applied for 
(Section 13). 
(iii) Exclusion of time bona fide taken in a court without jurisdiction. (Section 14) 
The relief to a person is given by Section 14 of the Act when the period of 
limitation is over, because another civil proceedings relating to the matter in issue 
had been initiated in a court which is unable to entertain it, by lack of jurisdiction or by 
any other like cause. The following conditions must co-exist for the applicability of this 
Section: 
 
(a) that the plaintiff or the applicant was prosecuting another civil proceedings 
against the defendant with due diligence; 
 
(b) that the previous suit or application related to the same matter in issue; 
 
(c) that the plaintiff or the applicant prosecuted in good-faith in that court; and 
 
(d) that the court was unable to entertain a suit or application on account of 
defect of jurisdiction or other like cause. 
(iv) Exclusion of time in certain other cases 
(a) When a suit or application for the execution of a decree has been stayed by 
an injunction or order, the time of the continuance of the injunction or order, the day 
on which it was issued or made and the day on which it was withdrawn shall be 
excluded. [Section 15(1)] 
(b) The time required to obtain the sanction or consent of the Govt. required, or a 
notice period shall also be excluded in case of suits. [Section 15(2)] 
(c) In a suit or an application for execution of a decree by any receiver or interim 
receiver or any liquidator, the period beginning with the date of institution of such 
proceeding and ending with the expiry of three months from the date of their 
appointment shall be excluded. [Section 15(3)] 
(d) The time during which a proceeding to set aside the sale has been 
prosecuted shall be excluded in case of a suit for possession by a purchaser at a sale 
in execution of a decree. [Section 15(4)] 
(e) The time during which the defendant has been absent from India and from the 
territories outside India administered by the Central Government, shall also be 
excluded. [Section 15(5)] 
(f) In case of death of a person before the right to institute a suit accrues, the 
period of limitation shall be computed from the time when there is a legal 
representative of the deceased capable of instituting such suit or making such 
EP-GCL-3 
158 
application. The same rule applies in case if defendant dies. [Sections 16(1) and (2)] 
However, the above rule does not apply to suits to enforce rights of pre-emption 
or to suits for the possession of immovable property or of a hereditary office.  
[Section 16(3)] 
(g) Where the suit or application is based upon the fraud or mistake of the 
defendant or respondent or his agent or in other cases as mentioned in Section 17, 
the period of limitation shall not begin to run until the plaintiff or applicant has 
discovered fraud or mistake subject to certain exceptions. (Section 17) 
7. EFFECT OF ACKNOWLEDGEMENT ON THE PERIOD OF LIMITATION 
Section 18 of the Act deals with the effect of acknowledgement of 
liability in respect of property or right on the period of limitation. The 
following requirements should be present for a valid acknowledgement 
as per Section 18: 
 
1. There must be an admission or acknowledgement; 
 
2. Such acknowledgement must be in respect of any property or right; 
 
3. It must be made before the expiry of period of limitation; and 
 
4. It must be in writing and signed by the party against whom such property or 
right is claimed. 
If all the above requirements are satisfied, a fresh period of limitation shall be 
computed from the time when the acknowledgement was signed. 
8. EFFECT OF PAYMENT ON ACCOUNT OF DEBT OR OF INTEREST ON 
LEGACY 
As per Section 19 of the Act where payment on account of a debt or of interest 
on a legacy is made before the expiration of the prescribed period by the person 
liable to pay the debt or legacy or by his agent duly authorised in this behalf, a fresh 
period of limitation shall be computed from the time when the payment was made. 
The proviso says that, save in the case of payment of interest made before the 1st 
day of January, 1928 an acknowledgement of the payment must appear in the 
handwriting of, or in a writing signed by the person making the payment. 
According to the explanation appended to this Section: 
 
(a) where mortgaged land is in the possession of the mortgagee, the receipt of 
the rent or produce of such land shall be deemed to be a payment; 
 
(b) ‗debt‘ does not include money payable under a decree or order of a court for 
the purpose of this Section. 
Thus, according to this section a fresh period of limitation becomes available to 
the creditor from the date of part payment when part-payment of debt is made by the 
debtor before the expiration of the period of limitation. 
9. COMPUTATION OF TIME MENTIONED IN INSTRUMENTS 
All instruments shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to be made with 
reference to the Gregorian Calendar. (Section 24)

Section 25 applies to acquisition of easements. It provides that the right to 
access and use of light or air, way, watercourse, use of water, or any other easement 
which have been peaceably enjoyed without interruption and for twenty years (thirty 
years if property belongs to Government) shall be absolute and indefeasible. Such 
period of twenty years shall be a period ending within two years next before the 
institution of the suit. 
11. LIMITATION AND WRITS UNDER THE CONSTITUTION 
The subject of limitation is dealt with in entry 13, List III of the Constitution of 
India. The Legislature may, without violating the fundamental rights, enact statutes 
prescribing limitation within which actions may be brought or varying or changing the 
existing rules of limitation either by shortening or extending time provided a 
reasonable time is allowed for enforcement of the existing right of action which would 
become barred under the amended Statute. 
The Statute of Limitation is not unconstitutional since it applies to right of action in 
future. It is a shield and not a weapon of offence (34 American Jurisprudence, P. 16). 
The State cannot place any hindrance by prescribing a period of limitation in the 
way of an aggrieved person seeking to approach the Supreme Court of India under 
Article 32 of the Constitution. To put curbs in the way of enforcement of Fundamental 
Rights through legislative action might well be questioned under Article 13(2) of the 
Constitution. It is against the State action that Fundamental Rights are claimed 
(Tilokchand Motichand v. H.P. Munshi, AIR 1970 SC 898). 
The Limitation Act does not in terms apply to a proceeding under Article 32 or 
Article 226 of the Constitution. But the Courts act on the analogy of the statute of 
limitation and refuse relief if the delay is more than the statutory period of limitation 
(State of M.P. v. Bhai Lal Bhai, AIR 1964 SC 1006). Where the remedy in a writ 
petition corresponds to a remedy in an ordinary suit and latter remedy is subject to 
bar of a statute of limitation, the Court in its writ jurisdiction adopts in the statute its 
own rule of procedure and in absence of special circumstances imposes the same 
limitation in the writ jurisdiction. 
If the right to property is extinguished by prescription under Section 27 of the 
Limitation Act, 1963, there is no subsisting right to be enforced under Article 32 of the 
Constitution. In other case where the remedy only, not the right, is extinguished by 
limitation the Court will refuse to entertain stale claims on the ground of public policy 
(Tilokchand Motichand v. H.P. Munshi, AIR 1970 SC 898).

1. Suits by mortgagors for the redemption or recovery of possession of 
immovable property mortgaged; 
 
2. Suits by mortgagee for foreclosure; 
 
3. Suits by or on behalf of the Central Government or any State Government 
including the State of Jammu and Kashmir. 
Period of 12 years: A period of 12 years is prescribed as a limitation period for 
various kinds of suits relating to immovable property, trusts and endowments. 
Period of 3 years: A period of three years has been prescribed for suits relating to 
accounts, contracts, declaratory suits, suits relating to decrees and instruments and 
suits relating to movable property. 
Period varying between 1 to 3 years: The period from 1 to 3 years has been 
prescribed for suits relating to torts and other miscellaneous matters and suits for

Period in days varying between 90 to 10 days: The minimum period of limitation 
of 10 days is prescribed for application for leave to appear and defend a suit under 
summary procedure from the date of service of the summons. For appeals against a

V.  LAW RELATING TO EVIDENCE 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
The "Law of Evidence" may be defined as a system of rules for ascertaining 
controverted questions of fact in judicial inquiries. This system of ascertaining the 
facts, which are the essential elements of a right or liability and is the primary and 
perhaps the most difficult function of the Court, is regulated by a set of rules and 
principles known as ―Law of Evidence‖. 
The Indian Evidence Act, 1872 is an Act to consolidate, define and amend the 
Law of Evidence. 
The Act extends to the whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir 
and applies to all judicial proceedings in or before any Court, including Court-martial 
(other than the Court-martial convened unde the Army Act, the Naval Discipline Act 
or the Indian Navy Discipline Act, 1934 or the Air Force Act) but not to affidavits 
presented to any Court or officer, or to proceedings before an arbitrator. 
Judicial Proceedings 
The Act does not define the term "judicial proceedings" but it is defined under 
Section 2(i) of the Criminal Procedure Code as "a proceeding in the course of which 
evidence is or may be legally taken on oath". 
However, the proceedings under the Income Tax are not "judicial proceedings" 
under this Act. That apart, the Act is also not applicable to the proceedings before an 
arbitrator. 
An affidavit is a declaration sworn or affirmed before a person competent to 
administer an oath. Thus, an affidavit per se does not become evidence in the suits 
but it can become evidence only by consent of the party or if specifically authorised 
by any provision of the law. They can be used as evidence only under Order XIX of 
the Civil Procedure Code. 
Evidence: The term evidence is defined under Section 3 of the 
Evidence Act as follows : 
―Evidence‖ means and includes: 
 
(1) all statements which the Court permits or requires to be made before it by 
witnesses, in relation to matters of fact under inquiry; such statements are 
called oral evidence;  
 
(2) all documents (including electronic records) produced for the inspection of 
the Court; such documents are called documentary evidence.  
The word evidence in the Act signifies only the instruments by means of which 
relevant facts are brought before the Court, viz., witnesses and documents, and by 
means of which the court is convinced of these facts. 
Evidence under Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 may be either oral or 
personal (i.e. all statements which the Court permits or requires to be made before it 
EP-GCL-3 
180 
by witnesses, and documentary (documents produced for the inspection of the court), 
which may be adduced in order to prove a certain fact (principal fact) which is in 
issue. There must be an open and visible connection between the principal fact and 
the evidentially facts. Facts are which form part of the same transaction, though not in 
issue, place or at different times and places. 
In general the rules of evidence are same in civil and criminal proceedings but 
there is a strong and marked difference as to the effect of evidence in civil and 
criminal proceedings. In the former a mere preponderance of probability due regard 
being had to the burden of proof, is sufficient basis of a decision, but in the latter, 
specially when the offence charged amounts to felony or treason, a much higher 
degree of assurance is required. The persuasion of guilt must amount to a moral 
certainty such as to be beyond all reasonable doubt. In other words, in civil 
proceedings it is sufficient if the evidence shows that in all probability the accused 
would have committed the wrong; but in criminal proceedings, evidences must show 
beyond all doubts that the accused alone would have committed the crime. 
Scheme of the Act: The Act is divided into three parts: 
 
Part I 
Relevancy of Facts-Chapter I containing Sections 1 to 4 deals with 
preliminary points and relevancy of facts is dealt with in Chapter II 
containing Sections 5 to 55. 
 
Part II 
On proof (Chapters III to VI) containing Sections 56 to 100. 
 Part III 
Production and effect of evidence (Chapters VII to XI containing 
Sections 101 to 167). 
Relevancy of Facts: Sections 6 to 55 of the Act deal with relevancy of facts. A 
fact is also known as Factum Prolans or a fact that proves. The question arises what 
then the term "fact" signifies? 
Fact 
According to Section 3, ―fact‖ means and includes: 
 
(a) anything, state of things, or relation of things capable of being perceived by 
the senses;  
 
(b) any mental condition of which any person is conscious.  
Thus facts are classified into physical and psychological facts. 
Illustrations 
 
(a) That there are certain objects arranged in a certain order in a certain place, 
is a fact.  
 
(b) That a man heard or saw something, is a fact.  
 
(c) That a man said certain words, is a fact.  
 
(d) That a man holds a certain opinion, has a certain intention, acts in good faith 
or fraudulently, or uses a particular word in a particular sense, or is or was at 
the specified time conscious of a particular sensation, is a fact.  
 
(e) That a man has a certain reputation, is a fact.  
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
181 
Illustrations (a), (b) and (c), are the examples of physical facts whereas the 
illustrations (d) and (e) are the examples of psychological bids. 
Evidence may be given of facts in issue and relevant facts 
According to Section 5, evidence may be given in any suit or proceeding of the 
existence or non-existence of every fact in issue and of such other facts as are 
hereinafter declared to be relevant, and of no others. 
The Explanation appended to Section 5, however, makes it clear that this section 
shall not enable any person to give evidence of a fact to which he is disentitled to 
prove by any provision of the law. 
Illustrations 
 
(a) A is tried for the murder of B by beating him with a club with the intention of 
causing his death.  
 
 At A‘s trial the following facts are in issue:- 
 
 A‘s beating B with the club; 
 
 A‘s causing B‘s death by such beating; 
 
 A‘s intention to cause B‘s death. 
 
(b) A suitor does not bring with him and have in readiness for production at the 
first hearing of the case, a bond on which he relies. This section does not 
enable him to produce the bond or prove its contents at a subsequent stage 
of the proceedings, otherwise than in accordance with the conditions 
prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure.  
It is evident that only facts in issue and relevant facts may be given in evidence. 
To understand their relevancy it is necessary to know their meanings. These terms 
are defined in Section 3. It is explained as follows:- 
Relevant Fact 
One fact is said to be relevant to another when the one is connected with the 
other in any of the ways referred to in the provisions of this Act relating to the 
relevancy of facts. (Section 3) 
Where in a case direct evidence is not available to prove a fact in issue then it 
may be proved by any circumstantial evidence and in such a case every piece of 
circumstantial evidence would be an instance of a "relevant fact". 
Logical relevancy and legal relevancy 
A fact is said to be logically relevant to another when it bears such casual relation 
with the other as to render probably the existence or non-existence of the latter. All 
facts logically relevant are not, however, legally relevant. Relevancy under the Act is 
not a question of pure logic but of law, as no fact, however logically relevant, is 
receivable in evidence unless it is declared by the Act to be relevant. Of course every 
fact legally relevant will be found to be logically relevant; but every fact logically 
relevant is not necessarily relevant under the Act as common sense or logical 
relevancy is wider than legal relevancy. A judge might in ordinary transaction, take 
one fact as evidence of another and act upon it himself, when in Court, he may rule 
EP-GCL-3 
182 
? 
that it was legally irrelevant. And he may exclude facts, although logically relevant, if 
they appear to him too remote to be really material to the issue. 
 
Test your knowledge 
State whether the following statement is “True” or “False” 
All facts logically relevant are not, however, legally relevant.  
 
True 
 
False 
Correct answer: True 
 
Legal relevancy and admissibility 
Relevancy and admissibility are not co-extensive or interchangeable terms. A fact 
may be legally relevant, yet its reception in evidence may be prohibited on the 
grounds of public policy, or on some other ground. Similarly every admissible fact is 
not necessarily relevant. The tenth Chapter of the Act makes a number of facts 
receivable in evidence, but these facts are not ―relevant‖ under the second Chapter 
which alone defines relevancy. 
Facts in issue 
According to Section 3 the expression "facts in issue" means and includes-any 
fact from which, either by itself or in connection with other facts, the existence, non-
existence, nature or extent of any right, liability, or disability, asserted or denied in 
any suit or proceedings, necessarily follows. 
Explanation—Whenever, under the provisions of the law for the time being in 
force relating to Civil Procedure, any Court records an issue of fact, the fact to be 
asserted or denied in the answer to such issue is a fact in issue. 
Illustration 
A is accused of the murder of B. 
At his trial the following facts may be in issue: 
that A caused B‘s death; 
that A intended to cause B‘s death; 
that A had received grave and sudden provocation from B; 
that A at the time of doing the act which caused B‘s death, was, by reason of 
unsoundness of mind, incapable of knowing its nature. 
A fact in issue is called as the principal fact to be proved or factum probandum 
and the relevant fact the evidentiary fact or factum probans from which the principal 
fact follows. The fact which constitute the right or liability called ―fact in issue‖ and in a 
particular case the question of determining the ―facts in issue‖ depends upon the rule 
of the substantive law which defines the rights and liabilities claimed. 
Facts in issue and issues of fact 
Under Civil Procedure Code, the Court has to frame issues on all disputed facts 
which are necessary in the case. These are called issues of fact but the subject 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
183 
matter of an issue of fact is always a fact in issue. Thus when described in the 
context of Civil Procedure Code, it is an ‗issue of fact‘ and when described in the 
language of Evidence Act it is a ‗fact in issue‘. Thus as discussed above, distinction 
between facts in issue and relevant facts is of fundamental importance. 
Classification of relevant facts 
Principles of Sections relating to relevancy of facts are mere rules of logic. 
Relevant facts may be classified in the following form: 
 
(a) facts connected with the facts to be proved; (Sections 6 to 16)  
 
(b) statement about the facts to be proved e.g. admission, confession; 
(Sections 17 to 31)  
 
(c) statements by persons who cannot be called as witnesses; (Sections 32 to 33) 
 
(d) statements made under special circumstances; (Sections 34 to 38)  
 
(e) how much of a statement is to be proved; (Section 39)  
 
(f) judgements of Courts of justice, when relevant; (Sections 40 to 44)  
 
(g) opinions of third persons, when relevant; (Sections 45 to 51)  
 
(h) character of parties in Civil cases and of the accussed in criminal cases. 
(Sections 52 to 55)  
Two fundamental rules on which the law of evidence is based are: (a) no facts 
other than those having rational probative value should be admitted in evidence and, 
(b) all facts having rational probative value are admissible in evidence unless 
excluded by a positive rule of paramount importance. 
The Court ‗may presume‘ a fact as may be provided by the Act, unless and until it 
is disproved or may call for proof of it. The court shall presume a fact whenever it is 
directed by this Act, and shall regard such fact as proved unless and until it is 
disproved (Section 4). Presumption has been defined as an inference, affirmative or 
disaffirmative of the existence of some fact, drawn by a judicial tribunal, by a proces 
of probable reasoning from some matter of fact, either judicially noticed, admitted or 
established by legal evidence to the satisfaction of the tribunal. It is an inference of 
the existence of some fact, which is drawn, without evidence, from some other fact 
already proved or assumed to exist (wills). Presumption is either of a fact or law. 
These presumptions which are inference are always rebuttable. Presumption of law is 
either conclusive or rebuttable. 
The Act also provides that when one fact is declared by this Act to be conclusive 
proof of another, the court shall on the proof of the one fact, regard the other as 
proved and shall not allow evidence to be given for the purpose of disproving it. 
2. RELEVANCY OF FACTS CONNECTED WITH THE FACT TO BE PROVED  
The facts coming under this category are as follows: 
(1) Res gestae or facts which though not in issue, are so connected with a fact in 
issue as to form part of the same transaction.  
Section 6 embodies the rule of admission of evidence relating to what is 
commonly known as res gestae. Acts or declarations accompanying the transaction 
EP-GCL-3 
184 
or the facts in issue are treated as part of the res gestae and admitted as evidence. 
The obvious ground for admission of such evidence is the spontaneity and 
immediacy of the act or declaration in question. 
Illustration 
A is accused of the murder of B by beating him. Whatever was said or done by A 
or B or the by-standers at the beating, or so shortly before or after it as to form part of 
the transaction, is a relevant fact.  
The word ‗by-standers‘ means the persons who are present at the time of the 
beating and not the persons who gather on the spot after the beating (46 P.L.R. 353); 
(1945) Lah. 146). 
(b) A is accused of waging war against the ‗Government of India by taking part in 
an armed insurrection in which property is destroyed, troops are attacked and gaols 
are broken open. The occurrence of these facts is relevant, as forming part of the 
general transaction, although A may not have been present at all of them.  
(c) A sues B for a libel contained in a letter forming part of a correspondence. 
Letters between the parties relating to the subject out of which the libel arose, and 
forming part of the correspondence in which it is contained, are relevant facts, though 
they do not contain the libel itself.  
(d) The question is, whether certain goods ordered from B were delivered to A. 
The goods were delivered to several intermediate persons successively. Each 
delivery is a relevant fact.  
Thus, the evidence about the fact which is also connected with the same 
transaction, cannot be said to be inadmissible. 
The above section lays down the rule which in English text books is treated under 
the head of res gestae. It may be broadly defined as matter incidental to the main fact 
and explanatory of it, including acts and words which are so closely connected 
therewith as to constitute a part of the same transaction. 
The essence of the doctrine of res gestae is that the facts which, though not in 
issue are so connected with the fact in issue as to form part of the same transaction 
and thereby become relevant like fact in issue (AIR 1957 Cal. 709). 
(2) Facts constituting the occasion, or effect of, or opportunity or state of things 
for the occurrence of the fact to be proved whether it be a fact or another relevant 
fact. (Section 7)  
Illustrations 
(a) The question is, whether A robbed B.  
The facts that, shortly before the robbery, B went to a fair with money in his 
possession, and that he showed it, or mentioned the fact that he had it, to third 
persons, are relevant. 
(b) The question is, whether A murdered B.  
Marks on the ground, produced by a struggle at or near the place whether the 
murder was committed, are relevant facts. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
185 
(c) The question is, whether A poisoned B.  
The state of B‘s health before the symptoms ascribed to poison, and habits of B 
known to A, which afforded an opportunity for the administration of poison, are 
relevant facts. 
The above transaction provides that, though they are not part of the same 
transaction, are relevant if they are the occasions caused or effects of facts of an 
issue. 
(3) Motive, preparation and previous or subsequent conduct.  
According to Section 8, any fact is relevant which shows or constitutes a motive 
or preparation for any fact in issue or relevant fact. 
Motive means which moves a person to act in a particular way. It is different from 
intention. The substantive law is rarely concerned with motive, but the existence of a 
motive, from the point of view of evidence would be a relevant fact, in every criminal 
case. That is the first step in every investigation. Motive is a psychological fact and 
the accused‘s motive, will have to be proved by circumstantial evidence. When the 
question is as to whether a person did a particular act, the fact that he made 
preparations to do it, would certainly be relevant for the purpose of showing that he 
did it. 
The Section makes the conduct of certain persons relevant. Conduct means 
behaviour. The conduct of the parties is relevant. The conduct to be relevant must be 
closely connected with the suit, proceeding, a fact in issue or a relevant fact, i.e., if 
the Court believes such conduct to exist, it must assist the Court in coming to a 
conclusion on the matter in controversy. It must influence the decision. If these 
conditions are satisfied it is immaterial whether the conduct was previous to or 
subsequent to the happening of the fact in issue. 
Illustrations 
(a) A is tried for the murder of B.  
The fact that A murdered C, that B knew that A had murdered C, and that B had 
tried to extort money from A by threatening to make his knowledge public, are 
relevant. 
(b) A sues B upon a bond for the payment of money. B denies the making of the 
bond.  
The fact that, at the time when the bond was alleged to be made, B required 
money for a particular purpose, is relevant. 
(c) A is tried for the murder of B by poison.  
The fact that, before the death of B, A procured poison similar to that which was 
administered to B, is relevant. 
(d) The question is, whether a certain document is the will of A.  
The facts that, not long before the date of the alleged will, A made inquiry into 
matters to which the provisions of the alleged will relate that he consulted Vakils in 
reference to making the will, and that he caused drafts of other wills to be prepared, 
of which he did not approve, are relevant. 
EP-GCL-3 
186 
(e) A is accused of a crime.  
The facts that, either before, or at the time of, or after the alleged crime, A 
provided evidence which would tend to give to the facts of the case an appearance 
favourable to himself, or that he destroyed or concealed evidence, or prevented the 
presence or procured the absence of persons who might have been witnesses, or 
suborned persons to give false evidence respecting it, are relevant. 
(f) The question is, whether A robbed B.  
The facts that, after B was robbed, C said in A‘s presence - ―the police is coming 
to look for the man who robbed B‖, and that immediately afterwards A ran away, are 
relevant. 
(g) The question is, whether A owes B rupees 10,000.  
The facts that A asked C to lend him money, and that D said to C in A‘s presence 
and hearing—―I advise you not to trust A, for he owes B 10,000 rupees‖, and that A 
went away without making any answer, are relevant facts. 
(h) The question is, whether A committed a crime.  
The fact that A absconded after receiving a letter warning him that inquiry was 
being made for the criminal, and the contents of the letter, are relevant. 
(i) A is accused of a crime.  
The facts that, after the commission of the alleged crime, he absconded, or was 
in possession of property or the proceeds of properly acquired by the crime, or 
attempted to conceal things which were or might have been used in committing it, are 
relevant. 
(j) The question is, whether A was ravished.  
The facts that, shortly after the alleged rape, she made a complaint relating to the 
crime, the circumstances under which, and the terms in which, the complaint was 
made, are relevant. 
The fact that, without making a complaint she said that she had been ravished is 
not relevant as conduct under this Section, though it may be relevant as a dying 
declaration under Section 32, clause (1), or as corroborative evidence under  
Section 157. 
(k) the question is, whether A was robbed.  
The fact that, soon after the alleged robbery, he made a complaint relating to the 
offence, the circumstances under which, and the terms in which, the complaint was 
made are relevant. 
The fact that he said he had been robbed without making any complaint, is not 
relevant, as conduct under this section, though it may be relevant as a dying 
declaration under Section 32, clause (1), or as corroborative evidence under  
Section 157. 
What is relevant under Section 8 is the particular act upon the statement and the 
statement and the act must be so blended together as to form a part of a thing 
observed by the witnesses and sought to be proved. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
187 
(4) Facts necessary to explain or introduce relevant facts.  
According to Section 9, such facts are - 
 
(i) which are necessary to explain or introduce a fact in issue or relevant fact, 
or  
 
(ii) which support or rebut an inference suggested by a fact in issue or relevant 
fact, or  
 
(iii) which establish the identity of a person or thing whose identity is relevant, or 
fix the time or place at which any fact in issue or relevant fact happened, or  
 
(iv) which show the relation of parties by whom any such fact was transacted, 
are relevant in so far as they are necessary for that purpose.  
Facts which establish the identity of an accused person are relevant under 
Section 9. 
Illustrations 
(a) The question is, whether a given document is the will of A.  
The state of A‘s property and of his family at the date of the alleged will may be 
relevant facts. 
(b) A sues B for a libel imputing disgraceful conduct to A; B affirms that the 
matter alleged to be libellous is true.  
The position and relations of the parties at the time when the libel was published 
may be relevant facts as introductory to the facts in issue. 
The particulars of a dispute between A and B about a matter unconnected with 
the alleged libel are irrelevant, though the fact that there was a dispute may be 
relevant if it affected the relations between A and B. 
(c) A is accused of a crime.  
The fact that, soon after the commission of the crime, A absconded from his 
house, is relevant under Section 8, as conduct subsequent to and affected by facts in 
issue. 
The fact that, at the time when he left house, he had sudden and urgent business 
at the place to which he went, is relevant, as tending to explain the fact that the left 
home suddenly. 
The details of the business on which he left are not relevant, except in so far as 
they are necessary to show that the business was sudden and urgent. 
(d) A sues B for inducing C to break a contract of service made by him with A. C, 
on leaving A‘s service, says to A—―I am leaving you because B has made me a 
better offer‖. This statement is a relevant fact as explanatory of C‘s conduct, which is 
relevant as a fact in issue.  
(e) A accused of theft, is seen to give the stolen property to B, who is seen to 
give it to A‘s wife. B says as he delivers it - ―A says you are to hide this‖. B‘s 
statement is relevant as explanatory of a fact which is part of the transaction.

3. STATEMENTS ABOUT THE FACTS TO BE PROVED  
The general rule known as the hearsay rule is that what is stated about the fact in 
question is irrelevant. To this general rule there are three exceptions which are : 
 
(i) Admissions and confessions;  
 
(ii) Statements as to certain matters under certain circumstances by persons 
who are not witnesses; and  
 
(iii) Statements made under special circumstances.  
(i) Admissions and Confessions  
Sections 17 to 31 lay down the first exception to the general rule known as 
admissions and confessions. 
Admissions 
An admission is defined in Section 17 as a statement, oral or 
documentary or contained in electronic form which suggests any 
inference as to any fact in issue or relevant fact, and which is made by 
any of the persons, and under the circumstances mentioned under 
Sections 18 to 20. Thus, whether a statement amounts to an admission or not 
depends upon the question whether it was made by any of the persons and in any of 
the circumstances described in Sections 18-20 and whether it suggests an inference 
as to a fact in issue or a relevant fact in the case. Thus admission may be verbal or 
contained in documents as maps, bills, receipts, letters, books etc. 
(However, the word ‗statement‘ has not been defined in the Act. Therefore the 
ordinary dictionary meaning is to be followed which is ―something that is stated.") 
An admission may be made by a party, by the agent or predecessor-in-interest of 
a party, by a person having joint propriety of pecuniary interest in the subject matter 
(Section 18) or by a ―reference‖ (Section 20). 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
189 
An admission is the best evidence against the party making the same unless it is 
untrue and made under the circumstances which does not make it binding on him. 
An admission by the Government is merely relevant and non conclusive, unless 
the party to whom they are made has acted upon and thus altered his detriment. 
An admission must be clear, precise, not vague or ambiguous. In Basant Singh v. 
Janky Singh, (1967) 1 SCR 1, The Supreme Court held: 
―(1) Section 17 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 makes no distinction between an 
admission made by a party in a pleading and other admission. Under the Indian law, 
an admission made by a party in a plaint signed and verified by him may be used as 
evidence against him in other suits. In other suits, this admission cannot be regarded 
as conclusive and it is open to the party to show that it is not true.  
(2) All the statements made in the plaint are admissible as evidence. The Court 
is, however, not bound to accept all the statements as correct. The Court may accept 
some of the statements and reject the rest.‖  
Admission means conceding something against the person making the 
admission. That is why it is stated as a general rule (the exceptions are in Section 
21), that admissions must be self-harming; and because a person is unlikely to make 
a statement which is self-harming unless it is true evidence of such admissions as 
received in Court. 
These Sections deal only with admissions oral and written. Admissions by 
conduct are not covered by these sections. The relevancy of such admissions by 
conduct depends upon Section 8 and its explanations. 
Oral admissions as to the contents of electronic records are not relevant unless 
the genuineness of the record produced is in question. (Section 22A) 
Confessions 
Sections 24 to 30 deal with confessions. However, the Act does not define a 
confession but includes in it admissions of which it is a species. Thus confessions are 
special form of admissions. Whereas every confession must be an admission but 
every admission may not amount to a confession. Sections 27 to 30 deal with 
confessions which the Court will take into account. A confession is relevant as an 
admission unless it is made: 
 
(i) to a person in authority in consequence of some inducement, threat or 
promise held out by him in reference to the charge against the accused;  
 
(ii) to a Police Officer; or  
 
(iii) to any one at a time when the accused is in the custody of a Police Officer 
and no Magistrate is present.  
Thus, a statement made by an accused person if it is an admission, is admissible 
in evidence. The confession is an evidence only against its maker and against 
another person who is being jointly tried with him for an offence. 
Section 30 is an exception to the general rule that confession is only an evidence 
against the confessor and not against the others. 
EP-GCL-3 
190 
? 
The confession made in front of magistrate in a native state recorded is 
admissible against its maker is also admissible against co-accused under Section 30. 
The Privy Council in Pakala Narayanaswami v. Emperor, (1929) PC 47, observed 
that: 
No statement that contains self exculpatory matter can amount 
to confession, if the exculpatory statement is of some fact which 
if true would negative the offence alleged to be confessed. All 
confessions are admissions but not vice versa. 
A confession must, either admit, in terms the offence, or substantially all the facts 
which constitute the offence. An admission of a gravely incriminating fact, is not of 
itself a confession. For example, an admission that the accused was the owner of 
and was in recent possession of the knife or revolver which caused a death with no 
explanation of any other man‘s possession of the knife or revolver. A confession 
cannot be construed as meaning a statement by the accused suggesting the 
inference that he committed the crime. 
According to Section 24, confession caused by inducement, threat or promise is 
irrelevant. To attract the prohibition contained in Section 24 of the Evidence Act the 
following six facts must be established: 
 
(i) that the statement in question is a confession;  
 
(ii) that such confession has been made by an accused person;  
 
(iii) that it has been made to a person in authority;  
 
(iv) that the confession has been obtained by reason of any inducement, threat 
or promise proceeded from a person in authority;  
 
(v) such inducement, threat or promise, must have reference to the charge 
against the accused person;  
 
(vi) the inducement, threat or promise must in the opinion of the Court be 
sufficient to give the accused person grounds, which would appear to him 
reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or 
avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against 
him.  
To exclude the confession it is not always necessary to prove that it was the 
result of inducement, threat or promise. It is sufficient if a legitimate doubt is created 
in the mind of the Court or it appears to the Court that the confession was not 
voluntary. It is however for the accused to create this doubt and not for the 
prosecution to prove that it was voluntarily made. A confession if voluntary and 
truthfully made is an efficacious proof of guilt.

Confessions vs. Admissions 
A confession, however, is received in evidence for the same reason as an 
admission, and like an admission it must be considered as a whole. Further there can 
be an admission either in a civil or a criminal proceedings, whereas there can be a 
confession only in criminal proceedings. An admission need not be voluntary to be 
relevant, though it may effect its weight; but a confession to be relevant, must be 
voluntary. There can be relevant admission made by an agent or even a stranger, 
but, a confession to be relevant must be made by the accused himself. A confession 
of a co-accused is not strictly relevant, though it may be taken into consideration, 
under Section 30 in special circumstances. 
Confessions are classified as: (a) judicial, and (b) extra-judicial. Judicial 
confessions are those made before a Court or recorded by a Magistrate under 
Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code after following the prescribed procedure 
such as warning the accused that he need not to make the confession and that if he 
made it, it would be used against him. Extra-judicial confessions are those which are 
made either to the police or to any person other than Judges and Magistrates as 
such. 
An extra-judicial confession, if voluntary, can be relied upon by the Court along 
with other evidence. It will have to be proved just like any other fact. The value of the 
evidence depends upon the truthfulness of the witness to whom it is made. 
In Ram Khilari v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1999 SC 1002, the Supreme Court held 
that where an extra-judicial confession was made before a witness who was a close 
relative of the accused and the testimony of said witness was reliable and truthful, the 
conviction on the basis of extra judicial confession is proper. 
In another case, the Supreme Court has further held that the law does not require 
that the evidence of an extra-judicial confession should be corroborated in all cases. 
When such confession was proved by an independent witness who was a 
responsible officer and one who bore no animus against the accused, there is hardly 
any justification to disbelieve it. Also, where the Court finds that the confession made 
by the accused to his friend was unambiguous and unmistakably conveyed that the 
accused was the perpetrator of the crime and the testimony of the friend was truthful, 
reliable and trustworthy, a conviction based on such extra-judicial confession is 
proper and no corroboration is necessary. Much importance could not be given to 
minor discrepancies and technical errors (Vinayak Shivajirao Pol v. State of 
Maharashtra, 1998 (1) Scale 159). 
Illustrations 
1. A undertakes to collect rents from C on behalf of B. B sues A for not collecting 
rent due from C to B.  
A denies that rent was due from C to B. A statement by C that he owed rent to B, 
is an admission, and is a relevant fact as against A, if A denies that C did owe rent to 
B. 
2. The question is, whether a horse sold by A to B is sound.  
A says to B
‖Go and ask C, C knows all about it‖. C‘s statement is an 
admission. 
EP-GCL-3 
192 
3. The question between A and B is, whether a certain deed is or is not forged. A 
affirms that it is genuine, B holds that it is forged.  
A may prove a statement by B that the deed is genuine, and B may prove a 
statement by A that the deed is forged; but A cannot prove a statement by himself 
that the deed is genuine, nor can B prove a statement by himself that the deed is 
forged. 
4. A is accused of a crime committed by him at Calcutta.  
He produces a letter written by himself and dated at Lahore on that day, and 
bearing the Lahore post-mark of that day. The statement in the date of the letter is 
admissible, because if A were dead, it would be admissible under Section 32,  
clause (2). 
5. A and B are jointly tried for the murder of C. It is proved that A said-―B and I 
murdered C‖. The Court may consider the effect of this confession as against B.  
6. A is on his trial for the murder of C. There is evidence to show that C was 
murdered by A and B, and that B said—―A and I murdered C‖.  
This statement may not be taken into consideration by the Court against A, as B 
is not being jointly tried. (If there is joint trial Section 30 applies) 
Illustrations 5 and 6 are exceptions to the general rule that a confession is only 
evidence against the person who makes the confession. These are based on Section 
30 of the Act. 
(ii) Statements by persons who cannot be called as witnesses  
Certain statements made by persons who are dead, or cannot be found or 
produced without unreasonable delay or expense, makes the second exception to the 
general rule. However, the following conditions must be fulfilled for the relevancy of 
the statements: 
 
(a) That the statement must relate to a fact in issue or relevant fact,  
 
(b) That the statement must fall under any of following categories:  
 
(i) the statement is made by a person as to the cause of this death or as to 
any of the circumstances resulting in his death;  
 
(ii) statement made in the course of business;  
 
(iii) Statement which is against the interest of the maker;  
 
(iv) a statement giving the opinion as to the public right or custom or matters 
of general interest;  
 
(v) a statement made before the commencement of the controversy as to 
the relationship of persons, alive or dead, if the maker of the statement 
has special means of knowledge on the subject;  
 
(vi) a statement made before the commencement of the controversy as to 
the relationship of persons deceased, made in any will or deed relating 
to family affairs to which any such deceased person belong;  
 
(vii) a statement in any will, deed or other document relating to any 
transaction by which a right or custom was created, claimed, modified, 
etc.;  
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
193 
 
(viii) a statement made by a number of persons expressing their feelings or 
impression;  
 
(ix) evidence given in a judicial proceeding or before a person authorised by 
law to take it, provided that the proceeding was between the same 
parties or their representatives in interest and the adverse party in the 
first proceeding had the right and opportunity to cross examine and the 
questions in issue were substantially the same as in the first proceeding.  
Illustrations 
(a) The question is, whether A was murdered by B; or  
A dies of injuries received in a transaction in the course of which she was 
ravished. The question is, whether she was ravished by B; or 
The question is, whether A was killed by B under such circumstances that a suit 
would lie against B by A‘s widow. 
Statements made by A as to the course of his or her death, referring respectively 
to the murder, the rape and the actionable wrong under consideration are relevant 
facts. 
(b) The question is as to the date of A‘s birth.  
An entry in the diary of a deceased surgeon regularly kept in the course of 
business, stating that, on a given day, he attended A‘s mother and delivered her of a 
son, is a relevant fact. 
(c) The question is, whether A and B were legally married.  
The statement of a deceased clergyman that he married them under such 
circumstances that the celebration would be a crime, is relevant. 
(d) The question is, whether A, who is dead, was the father of B.  
A statement by A that B was his own son, is a relevant fact. 
(e) A sues B for libel expressed in a painted caricature exposed in a shop 
window. The question is as to the similarity of the caricature and its libellous 
character. The remarks of a crowd of spectators on these points may be proved.  
(iii) Statements made under special circumstances  
The following statements become relevant on account of their having been made 
under special circumstances: 
 
(i) Entries made in books of account, including those maintained in an 
electronic form regularly kept in the course of business. Such entries, though 
relevant, cannot, alone, be sufficient to charge a person with liability; 
(Section 34)  
 
(ii) Entries made in public or official records or an electronic record made by a 
public servant in the discharge of his official duties, or by any other person in 
performance of a duty specially enjoined by the law; (Section 35)

(iii) Statements made in published maps or charts generally offered for the 
public sale, or in maps or plans made under the authority of the Central 
Government or any State government; (Section 36)  
 
(iv) Statement as to fact of public nature contained in certain Acts or notification; 
(Section 37)  
 
(v) Statement as to any foreign law contained in books purporting to be printed 
or published by the Government of the foreign country, or in reports of 
decisions of that country. (Section 38)  
When any statement of which evidence is given forms part of a longer statement, 
or of a conversation or part of an isolated document, or is contained in a document 
which forms part of a book, or is contained in part of electronic record or of a 
connected series of letters or papers, evidence shall be given of so much and no 
more of the statement, conversation, document, electronic record, book or of letters 
or papers as the Court considers necessary in that particular case to the full 
understanding of the nature and effect of the statement, and of the circumstances 
under which it was made. (Section 39)

OPINION OF THIRD PERSONS WHEN RELEVANT  
The general rule is that opinion of a witness on a question whether of fact or law, 
is irrelevant. However, there are some exceptions to this general rule. These are: 
(i) Opinions of experts. (Section 45)  
Illustrations 
(a) The question is, whether the death of A was caused by poison.  
The opinions of experts as to the symptoms produced by the poison by which A 
is supposed to have died, are relevant. 
(b) The question is, whether a certain document was written by A. Another 
document is produced which is proved or admitted to have been written by A.  
The opinions of experts on the question whether the two documents were written 
by the same person or by different persons, are relevant. Similarly the opinions of 
 
 
EP-GCL-3 
195 
experts on typewritten documents as to whether a given document is typed on a 
particular typewriter is relevant. 
As a general rule the opinion of a witness on a question whether of fact, or of law, 
is irrelevant. Witness has to state the facts which he has seen, heard or perceived, 
and noted the conclusion, form of observations. The functions of drawing inferences 
from facts is a judicial function and must be performed by the Court. However, to this 
general rule, there are some exceptions as indicated in Section 45. Opinions of 
experts are relevant upon a point of (a) foreign law (b) science (c) art (d) identity of 
hand writing (e) finger impression special knowledge of the subject matter of enquiry 
become relevant. 
 
(ii) Facts which support or are inconsistent with the opinions of experts are also 
made relevant. (Section 46)  
 
(iii) Others: In addition to the opinions of experts, opinion of any other person is 
also relevant in the following cases :  
 
(a) Opinion as to the handwriting of a person if the person giving the 
opinion is acquainted with the handwriting of the person in question; 
(Section 47)  
 
(b) Opinion as to the digital signature of any person, the opinion of the 
Certifying Authority which has issued the Digital Signature Certificate; 
(Section 47A)  
 
(c) Opinion as to the existence of any general right or custom if the person 
giving the opinion is likely to be aware of the existence of such right or 
custom; (Section 48)  
 
(d) Opinion as to usages etc. words and terms used in particular districts, 
if the person has special means of knowledge on the subject; 
(Section 49)  
 
(e) Opinion expressed by conduct as the existence of any relationship by 
persons having special means of knowledge on the subject. 
(Section 50)  
5. FACTS OF WHICH EVIDENCE CANNOT BE GIVEN  
    (PRIVILIGED COMMUNICATIONS)  
There are some facts of which evidence cannot be given though they 
are relevant. Such facts are stated under Sections 122, 123, 126 and 
127, where evidence is prohibited under those Sections. They are 
also referred to as ‗privileged communications‘ 
A witness though compellable to give evidence is privileged in respect of 
particular matters within the limits of which he is not bound to answer questions while 
giving evidence. These are based on public policy and are as follows: 
 
(i) Evidence of a Judge or Magistrate in regard to certain matters; (Section 121)  
 
(ii) Communications during marriage; (Section 122)  
 
(iii) Affairs of State; (Section 123)  
 
(iv) Official communications; (Section 124)  
EP-GCL-3 
196 
? 
 
(v) Source of information of a Magistrate or Police officer or Revenue officer as 
to commission of an offence or crime; (Section 125)  
 
(vi) In the case of professional communication between a client and his 
barrister, attorney or other professional or legal advisor (Sections 126 and 
129). But this privilege is not absolute and the client is entitled to waive it.  
Under Section 122 of the Act, communication between the husband and the wife 
during marriage is privileged and its disclosure cannot be enforced. This provision is 
based on the principle of domestic peace and confidence between the spouses. The 
Section contains two parts; the first part deals with the privilege of the witness while 
the second part of the Section deals with the privilege of the husband or wife of the 
witness. 
Evidence as to affairs of State 
Section 123 applies only to evidence derived from unpublished official record 
relating to affairs of State. According to Section 123, no one shall be permitted to give 
any evidence derived from unpublished official records relating to any affairs of State, 
except with the permission of the officer at the head of the department concerned, 
who shall give or withhold such permission as he thinks fit. 
Professional communications 
Section 126 to 129 deal with the professional communications between a legal 
adviser and a client, which are protected from disclosure. A client cannot be 
compelled and a legal adviser cannot be allowed without the express consent of his 
client to disclose oral or documentary communications passing between them in 
professional confidence. The rule is founded on the impossibility of conducting legal 
business without professional assistance and securing full and unreserved 
communication between the two. Under Sections 126 and 127 neither a legal adviser 
i.e. a barrister, attorney, pleader or vakil (Section 126) nor his interpreter, clerk or 
servant (Section 128) can be permitted to disclose any communication made to him 
in the course and for the purpose of professional employment of such legal adviser or 
to state the contents or condition of any document with which any such person has 
become acquainted in the course and for the purpose of such employment. 
In general it is not open to a party to test the credit or impeach the ―truthfulness of 
a witness offered by him. But the Court can in its discretion allow a party to cross 
examine his witness‖ if the witness unexpectedly turns hostile. (Section 154)

6. ORAL, DOCUMENTARY AND CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE  
As discussed above, all facts (except two Sections 56 and 58) which are neither 
admitted nor are subject to judicial notice must be proved. The Act divides the subject 
of proof into two parts: (i) proof of facts other than the contents of documents; (ii) 
proof of documents including proof of execution of documents and proof of existence, 
condition and contents of documents. 
However, all facts except contents of documents or electronic records may be 
proved by oral evidence (Section 59) which must in all cases be ―direct‖ (Section 60). 
The direct evidence means the evidence of the person who perceived the fact to 
which he deposes. 
Thus, the two broad rules regarding oral evidence are: 
 
(i) all facts except the contents of documents may be proved by oral evidence;  
 
(ii) oral evidence must in all cases be ―direct‖.  
Oral evidence means statements which the Court permits or requires to be made 
before it by witnesses in relation to matters of fact under inquiry. But, if a witness is 
unable to speak he may give his evidence in any manner in which he can make it 
intelligible as by writing or by signs. (Section 119) 
Direct evidence 
In Section 60 of the Evidence Act, expression "oral evidence" has an altogether 
different meaning. It is used in the sense of "original evidence" as distinguished from 
"hearsay" evidence and it is not used in contradicition to "circumstantial" or 
"presumptive evidence". According to Section 60 oral evidence must in all cases 
whatever, be direct; that is to say: 
 
— if it refers to a fact which could be seen, it must be the evidence of a witness 
who says he saw it; 
 
— if it refers to a fact which could be heard, it must be the evidence of a 
witness who says he heard it; 
 
— if it refers to a fact which could be perceived by any other sense or in any 
other manner, it must be the evidence of a witness who says he perceived it 
by that sense or in that manner; 
 
— if it refers to an opinion or to the grounds on which that opinion is held, it 
must be the evidence of the person who holds that opinion on those 
grounds. 
Thus, if the fact to be proved is one that could be seen, the person who saw the 
fact must appear in the Court to depose it, and if the fact to be proved is one that 
could be heard, the person who heard it must appear in the Court to depose before it 
and so on. In defining the direct evidence in Section 60, the Act impliedly enacts what 
is called the rule against hearsay. Since the evidence as to a fact which could be 
seen, by a person who did not see it, is not direct but hearsay and so is the evidence 
as to a statement, by a person who did hear it. 
EP-GCL-3 
198 
Documentary evidence 
A "document" means any matter expressed or described upon any substance by 
means of letters, figures or marks, or by more than one of those means, intended to 
be used, or which may be used for the purpose of recording that matter. Documents 
produced for the inspection of the Court is called Documentary Evidence. Section 60 
provides that the contents of a document must be proved either by primary or by 
secondary evidence. 
Primary evidence 
"Primary evidence" means the document itself produced for the 
inspection of the Court (Section 62). The rule that the best evidence 
must be given of which the nature of the case permits has often been 
regarded as expressing the great fundamental principles upon which 
the law of evidence depends. The general rule requiring primary evidence of producing 
documents is commonly said to be based on the best evidence principle and to be 
supported by the so called presumption that if inferior evidence is produced where 
better might be given, the latter would tell against the withholder. 
Secondary evidence 
Secondary evidence is generally in the form of compared copies, 
certified copies or copies made by such mechanical processes as in 
themselves ensure accuracy. Section 63 defines the kind of 
secondary evidence permitted by the Act. According to Section 63, 
"secondary evidence" means and includes. 
 
(1) certified copies given under the provisions hereafter contained;  
 
(2) copies made from the original by mechanical processes which in themselves 
ensure the accuracy of the copy, and copies compared with such copies;  
 
(3) copies made from or compared with the original;  
 
(4) counterparts of documents as against the parties who did not execute them;  
 
(5) oral accounts of the contents of a document given by some person who has 
himself seen it.  
Illustrations 
(a) A photograph of an original is secondary evidence of its contents, though the 
two have not been compared, if it is proved that the thing photographed was the 
original.  
(b) A copy compared with a copy of a letter made by a copying machine is 
secondary evidence of the contents of the letter if it is shown that the copy made by 
the copying machine was made from the original.  
Section 65 stipulates the cases in which secondary evidence relating to 
documents may be given. As already stated, documents must be proved by primary 
evidence but in certain cases for example, where the document is lost or destroyed or 
the original is of such a nature as not to be easily, movable, or consists of numerous 
documents, or is a public document or under some law by a certified copy, the 
existence, condition or contents of the document may be proved by secondary 
evidence. 
 
 
EP-GCL-3

? 
Special Provisions as to Evidence Relating to Electronic Record  
Section 65A provides that the contents of electronic records may be proved in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 65B. 
Under Section 65B(1) any information contained in an electronic record which is 
printed on a paper, stored, recorded or copied in optical or magnetic media produced 
by a computer (hereinafter referred to as the computer output) shall be deemed to be 
also a document, if the conditions mentioned in this Section are satisfied in relation to 
the information and computer in question and shall be admissible in any proceedings, 
without further proof or production of the original, as evidence of any contents of the 
original or of any fact stated therein of which direct evidence would be admissible. 
The conditions in respect of a computer output related above, have been stipulated 
under Section 65B(2) of the Evidence Act. 
Circumstantial evidence 
In English law the expression direct evidence is used to signify evidence relating 
to the ‗fact in issue‘ (factum probandum) whereas the terms circumstantial evidence, 
presumptive evidence and indirect evidence are used to signify evidence which 
relates only to "relevant fact" (facta probandum). However, under Section 60 of the 
Evidence Act, the expression "direct evidence" has altogether a different meaning 
and it is not intended to exclude circumstantial evidence of things which could be 
seen, heard or felt. Thus, evidence whether direct or circumstantial under English law 
is "direct" evidence under Section 60. Before acting on circumstances put forward are 
satisfactorily proved and whether the proved circumstances are sufficient to bring the 
guilt to the accused the Court should not view in isolation the circumstantial evidence 
but it must take an overall view of the matter.

(b) All facts except the contents of documents may be proved by oral 
evidence.

(d) It can be indirect. 
Correct answer: (a) and (b) 
 
7. PRESUMPTIONS  
The Act recognises some rules as to presumptions. Rules of presumption are 
deduced from enlightened human knowledge and experience and are drawn from the 
connection, relation and coincidence of facts and circumstances. A presumption is 
not in itself an evidence but only makes a prima facie case for the party in whose 
favour it exists. A presumption is a rule of law that courts or juries shall or may draw a 
particular inference from a particular fact or from particular evidence unless and untill 
the truth of such inference is disproved. There are three categories of presumptions: 
 
(i) presumptions of law, which is a rule of law that a particular inference shall 
be drawn by a court from particular circumstances.  
EP-GCL-3 
200 
 
(ii) presumptions of fact, it is a rule of law that a fact otherwise doubtful may be 
inferred from a fact which is proved.  
 
(iii) mixed presumptions, they consider mainly certain inferences between the 
presumptions of law and presumptions of fact.  
The terms presumption of law and presumption of fact are not defined by the Act. 
Section 4 only refers to the terms "conclusive proof", "shall presume" and "may 
presume". The term "conclusive proof" specifies those presumptions which in English 
Law are called irrebuttable presumptions of law; the term "shall presume" indicates 
rebuttable presumptions of law; the term "may presume" indicates presumptions of fact. 
When we see a man knocked down by a speeding car and a few yards away, there is a 
car going, there is a presumption of fact that the car has knocked down the man. 
8. ESTOPPEL  
The general rule of estoppel is when one person has by his declaration, act or 
omission, intentionally caused or permitted another person to believe a thing to be 
true and to act upon such belief, neither he nor his representative shall be allowed, in 
any suit or proceeding between himself and such person or his representative to 
deny the truth of that thing (Section 115). However, there is no estoppel against the 
Statute. Where the Statute prescribes a particular way of doing something, it has to 
be done in that manner only. Other relevant Sections are Sections 116 and 117. 
Principle of Estoppel 
Estoppel is based on the maxim ‗allegans contratia non est audiendus‘ i.e. a 
person alleging contrary facts should not be heard. The principles of estoppel covers 
one kind of facts. It says that man cannot approbate and reprobate, or that a man 
cannot blow hot and cold, or that a man shall not say one thing at one time and later 
on say a different thing. 
The doctrine of estoppel is based on the principle that it would be most 
inequitable and unjust that if one person, by a representation made, or by conduct 
amounting to a representation, has induced another to act as he would not otherwise 
have done, the person who made the representation should not be allowed to deny or 
repudiate the effect of his former statement to the loss and injury of the person who 
acted on it (Sorat Chunder v. Gopal Chunder). 
Estoppel is a rule of evidence and does not give rise to a cause of action. 
Estoppel by record results from the judgement of a competent Court (Section 40, 41). 
It was laid down by the Privy Council in Mohori Bibee v. Dharmodas Ghosh, (1930) 
30 Cal. 530 PC, that the rule of estoppel does not apply where the statement is made 
to a person who knows the real facts represented and is not accordingly misled by it. 
The principle is that in such a case the conduct of the person seeking to invoke rule 
of estoppel is in no sense the effect of the representation made to him. The main 
determining element is not the effect of his representation or conduct as having 
induced another to act on the faith of such representation or conduct. 
In Biju Patnaik University of Tech. Orissa v. Sairam College, AIR 2010 (NOC) 
691 (Orissa), one private university permitted to conduct special examination of 
students prosecuting studies under one time approval policy. After inspection, 67 
students were permitted to appear in the examination and their results declared. 
However, university declined to issue degree certificates to the students on the 
ground that they had to appear for further examination for another condensed course 
 
 
EP-GCL-3

? 
as per syllabus of university. It was held that once students appeared in an 
examination and their results declared, the university is estopped from taking 
decision withholding degree certificate after declaration of results. 
There are different kinds of estoppel by conduct or estoppel in pais. They are: (a) 
estoppel by attestation (b) estoppel by contract (c) constructive estoppel (d) estoppel by 
election (e) equitable estoppel (f) estoppel by negligence, and (g) estoppel by silence.

LESSON ROUND-UP 
 
 
The expression ‗specific relief‘ means a relief in specie. It is a remedy which aims 
at the exact fulfillment of an obligation. 
 
The specific Relief Act applies both to movable and immovable property. The Act 
applies in cases where court can order specific performance of a contract or act. 
As per the Act, specific relief can be granted only for the purpose of enforcing 
individual civil rights and not for the mere purpose of enforcing a civil law. 
 
Arbitration is the means by which parties to a dispute get the same settled 
through the intervention of a third person (or more persons) but without recourse 
to a court of law.  
 
The purpose of Arbitration Act is to provide quick redressal to commercial 
disputes by private arbitration. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 aims at 
streamlining the process of arbitration and facilitating conciliation in business 
matters.  
 
The Act has been divided into four parts and contains three Schedules. Part one 
deals with Arbitration; Part two deals with enforcement of certain Foreign Awards; 
Part three deals with conciliation; and Part four contains supplementary 
provisions.  
 
Similarly schedule one contains provisions relating to convention on the 
Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards; Schedule two deals 
with Protocol on Arbitration Clauses and Schedule three contains provisions 
relating to Execution of Foreign Arbitral Awards. 
 
The present Act is based on model law drafted by United Nations Commission on 
International Trade Laws (UNCITRAL), both on domestic arbitration as well as 
EP-GCL-3 
202 
international commercial arbitration, to provide uniformity and certainty to both 
categories of cases. 
 
The essential purpose of a limitation period is to place a time limit on the period 
within which a party can commence legal proceedings. 
 
Limitation periods are imposed by statute, primarily the Limitation Act 1963. The 
Limitation Act provides different limitation periods for different types of suits. 
 
If a limitation period has expired for a particular claim, the claim will be "statute-
barred". This means that it will no longer be possible for the claimant to effect 
recovery for that claim against the alleged wrongdoer. 
 
The law of Evidence may be defined as a system of rules for ascertaining 
controverted questions of fact in judicial inquiries. This system of ascertaining the 
facts, which are the essential elements of a right or liability and is the primary and 
perhaps the most difficult function of the court, is regulated by a set of rules and 
principles known as law of Evidence‖. 
 
The word evidence in the Act signifies only the instruments by means of which 
relevant facts are brought before the court, viz., witnesses and documents, and 
by means of which the court is convinced of these facts. 
 
Evidence under the Act may be either oral or personal (i.e. all statements which 
the court permits or requires to be made before it by witnesses), and 
documentary (documents produced for the inspection of the court), which may be 
adduced in order to prove a certain fact (principal fact) which is in issue.  
 
‗Tort‘ means wrong. But every wrong or wrongful act is not a tort. Tort is really a 
kind of civil wrong as opposed to criminal wrong. Wrongs, in law, are either public 
or private. 
 
A tort consists of some act or omission done by the defendant (tortfeasor) 
whereby he has without just cause or excuse caused some harm to plaintiff. To 
constitute a tort, there must be: (i) a wrongful act or omission of the defendant;  
(ii) the wrongful act must result in causing legal damage to another; and (iii) the 
wrongful act must be of such a nature as to give rise to a legal remedy.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
The law relating to transfer of property is governed by the Transfer of Property 
Act, 1882. Before this Act came into force there was practically no law as to real 
property in India. Barring few points which were covered by certain Regulations and 
204 
 
EP-GCL-4 
205 
Acts, the Courts in India in the absence of any statutory provisions, applied rules of 
English law as the rule of justice, equity and good conscience. 
The Act was enacted with the object to amend the law relating to the transfer of 
property by act of parties. The Act excludes from its purview the transfers by 
operation of law, i.e. by sale in execution, forfeiture, insolvency or intestate 
succession. The scope of the Act is limited, as it is confined to transfers inter vivos 
and excludes testamentary succession, i.e. transfers by will. 
The very preamble to the Act suggests that it simply defines and amends 
certain parts of the law relating to transfer of property by act of parties, and it does 
not at all profess to be an exhaustive enactment as is revealed by the omission of 
the word “consolidate”. Therefore, the Act leaves the scope for applying rules of 
justice, equity and good conscience if a particular case is not covered by any of the 
provisions of the Act. But if it is covered, the Act must be applied.

2.  IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS 
However, while explaining the provisions of the Act, the terms used are defined 
there itself, yet some of the important terms used under the Act are as follows: 
Instrument  
"Instrument" means a non-testamentary instrument. 
EP-GCL-4 
206 
Attached to the earth 
It means : 
 (a) rooted in the earth, as in the case of trees and shrubs; 
 (b) imbedded in the earth, as in the case of walls or buildings; or 
 (c) attached to what is so embedded for the permanent beneficial enjoyment of 
that to which it is attached. 
Absolute Interest 
When a person owns property, he has an "absolute interest" in the property. 
Ownership consists of a bundle of rights, the right to possession, right to enjoyment 
and right to do anything such as selling, mortgaging or making gift of the property. If 
A is the owner of a land, he has an absolute interest in the land. If A sells his land 
to B, then B becomes the owner and he acquires an absolute interest in the land he 
has purchased from A. Likewise if A makes a gift of his property to B, there again B 
gets an absolute interest in the property which is gifted to him. These are instances 
where persons may have an absolute interest. 
Reversion and Remainder 
Some interests in the property are called in English Law, reversion and 
remainders. A "reversion" is the residue of an original interest which is left after the 
grantor has granted the lessee a small estate. For example, A, the owner of a land 
may lease it to B for a period of five years. The person who grants the lease is the 
lessor and the person who takes the lease is called the lessee. Here, after the 
period of 5 years the lease will come to an end and the property reverts back to the 
lessor. The property which reverts back to him is called the reversion or the 
reversionery interest. The grantor has a larger and an absolute interest out of which 
he carves out a smaller estate and gives to the grantee, i.e. the lessee. 
When the owner of the property grants a limited interst in favour of a person or 
persons and gives the remaining to others, it is called a "remainder". For instance, A 
the owner of a land transfers property to B for life and then to C absolutely. Here the 
interest in favour of B is a limited interest, i.e., it is only for life. So long as A is alive 
he enjoys the property. He has a limited right since he cannot sell away the property. 
His right is only to enjoy the property. If he sells this interest it will be valid so long as 
he is alive. So after B‟s death the property will go to C, interest is called a remainder. 
In the case of a "remainder", the property will not come back to the owner, but it goes 
over to the other person. 
Vested and Contingent Interests 
The word "vested" is used in two different senses. It may mean "vested in 
possession" or "vested in interest". A right is said to be "vested in possession" when it 
is a right to present possession of property and it is said to be "vested in interest" 
when it is not a right to present possession but a present right to future possession. 
For instance, if a land is given to A for life with a remainder to B, A‟s right is vested in 
possession, B‟s right is vested in interest. In the above example, the interest of B is 
not subject to any uncertain condition. It will come into his possession after A‟s life 
 
EP-GCL-4 
207 
comes to an end. Therefore, an interest is said to be vested when it is not subject to 
any condition, precedent, i.e., when it is to take effect on the happening of an event 
which is certain, whereas an estate is contingent when the right to enjoyment 
depends upon the happening of an event which may or may not happen. Thus, a gift 
to A on the death of B creates a vested interest in A even during the life time of B for 
there is nothing more certain than death. But a gift to A on the marriage of B creates 
a contingent interest, for B may never marry at all but that contingent interest 
becomes vested if and when B marries. 
A vested interest is transferable and heritable. If property is given to A for life and 
afterwards to B, B gets a vested interest and if B transfers this interest to C, C will 
take when the life estate of A comes to an end. B‟s interest, since it is vested, is also 
heritable. Therefore, if B dies during the lifetime of A, C will get the property after the 
death of A. 
A contingent interest, as said above, is an interest which takes effect after the 
condition is satisfied. It is subject to a condition precedent, i.e., unless A marries B‟s 
daughter, he will not get the property. The following example will illustrate this point. 
Property is given to A for life and then to B if he marries C. B should marry C before A 
dies. If he does so, his interest is converted into vested interest. Before B marries C 
his interest is contingent. The contingent interest is not heritable although it is 
transferable. In a vested interest the transfer is complete, but when the interest is 
contingent the transfer depends upon a condition precedent. In a condition precedent 
the estate is not vested in the grantee until the condition is fulfilled. 
Distinction between a vested and a contingent interest:  The following are the 
principal points of distinction between a vested and a contingent interest: 
 
1. When an interest is vested the transfer is complete. It creates an immediate 
proprietory interest in the property though the enjoyment may be postponed 
to a future date. A contingent interest on the other hand is dependant upon 
the fulfilment of some conditions which may or may not happen. In other 
words, in case of vested interest, the owner‟s title is already prefect; in case 
of a contingent interest, the title is as yet imperfect but may become perfect 
on the fulfilment of a stipulated condition. 
 
2. A vested interest takes effect from the date of transfer. A contingent interest 
in order to become vested is conditioned by a contingency which may not 
occur. 
 
3. A vested interest cannot be defeated by the death of the transferee before 
he obtains possession. A contingent interest may fail in case of the death of 
transferee before the fulfilment of condition. 
 
4. Since vested interest is not circumscribed by any limitation which derogates 
from the completeness of the grant, it logically follows that a vested interest 
is transferable as well as heritable. If, therefore, a transferee of the vested 
interest dies before actual enjoyment, it will devolve on his legal heirs. A 
contingent interest, on the other hand, cannot be inherited though it may be 
transferred coupled with limitation regarding fulfilment of a condition.

3.  MOVEABLE AND IMMOVEABLE PROPERTY 
The term “property” signifies the subject matter over which the right of ownership 
or any less right carved out of ownership (e.g. mortgage right) is exercised. The Act 
deals with (i) various specific transfers relating to Immoveable property and (ii) lays 
down general principles relating to transfer of both moveable and immoveable 
property. Chapter II of the Act is divided into two parts. Parts A deals with the rules 
pertaining to both moveable and immoveable property (Section 5 to 37), Part B 
embodies the rules relating to immoveable property (Section 38 to 53A). The other 
chapters of the Act deal with transfers such as sales, mortgages, leases, gifts, 
exchanges and actionable claims. The rules relating to these transactions are 
referred to as rules governing special transfers to immoveable property. The 
fundamental rule relating to all transfers is that a transfer cannot be effected in any 
other way except as prescribed under the Act. Furthermore, the Act states that 
certain kinds of property cannot be transferred at all. 
The first task is to define and distinguish between moveable and immoveable 
property. 
Moveable property 
The Transfer of Property Act does not defines the term "moveable property". 
Therefore, it is to be defined with the help of other statutes. For e.g., it has been 
defined in the General Clauses Act, 1897 as to mean “property of every description 
except immoveable property”. The Registration Act defines "moveable property" to 
include property of every description excluding immoveable property but including 
standing timber, growing crops and grass. 
For the purpose of law, moveable property is sometimes regarded as 
immoveable property. This may happen when a thing of chattel is attached or 
embedded in earth. For instance, if a machinery or a plant is installed on the land, the 
question arises whether the machinery or the plant is moveable property or 
immoveable property. In order to find out whether such a thing or chattel is an 
immoveable property or not, it is to find out the mode of annexation of the thing and 
the object or purpose of such annexation. If the machinery is fixed on the land 
permanently then it becomes immoveable property, whereas if the machinery or 
engine or any other thing is fixed on a temporary basis, then it will be regarded as 
moveable property. Thus, where the owner of a piece of land installed a bone mill 
 
EP-GCL-4 
209 
along with machinery being held by iron bars which have been dug to a considerable 
depth then it is a permanent fixture and this will become immoveable property. 
Similarly, the machinery installed on a cement platform and held in position by being 
attached to iron pillars fixed in the ground was held to be immoveable property as the 
annexation was made by the person who owned the buildings as well as the 
machinery (Mohamed Ibrahim v. Northern Circars Fibre Trading Company, A.I.R. 
1944 Mad. 492). 
Immoveable property 
The term “immoveable property” is also not defined under the Act. However, it is 
defined in the negative sense as “the immoveable property does not include standing 
timber, growing crops, or grass” (S. 3 Para 2). Standing timber are trees fit for use for 
building or repairing houses. This is an exception to the general rule that growing 
trees are immoveable property. 
Growing crops:  It includes all vegetable growths which have no existence apart 
form their produce such as pan leaves, sugar cane etc. 
Grass:  Grass is moveable property, but if it is a right to cut grass it would be an 
interest in land and hence forms immoveable property. 
The General Clauses Act defines the term "immoveable property" but not 
exhaustively. It states: “immoveable property shall include land, benefits to arise out 
of land and things attached to the earth, or permanently fastened to any thing 
attached to the earth” [Section 3(25)]. The Indian Registration Act expressly includes 
under to immoveable property the benefits to arise out of land, hereditary allowances, 
rights of way, lights, ferries and fisheries. 
If the definitions of "immoveable property" as given in the Transfer of Property 
Act, the General Clauses Act and the Registration Act are viewed together, it is 
evident that they do not say what immoveable property is. They only say what is 
either included or excluded therein. Still, reading the definition in the Act with one in 
the General Clauses Act, immoveable property will be found to include land, benefit 
to arise out of land such as rent, and things attached to the earth like trees and 
buildings but not standing timber, growing crops and grass. The last three things are 
regarded as severable from the land on which they stand and, therefore, they are not 
included in the term "immoveable property". 
Thus, the meaning of immoveable property is as under: 
"Immoveable property" means land, benefits to arise out of land, 
and things attached to the earth, or permanently fastened to anything 
attached to the earth. 
“Attached to the earth” means (a) rooted in the earth, as in the case of trees and 
shrubs; (b) embedded in the earth, as in the case of walls or buildings; or (c) attached 
to what is so embedded for the permanent beneficial enjoyment of that to which it is 
attached (S. 3 Para 6 of the Act). 
Things rooted in the earth:  Trees and Shrubs are immoveable property 
according to this definition subject to the exception as to standing timber. 
EP-GCL-4 
210 
Things embedded in the earth:  A house being embedded in the earth is 
immoveable property and this is so even if it is sold for enjoyment as a house with an 
option to pull it down. The mode of annexation and object of annexation are the two 
tests to determine whether it is immoveable property or not. 
Attached to what is so...:  The attachment must be as the Section says for the 
permanent beneficial enjoyment of that to which it is attached e.g. the doors, windows 
of a house or moveable parts of fixed machinery. But the attachment must be 
intended to be permanent. 
A orally grants to B for Rs. 700/- the rights to catch and carry away fish from his 
lake. Is the grant valid? The Supreme Court in Ananda Behra v. State of Orissa, 
(1956) SCJ p. 96, that such a right is a benefit arising out of immoveable property 
namely the lake. So under General Clauses Act it is immoveable property. The sale 
requires a registered instrument for its validity under Section 54 of the Transfer of 
Property Act. Therefore, the oral grant is invalid and cannot pass away any title in 
favour of B. 
Distinction between moveable and immoveable property 
The distinction between moveable and immoveable property was explained in 
the case of Sukry Kurdepa v. Goondakull, (1872) 6 Mad. H.C. 
71, by Holloway J. as moveability may be defined to be a 
capacity in a thing of suffering alteration. Immoveablity for 
such alteration e.g., a piece of land in all circumstances is 
immoveable. If a thing cannot change its place without 
injury to the quality it is immoveable. Certain things e.g. 
trees attached to the ground are so long as they are so 
attached, immoveable when the severance has been effected they become 
moveable. 
The following have been recognised as immoveable property: 
 (a) right to collect rents of immoveable property; 
 (b) a right to way; 
 (c) a right to collect dues from fair on a piece of land; 
 (d) hereditary offices; 
 (e) the equity of redemption; 
 
(f) the interest of mortgagee; 
 (g) right to collect lac from trees; 
 (h) a right of ferry; 
 
(i) a right of fishery; 
 
(j) right to receive future rents and profits of land; 
 (k) reversion in property leased; 
 
(l) a factory. 
The following have been held not to be immoveable property: 
 (a) right of worship; 
 
EP-GCL-4 
211 
? 
 (b) government promissory notes; 
 (c) royalty; 
 (d) a right to recover maintenance allowance; 
 (e) copyright; 
 
(f) a decree for sale on a mortgage-deed; 
 (g) a decree for arrears of rent; 
 (h) a machinery which is not permanently attached to earth; 
 
(i) standing timber, growing crop and grass.

 (b) Standing timber 
 (c) Growing crops 
 (d) Grass 
Correct Answer: (b), (c) and (d) 
 
4. RULES RELATING TO TRANSFER OF PROPERTY (WHETHER MOVEABLE 
OR IMMOVEABLE) 
According to Section 5 of the Transfer of Property Act, the term “transfer of 
property” means an act by which a living person conveys property in present, or in 
future, to one or more other living persons, or to himself, and one or more other living 
persons and "to transfer property" is to perform such an act. In this section, "living 
person" includes a company or association or body of individuals whether 
incorporated or not. But the general provisions of the Act as to transfer do not effect 
the special provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. 
To effect a transfer, property must be in existence. The word “transfer” is defined 
with reference to the word “convey”. The fundamental rule is that a transfer cannot be 
affected in any way not prescribed by the Act. 
The first point to note is that transfer inter vivos (i.e., between living persons) 
alone is contemplated by the Act. A transfer by means of a will is not a transfer 
according to the Act, because it is not a transfer between two living persons. Section 
5 also says that the transfer may be “in present or in future”. The words in present or 
in future qualify the words „conveys‟, and not the word „property‟. A transfer of 
property not in existence operates as a contract to be performed in future 
which may be specially enforced as soon as the property comes into existence 
(Jugalkishore v. Ram Cotton Company, (1955) I SCR 1369). 
Further Section 6 (h) provides that no transfer can be made in so far as it is 
opposed to the nature of the interest attached thereby or for an unlawful object or 
consideration or to a person legally disqualified to be a transferee. 
EP-GCL-4 
212 
5.  WHO CAN TRANSFER THE PROPERTY? 
According to Section 7 of the Transfer of Property Act, every person who is 
competent to contract and entitled to transferable property, or authorised to dispose 
of property is competent to transfer such property. Hence, every person competent to 
contract and having ownership can trasnfer property. According to Indian Contract 
Act, a person is competent to contract when he is a major and of sound mind and is 
not disqualified from contracting by any law to which he is subject. But a minor can be 
a transferee as there is nothing in the Transfer of Property Act to disqualify a person, 
who is a minor to be a transferee. Thus, a mortgage can be validly executed in favour 
of a minor who has paid the consideration (Hari Mohan v. Mohini, 22 C.W.C. 130, 
Raghava v. Srinivasa, (1917) 60 Mad. 308). Persons who are authorised to transfer 
property can also transfer property validly. Although a minor is not competent to be a 
transferor yet a transfer to a minor is valid. However, there are exceptions to this: 
If a person holds himself out is the owner with the consent of the owner i.e. 
doctrine of holding out or if a person represents to be the owner i.e. doctrine of 
feeding the grant by estoppel. 
6.  SUBJECT MATTER OF TRANSFER 
Section 6 of the Transfer of Property Act says that property of any kind may be 
transferred except as provided by this Act or any other law for the time being in force. 
The words “property of any kind” indicate that transferability is the general rule and 
the right to property includes the right to transfer the property to another person. 
Property of any kind excludes from its purview the future property. A transfer of future 
property can only operate as a contract which may be specifically performed when 
the property comes into existence. 
Exceptions to the general rule of transferability made by other laws 
Certain restrictions are placed by Hindu law and Mohammedan law on the 
transfer of property. 
7.  FORMALITIES OF TRANSFER 
Property can be transferred either orally or by writing. Moveable property can be 
transferred by delivery of possession or by registration. Section 54 lays down the 
mode of transfer of immoveable property. Such transfer, in the case of tangible 
immoveable property of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards, or in the case 
of a reversion or other intangible thing, can be made only by a registered instrument. 
In the case of tangible immoveable property of a value less than one hundred 
rupees, such transfer may be made either by a registred instrument or by delivery of 
the property. 
The tangible property means a property which can be touched physically and 
hence, capable of physical dealing. 
The intangible property means something in abstract, either capable of being 
touched or perceived and yet standing in relation to a certain thing. 
„Reversion‟ means the bundle of rights remaining with the lessor after the 
execution of a lease of a certain immoveable property. 
 
EP-GCL-4 
213 
When a transfer is effected in writing, the person who signs the document 
professing to transfer the property is called the executant. Execution consists in 
affixing his signature to the document to the effect that he is transferring the property. 
An illiterate person who cannot write may direct some literate person to sign it on his 
behalf and in his presence and the illiterate person may put his thumb impression. 
(i)  Attestation 
Attestation is an important formality in connection with the execution of transfer. 
"Attest" means to testify a factor, to bear witness to a fact. Attestation, in relation to a 
document, signifies the fact of authentication of the signature of the executant of that 
document by the attestator by putting down his own signature on the document in 
testimony of the fact of its execution. All transfers do not require attestation. For 
example, a sale or a lease does not require attestation. But a mortgage or a gift 
requires that a mortgage deed or a gift deed must be attested by two or more 
witnesses. 
Attestation is valid and complete when two witnesses sign the instrument. 
According to the definition given in the Transfer of Property Act (Section 3), the 
following essentials are required for a valid attestation: 
 (a) There must be at least two or more witnesses; 
 (b) Each witness must see (a) the executant‟s sign or affix his mark to the 
instrument, or (b) some other person sign the instrument in the presence 
and by the direction of the executant, or (c) receive from the executant a 
personal acknowledgement of his signature or mark or of the signature of 
such other person; and 
 (c) Each witness must sign the instrument, (i.e. document), in the presence of 
the executant. 
It is not necessary that both attesting witnesses should be present at the same 
time. The instrument may be attested after its execution by each of the attestators at 
different times. Attestation cannot take place before the execution of the deed. The 
Act does not insist on any particular form of attestation. The attesting witness may not 
be described as such on the face of the document (Yakub v. Kalzurkan, 52 Bombay 
203). However, the attesting witness must have put his signature antmus attestandi, 
i.e., with intention to attest. Thus, where a Register or an identifying witness puts his 
signature on the document he cannot be regarded as an attesting witness unless it is 
duly proved that he signed with the necessary intention to attest. 
(ii)  Registration 
Registration is an essential legal formality to effect a valid transfer in certain 
cases. The advantage of registering a document is that any person who deals with 
the property would be bound by the rights that are created in earlier registered 
document. 
Illustration 
A executes a mortgage on property X and gets it registered. Subsequently he 
sells property X to B, B is bound by the right of the mortgagee over the property X. 
Thus, whether B knows actually or not that there was a mortgage the fact that the 
EP-GCL-4 
214 
earlier document was registered is a notice to B and B takes property, subject to the 
rights of the mortgagee. Therefore, if a document of transfer relating to immoveable 
property is required by the law to be and has been effected by registered instrument, 
the persons who deal with the property subsequently are deemed in the eye of law as 
having knowledge of the such registered instrument from the date of its registration. 
(iii)  Notice 
Notice, may be actual or constructive. If a person knows about a fact, he has an 
actual notice. But, in certain circumstances law treats a man who ought to have 
known a fact even though he did not in fact know it. This is called constructive notice. 
The equitable doctrine of notice is recognised in various Sections of this Act. For 
instance in Section 39 of the Act, where a transfer is made of property out of which a 
person has a right to receive maintenance, the transferee takes subject to that right if 
he had notice of it, but not otherwise. Similarly under Section 40 if A conveys to C 
property, which he had by a previous contract agreed to sell to B, then B can enforce 
the contract against C, if C had notice of it, but not otherwise. If C had notice of the 
prior contract, he purchases with knowledge that it was unconscionable of A to sell to 
him, and it is therefore, unconscionable of him to buy. 
A person is deemed in the eye of law to have constructive notice of a fact when 
(i) but for willful absentation from an enquiry or search which he ought reasonably to 
have made; or (ii) gross negligence on his part, he would have known it. Constructive 
notice arises from an irrefutable presumption of notice. In law such a presumption will 
arise when (i) there is a willful absentation on the part of a person to make necessary 
enquiries regarding the existence of certain facts, or (ii) he showed gross negligence 
in the matter. 
The words “wilful absentation” suggest want of bona fide in respect of 
particular transaction (Joshua v. Alliance Bank, 22 Cal. 185). Thus, a person 
who refuses to receive a registered letter is, deemed to have constructive 
notice of its contents. 
Similarly, if a person proposes to sell his property to X who, at the same time 
knows that rents due in respect of the property are paid by the tenants to a third person 
Y, X will be fixed with notice of the rights of Y (Mernt v. Luck (1902) 1 Ch. 429). 
In so far as gross negligence is concerned, it does not mean a mere 
carelessness but means carelessness of such an aggravated nature as to indicate 
mental indifference to obvious risks. For example, if A buys property from B and does 
not care to ask whether any amount by way of municipal tax is due on that property 
and if the municipal corporation asks him to pay the arrears of tax, then B is 
responsible, and if he does not pay, then the arrears of tax may be made a charge on 
the property. 
Other Illustrations 
 (a) Where a purchaser was informed that the title deeds were in the 
possession of a bank for safe custody and yet failed to make any enquiry in 
the bank. It was held that he was guilty of gross negligence and must be 
deemed to have notice of the rights of the bank which has the custody of 
the title needs (Imperial Bank of India v. Rai Gyand, I A 283). 
 
EP-GCL-4

? 
 (b) Where a person abstained from making further enquiries about the right of 
a person and did not cause a search, to be made in the office of the Sub-
Registrar to ascertain if there was any encumbrance over the property, his 
omission must be held to be wilful or grossly negligent and he would be 
said to have notice of the prior encumbrances (Rangappa Goundan v. 
Marapa Goundan, AIR (1958) Madras 515). 
The three Explanations to the definition of notice in Section 3, further mention 
certain circumstances wherein statutorily presumption of knowledge arises. These 
circumstances relate to the fact of registration (Explanation-I, Explanation-II) actual 
possession and notice to an agent (Explanation-III).

8.  RESTRAINT ON TRANSFERS OR RULE AGAINST INALIENABILITY 
Section 10 of the Act says that when property is transferred, the transferee 
should not be restrained absolutely from alienating the property. One may give 
property to another subject to a condition, but the condition should not be one which 
absolutely prevents the transferee from alienating the property. Suppose, B gives 
property to A and his heirs adding a condition that if the property is alienated it should 
revert to B. This condition is invalid and the transferee can ignore such condition. The 
transfer takes effect and is valid, and the condition not to alienate the property is void. 
Examples of absolute restraint 
Suppose, A gives to B property worth only 2,000 rupees and adds a condition 
that B should sell property for Rs. 50,000 and not below that amount, this condition 
will at once become invalid for no one will buy the property which is only worth Rs. 
2,000 for Rs. 50,000. Similarly, A gives to B property worth Rs. 50,000 and stipulates 
that if B wants to sell the property he should sell it to C only for Rs. 1,000. This again 
will operate as an absolute restraint. In Rosher v. Rosher, (1884) 26, Ch. D. 801, the 
testator gave his estate to his son and added a condition that if his son wanted to sell 
the property he should first give an option to the testator‟s wife who should be able to 
buy for £ 3,000. The market value of the property when the testator died was £ 
15,000. It was held by the Court that the condition which compelled the son to sell the 
property for £ 3,000 was void. In Trichinpoly Varthaga Sangum v. Shunmoga 
Sunderam, (1939) Madras 954, there was a partition between a Hindu father and 
his five sons. The deed of partition provided that if any one of the sons wanted 
to sell his share, he should not sell it to a stranger but to one of his brothers 
who should have the option to buy for a sum not exceeding Rs. 1,000. It was 
held by the Court that the condition absolutely prevented the son from selling 
the property to any one for good value. In this case the market value of the 
EP-GCL-4 
216 
property of the son was far greater than Rs. 1,000. Hence, the condition was 
declared invalid. 
Partial restraint valid 
Though absolute restraints are bad in law, partial restraints are valid. If there are 
conditions which restrain the transferee not to alienate the property outside the 
family, it has been held by the Courts that they are partial restraints. For example, 
whenever there are conditions in a family settlement whereby the members are not 
allowed to sell their shares to a stranger, such conditions are valid. 
But it is not permissible to restrict the alienation to a particular time. Such a 
restriction is not partial but an absolute restraint and as such invalid. 
When absolute restraint valid? 
There are two exceptions to the rule that absolute restraints are void. Firstly, in 
the case of a lease, the lessor can impose a condition that the lessee shall not sublet 
the property or sell his leasehold interest. Such conditions are valid. The reason why 
such an exception is made in the case of a lease is that the lessor may have 
confidence in the lessee but may not have the same confidence in some other 
person. So, if the lessor puts a condition restraining the lessee from transferring the 
property to someone, the condition is valid. 
The second exception is made in respect of a woman who is not a Hindu, 
Buddhist or Muslim. In such a case, a condition to the effect that she shall not have 
power during her marriage to transfer the property is valid. 
Restraint on enjoyment 
Section 11 of the Act also embodies a rule which is based on the principle that 
restraint on the enjoyment of the property is invalid. The section lays down that where 
land is transferred by one to another, the transferor should not impose conditions as 
to how and in what manner the transferee should enjoy the property. 
Illustrations 
(a) A sells his house to B and adds a condition that B only should reside in that 
house, the condition is invalid. This is subject to the exception that, if a person 
transfers a plot of land keeping another plot for himself, he can impose certain 
conditions which may interfere with the right of enjoyment of the transferee. 
(b) A has properties X and Y. He sells property Y to B and puts a condition that 
B should not construct on property Y more than one storey so that A‟s property X 
which he retains should have good light and free air. 
Thus, it is clear in the above illustration that the condition which is imposed by A 
is for the benefit of another property which he retains. Such a condition is valid. 
Section 12 also makes the transfer void if a property is transferred to any person 
adding a condition that if such person becomes insolvent he ceases to hold that 
property. Such a condition is not recognised as valid in law. Again, this is subject to 
the exception that if a landlord leases his property he can impose a condition on the 
lessee that if the lessee becomes insolvent the lease should come to an end.

9.  TRANSFER FOR BENEFIT OF UNBORN PERSON 
Section 13 of the Transfer of Property Act lays down that where on a transfer of 
property, an interest therein is created for the benefit of a person not in existence at 
the date of transfer, subject to a prior interest created by the same transfer, the 
interest created for the benefit of such person shall not take effect unless it extends to 
the whole of the remaining interest of the transferor in the property. Thus if a property 
is given to an unborn person, two conditions should be satisfied: 
 
(i) it should be preceded by a life estate in favour of a living person, and 
 (ii) it should comprise the whole of the remaining interest of the transferor so 
that there can be no further interest in favour of others. 
Illustration 
A transfers property of which he is the owner to B in trust for A and his intended 
wife successively for their lives, and after the death of the survivor, for the eldest son 
of the intended marriage for life, and after his death for A‟s second son. The interest 
so created for the benefit of the eldest son does not take effect, because it does not 
extend to the whole of A‟s remaining interest in the property.

10.  CONDITIONAL TRANSFER 
When an interest is created on the transfer of property but is made to depend on 
the fulfillment of a condition by the transferee, the transfer is known as a conditional 
transfer. Such a transfer may be subject to a condition precedent or a condition 
subsequent. If the interest is made to accrue on the fulfilment of a condition, the 
condition is said to be condition precedent. For instance, A agrees to sell his land to 
B if B marries C. This is a condition precedent. The condition precedent will be 
allowed to operate only if it is not hit by the provisions of Section 25 of the Act. 
Section 25 in the first place, says that, the condition must not be impossible to fulfil. 
For example, A lets a farm to B on condition that he shall walk a hundred miles in an 
hour. The lease is void. Secondly, the condition must not be forbidden by law. Thirdly, 
it should not be of such a nature that if permitted it would defeat the provisions of any 
law. For instance, A transfers Rs. 500 to B on condition that he shall murder C. The 
transfer is void. Fourthly, it should not be fraudulent. For example, X gives a false 
EP-GCL-4 
218 
receipt to Y on behalf of his principal in consideration of transfer of land. The transfer 
would be void. Fifthly, the condition should not be such as to cause injury to the 
person or property of another. And lastly the condition should not be immoral or 
opposed to public policy. Thus, an agreement to give a son or daughter in adoption 
for a consideration is opposed to public policy as trafficking in children is forbidden by 
law. 
If the condition is not hit by any of the above provisions, it is valid. Still the law 
does not insist on its literal fulfilment. It is sufficient if it is substantially complied with. 
Thus, where A transfers, Rs. 5,000 to B on condition that he shall marry with the 
consent of C, D and E. B marries with the consent of C and D only as E has died 
earlier. B is deemed to have fulfilled the condition. 
A transfer may also be made subject to a contingency which may or may not 
occur. Thus, an interest may be created with the condition superadded that it shall 
cease to exist in case a specified uncertain event shall happen, or in case a specified 
uncertain event shall not happen. 
This is known as condition subsequent. Condition subsequent is one which 
destroys or divests the rights upon the happening or non-happening of an event. For 
example, A transfers a farm to B for his life with a proviso that in case B cuts down a 
certain wood, the transfer shall cease to have any effect. B cuts down the wood. He 
loses his life interest in the farm. Similarly, if A transfers a farm to B provided that B 
shall not go to England within three years after the date of transfer, the interest in the 
farm shall cease. B does not go to England within the term prescribed. His interest in 
the farm ceases. 
Now you will notice the distinction between condition precedent and condition 
subsequent. In condition precedent, the condition comes before the interest; whereas 
in condition subsequent, the interest is created before the condition. The one 
precedes the vesting of right and the other follows the vesting. In condition precedent, 
the vesting of right is delayed until the happening of an event. In condition 
subsequent, there is no postponement of vesting of right though it is to be destroyed 
or divested by reason of non-fulfilment of condition. There are certain situations 
where the law says that either the transfer will take effect on the fulfillment of a 
condition or will not take effect at all. 
Again, if a transfer is made to defeat or delay the rights of a creditor, the transfer 
may be declared invalid by the creditor. In some cases, if property is transferred 
during the period when parties are litigating in a Court over a piece of property, then 
the transfer is not valid, or even if there is a transfer, it is subject to the rights that are 
created in the Court‟s decree. All these circumstances are given in the Transfer of 
Property Act e.g., doctrine of election, doctrine of fraudulent transfers and doctrine of 
Lis pendens. 
11.  DOCTRINE OF ELECTION 
Section 35 of the Transfer of Property Act deals with what is called doctrine of 
election. Suppose, a property is given to you and in the same deed of gift you are 
asked to transfer something belonging to you to another person. If you want to take 
the property you should transfer your property to someone else, otherwise you 
cannot take the property which is transferred to you by some one. Election may be 
 
EP-GCL-4 
219 
defined as “the choosing between two rights where there is a clear intention that both 
were not intended to be enjoyed”. 
The foundation of doctrine of election is that a person taking the benefit of 
an instrument must also bear the burden, and he must not take under and 
against the same instrument. It is, therefore, a branch of a general rule that no 
one may approbate and reprobate (Copper v. Copper (1874) H.L. 53). However 
doctrine of election could not be applied to deprive a person of his statutory 
right to appear invoking extraordinary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under 
Article 136, (PR Deshpande v. MB Haribatti (1995 (2) Scale 804 SC). 
Illustration 
A transfers to you his paddy field and in the same deed of transfer asks you to 
transfer your house to C. Now, if you want to have the paddy field you must transfer 
your house to C, because the transferor is transferring to you his paddy field on the 
condition that you give your house to C. 
Thus, either you take the paddy field and part with your house or do not take it at 
all. This is called the doctrine of election. You must elect either to take under the 
instrument, in which case you will have to fulfil the condition and bear the burden 
imposed upon you or you must elect against the instrument, in which case neither the 
benefit nor the burden will come to you. The doctrine is based on the principle that “a 
donee shall not be allowed to approbate and reprobate and that if he approbates, he 
shall do all in his power to confirm the instrument which he approbates” (Cavendish v. 
Decre 31 C.D. 466). 
In case, the person upon whom benefit is conferred rejects it, the property which 
was attempted to be transferred to him will revert to the transferor and it is he who will 
compensate the disappointed person. If the transferor dies before the person upon 
whom the benefit is conferred and he rejects the transfer, then the representatives of 
the transferor will have to satisfy the disappointed person out of the property which 
was the subject of transfer. 
Explanation of the above principle 
A transfers his property worth Rs. 1,000 and by the same instrument asks B to 
transfer his property worth Rs. 500 to C. Here, if B does not accept, he will not take 
A‟s property and the property will revert to A. If A is alive, it is for him to give some 
property to C. But if A dies before B has made his election then the heirs of A have to 
compensate C from A‟s property to the extent of Rs. 500. (You will note that B‟s 
property worth Rs. 500 was intended by A to be transferred to C). 
The question of Election arises only when a transfer is made by the same 
document. If the transferor makes a gift of property by one deed and by another asks 
the donee to part with his own property then there is no question of election. 
Illustration 
A transfers his land to B by a document. A by another document transfers B‟s 
property to C. In this case B can retain the property given to him and refuse to 
transfer his property to C as the two transfers do not form part of the same document. 
EP-GCL-4 
220 
? 
Further, the doctrine of election is applicable if the benefit is given directly. A 
person taking no benefit directly under a transaction but deriving a benefit under it 
indirectly need not elect. 
Illustration 
A transfers his property to B‟s son and by the same instrument transfer B‟s 
property to C. In this case B need not to elect and can keep his property. His son can 
have his gift. 
There is, however, an exception to the doctrine of election. That is, if the 
transferor gives two benefits to a person and one particular benefit is in lieu of an 
item of property belonging to that person which the transferor has asked to transfer to 
a third-party then if the person elects to retain his property, he can retain the other 
benefit. 
Illustration 
Under A‟s marriage settlement, his wife is entitled, if she survives him to the 
enjoyment of the estate of Sultanpur during her life. A by his will bequeaths to his wife 
an annuity of Rs. 200 p.m. during her life, in lieu of her interest in the estate of 
Sultanpur, which estates he bequeaths to his son. A also gives his wife a legacy of 
Rs. 1,000. After the death of A, his widow elects to take what she is entitled to take 
under the marriage settlement (i.e., the enjoyment of estate of Sultanpur). In this 
case, the wife has to forfeit the claim of Rs. 200 which her husband has given to her. 
But she can claim other benefit i.e., Rs. 1,000. 
Election may be express or implied by conduct. 
Illustration 
A transfers to B an estate to which C is entitled, and as part of the same 
transaction gives C a coal mine. C takes possession of the mine and exhausts it. He 
has thereby confirmed the transfer. 
In case of disability, the condition shall be postponed until the disability ceases, 
or until the election is made by some competent authority.

12.  TRANSFER BY OSTENSIBLE OWNER OR DOCTRINE OF HOLDING OUT 
Where, with the consent, express or implied, of the persons interested in 
immoveable property, a person is the ostensible owner of such property and transfers 
the same for consideration, the transfer shall not be voidable on the ground that the 
transferor was not authorised to make it, provided that the transferee, after taking 
reasonable care to ascertain that the transferor had power to make the transfer, has 
acted in good faith. (Section 41) 
 
EP-GCL-4 
221 
The following conditions are necessary for the application of Section 41: 
 
(i) the transferor is the ostensible owner; 
 (ii) he is so by the consent, express or implied, of the real owner; 
 (iii) the transfer is for consideration, and 
 (iv) the transferee has acted in good faith taking reasonable care to ascertain 
that the transferor had power to transfer. 
If any one of these elements is absent, the transferee is not entitled to the 
protection of this section. 
This Section is a statutory application of the law of estoppel. The section makes 
an exception to the rule that a person cannot confer a better title than he has. An 
ostensible owner is one who has all the indicia of ownership without being the real 
owner. 
Illustrations 
 (a) A made a gift of property to B but continued in possession of the gifted 
property. He purported to exercise a power of revocation and then 
transferred the property to the defendant. The gift, however, was not 
revocable as it was an unconditional gift. B seeks to recover possession 
from the defendant. The defendant invoked protection under Section 41.  
 
 In the given example, the donor is not an „ostensible owner‟ holding the 
property with the consent of the real owner. The defendant cannot, 
therefore, invoke the protection of Section 41. 
 (b) The manager of a joint Hindu family consisting of some minor members 
alienated the ancestral house to P without any necessity and the alienee 
transferred it to the defendants. The minors challenged the alienation. The 
defendants sought protection under Section 41. 
Here Section 41 has no application for “P was not the ostensible owner of the 
ancestral family house with the consent, express or, implied, of the persons 
interested in the said ancestral house in as much as the plaintiff, who had an interest 
in the said house, did not and could not by reason of the disability of infancy give their 
consent”. 
13.  DOCTRINE OF FEEDING THE GRANT BY ESTOPPEL 
Where, a person fraudulently or erroneously represents that he is authorised to 
transfer certain immoveable property and professes to transfer such property for 
consideration, such transfer shall, at the option of the transferee, operate on any 
interest which the transferor may acquire in such property at any time during which 
the contract of transfer subsists. (Section 43) 
Nothing in this Section shall impair the right of transferees in good faith for 
consideration without notice of the existence of the said option. 
Essentials: In order to invoke this section, the transferee must prove that: 
 
1. there was a representation, fraudulent or erroneous; 
 
2. it was to the effect that the transferor is entitled to transfer the immoveable 
property; 
EP-GCL-4 
222 
 
3. the transferor is found to have subsequently acquired the interest which he 
professed to transfer; 
 
4. the transfer of property was for consideration; 
 
5. the transferee has not rescinded the contract; 
 
6. the transferee acted in good-faith for consideration and without notice of the 
rights under the prior transfer. 
Illustration 
A, a Hindu, who has separated from his father B, sells to C three fields, X, Y and 
Z, representing that A is authorised to transfer the same. Of these fields, Z does not 
belong to A, it having been retained by B on the partition, but on B‟s dying, A as heir 
obtains Z. C, not having rescinded the contract of sale may require A to deliver Z to 
him. Thus, where a grantor has purported to grant an interest in land which he did not 
at that time possess, but subsequently acquires, the benefit of his subsequent 
acquisition goes automatically to the earlier grantee or as it usually expressed, feeds 
the estoppel. 
14.  DOCTRINE OF FRAUDULENT TRANSFER 
Where a person transfers his property so that his creditors shall not have 
anything out of the property, the transfer is called a fraudulent transfer. A debtor in 
order to defeat or delay the rights of a creditor, may transfer his property to some 
person, who may be his relative or a friend. The law does not allow this. Section 53 
embodies the principle. It states : 
“Every transfer of immoveable property made with intent to defeat or delay the 
creditors of the transferor shall be voidable at the option of any creditor so 
defeated or delayed.” 
Thus, where an owner of the property contracts a debt and then transfers his 
property to someone so that the creditor cannot proceed against the property to 
realise his debt, such a transfer is voidable at the option of the creditor. The transfer 
is valid so long as the creditor does not challenge it in a Court of law and gets a 
declaration that the transfer is invalid. A suit instituted by a creditor to avoid a transfer 
on the ground that it has been made with intent to defeat or delay the creditors of the 
transfer or shall be instituted on behalf of, or for the benefit of all the creditors. Once 
the creditor sues the debtor and says that the debtor has the intention to deceive him, 
the transfer can be declared invalid by the Court. The creditor has to satisfy the Court 
that there was an intention on the part of the debtor to defeat his rights. If he does not 
prove this, then the creditor will fail and the transfer is valid. The question arises as to 
when we can say that the transferor has the necessary intention to defeat the claim of 
the creditor. This can be gathered from the surrounding circumstances. Suppose a 
man takes a loan from the creditor. He does not pay the loan. Then the creditor sues 
him in a Court to get back his debt. On seeing this the debtor transfers his property to 
a friend of his or some other person who simply holds the property on behalf of the 
transferor. Again, the debtor may make a gift of his property to his wife or sell it to a 
friend who will afterwards retransfer the same to the transferor. Under these 
circumstances, we can easily say that the debtor‟s intention was to prevent the 
creditor from taking the property by a suit in the Court and to realise his debt. 
 
EP-GCL-4 
223 
But suppose the debtor has several creditors and he transfers his property to one 
of his creditors in satisfaction of his whole debt to him. Is this also a fraudulent 
transfer? The answer is No. For a mere preference of one creditor over the others is 
not fraudulent under the Section, even if the whole property is so transferred and 
nothing is left for the other creditors. But the other creditors may file a petition in the 
Court within three months of the transfer praying that the debtor be declared 
insolvent. If the debtor is adjudicated an insolvent, their interest will be protected and 
the transfer will be declared as fraudulent preference. The transfer will be set aside 
and the property will be distributed among all the creditors. 
However, under Section 53(2) the rights of a transferee in good-faith and for 
consideration are protected. It says nothing shall affect or impair the rights of a 
transferee in good-faith and for consideration. 
15.  DOCTRINE OF PART-PERFORMANCE 
Lastly, we may also discuss briefly the doctrine of part-performance which is 
embodied in Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act. 
A contract for the sale of land has been entered into between A and B. The 
transferee has paid the price entering into possession and is willing to carry out his 
contractual obligations. As registration has not been effected A, the transferor, seeks 
to evict B from the land. Can he do so? No, B will not be allowed to suffer simply 
because the formality of registration has not been through. The legislature grants 
some relief to such a transferee under Section 53A, which embodies the doctrine of 
part-performance. 
The rule did not exist on the statute book before 1929. Section 53A, 
was inserted by an amendment to the Act in 1929. Followings are the 
essential conditions for the operation of the doctrine of part-
performance according to Section 53A. 
 
1. There must be a contract to transfer immoveable property. 
 
2. It must be for consideration. 
 
3. The contract should be in writing and signed by the transferor himself or on 
his behalf. 
 
4. The terms necessary to constitute the transfer must be ascertainable with 
reasonable certainty from the contract itself. 
 
5. The transferee should have taken the possession of the property in part 
performance of the contract. In case he is already in possession, he must 
have continued in possession in part performance of the contract and must 
have done something in furtherance of the contract. 
 
6. The transferee must have fulfilled or ready to fulfill his part of the obligation 
under the contract. 
If all the abovementioned conditions are satisfied, then, the transferor and the 
persons claiming under him are debarred form exercising any right in relation to the 
property other than the rights expressly provided by the terms of the contract 
notwithstanding the fact that the instrument of transfer has not been registered or 
complete in the manner prescribed therefor by the law for time being in force. It 
EP-GCL-4 
224 
? 
should be noted that Section 53A does not confer any positive right on the transferee. 
It only prohibits exercise of the right of ownership in relation to the property in order to 
evict the transferee from the property because legal requirements have not been 
satisfied. 
However, the doctrine of part-performance will not affect the right of a 
subsequent transferee for consideration without notice of the earlier contract and of 
its being partly performed. 
The right conferred by this section is a right only available to a defendant to 
protect his possession. This section does not create a title on the defendant. It 
merely operates as a bar to the plaintiff asserting his title. It 
is limited to cases where the transferee had taken 
possession, and against whom the transferor is debarred 
from enforcing any right other than that expressly provided 
by the contract. The section imposes a bar on the 
transferor. When the conditions mentioned in the sections 
are fulfilled, it debars him from enforcing against the 
transferee any right or interest expressly provided by the contract. So far as 
the tranferee is concerned, the section confers a right on him to the extent it 
imposes a bar on the transferor (Delhi Motor Co. v. Basurkas, (1968) SCR 720). 
The English rules as to what acts constitute part-performance have been 
generally followed in India. These rules are as follows: 
 (1) An act of part-performance must be an act done in performance of the 
contract. An act introductory to and previous to the agreement, cannot 
therefore, be act of part-performance. 
 (2) The acts relied upon must be unequivocally and referable to no other 
contract than that alleged. 
 (3) An act of part-performance must be the act of the party seeking to avail 
himself of the equity.

16.  PROPERTIES WHICH CANNOT BE TRANSFERRED 
Section 6 of this Act contains some exceptions to the general rule that property of 
any kind may be transferred. Consequently, the following properties cannot be 
transferred, namely: 
 (a) the chance of an heir apparent succeeding to an estate, the chance of a 
relation obtaining a legacy on the death of a kinsman or any other mere 
possibility of a like nature cannot be transferred. 
 
EP-GCL-4 
225 
 (b) A mere right of re-entry for breach of a condition subsequent cannot be 
transferred to any one except the owner of the property affected thereby. 
 (c) An easement cannot be transfered apart from the dominant heritage. 
 (d) An interest is property restricted in its enjoyment to the owner personally 
cannot be transferred by him. 
 (e) A right to future maintenance in whatsoever manner arising, secured or 
determined, cannot be transferred. 
 
(f) A mere right to sue cannot be transferred. 
 (g) A public office cannot be transferred nor can the salary of a public officer, 
whether before or after it has become payable. 
 (h) Stipends allowed to military, naval, air force and civil pensioners of the 
Government and political pensions cannot be transferred. 
(a)  Chance of an heir apparent or „Spes Successionis‟ 
In this clause possibilities referred are bare or naked possibilities and not coupled 
with an interest such as contingent remainders or future interest-also known as right 
of spes successionis which cannot be the subject to transfer. 
When a person is the owner of property, the property is in existence and it is in 
his possession. This he may transfer. But if property is neither in existence nor is the 
person the owner of the property then it cannot be transferred. For example, if a 
person is intending to buy certain property but, he has no interest in that property, he 
cannot transfer it unless the property comes to his hands, i.e., unless he becomes the 
owner of the property after buying it. But if a person obtains certain consideration and 
agrees to sell the property of which he is not the owner, then on becoming the actual 
owner of the property he has to transfer the property as there was a contract between 
him and the person who has agreed to buy the property. This transfer operates on a 
contract to be performed when the property comes into the hands of the person who 
has agreed to transfer. But where a person wants to make a gift of the property which 
is to come in his hands in future, he cannot transfer it because a gift is voluntary 
transfer without any consideration. Thus a gift of future property is void. Similarly, the 
chance of a heir apparent succeeding to the estate of a deceased person cannot be 
transferred. Suppose A is the owner of the property and B is his son. B is the heir of 
A. During the life time of his father A, B has only a hope expectancy that he will 
inherit the property of his father. This type of property which B hopes to get after the 
death of the father cannot be transferred, during the life time of A. 
Illustrations:  
(a) Suppose A, a Hindu who has separate property, dies leaving a widow W and 
a brother L, L‟s succession to the property is dependent upon two factors, viz., (i) his 
surviving the widow, W, and (ii) W leaving the property intact. L has only a bare 
chance of succession to the property left by A. This is spes successionis, and 
therefore, cannot be transferred (Amrit Narayana v. Gyan Singh, (1918) 45 Cal. 690). 
(b) A transfers to B for valuable consideration his reversionary interest in a 
property. When A succeeds to the property, B sues him for possession of the same. 
B will not succeed as the reversionary interest is a spes successionis and non-
transferable. So the transfer is void and B‟s suit for possession fails. 
EP-GCL-4 
226 
(b)  Right of re-entry 
The right which the lessor has against the lessee for breach of an express 
condition which provides that on its breach the lessor may re-enter is called the right 
of re-entry. For instance, if A leases his property to B and adds a condition that if B 
sub-lets the leased land, A will have the right to re-enter, i.e., the lease will terminate 
if the lessee breaks the condition by subletting to a third person. Thus, right of re-
entry being a right for the personal benefit of any party cannot exist for the benefit of 
a person who has no personal interest in the land. For example, A grants his land by 
way of lease to B, a limited liability company on condition that the land should revert 
to A from B if the company goes into liquidation. This is a mere right in favour of A 
and this right A cannot transfer to anyone as this is a personal right which can be 
exercised by A only. But if A transfers the whole of his interest in the land including 
the right of re-entry to C, there the right to re-entry is a legal incident of property and 
can be validly transferred along with the property. 
(c)  Transfer of easement 
An easement is a right enjoyed by the owner of land over the land of another: 
such as, right of way, right of light, right of support, right to a flow of air or water. 
Section 4 of the Easements Act defines an easement as a right which the owner or 
occupier of certain land possesses as such for the beneficial enjoyment of the land, 
to do and continue to do something or to prevent and to continue to prevent 
something being done in or upon or in respect of certain other and not his own land. 
An easement includes a right to enjoy a profit out of the land of another. An easement 
exists for the accommodation and better enjoyment of the land to which it is annexed. 
The land owned by the possessor of the land is known as dominant tenement and the 
land over which the right is enjoyed is known as the servient tenement. As an 
easement confers no proprietory right on its owner, it cannot be transferred apart 
from the land itself. For example, the right of certain villagers to bath in another‟s tank 
cannot be transferred. Similarly if A, the owner of a house X, has a right of way over 
an adjoining plot of land belonging to B, he cannot transfer this right of way to C. But 
if he transfers the house itself to C, the easement is also transferred to C. 
It may be noted, however, that the prohibition is only with regard to transfer of an 
existing easement. The law does not prohibit the grant or creation of new easement 
(Bhagwan Sahai v. Narsing. (1909) 31 ALL. 612; Satyanarayana v. Lakshamaya 5 
H.L.J. 56 or the extension of an easement by release in favour of the owner of 
servient tenement). 
(d)  Restricted interest or personal interest 
An interest restricted in enjoyment to the owner personally is by its very nature 
not transferable unless the restriction is void under Section 10. Examples of such 
restricted interest or property are the following: 
 
(i) The right of pre-emption given under the Mohammedan Law. 
 (ii) The office of a Shebait of a Temple or mohunt of a mutt or mutuwalli of a 
wakf. 
 (iii) Emoluments attached to a priestly office. 
 (iv) Service tenures. 
 
EP-GCL-4 
227 
(e)  Right to future maintenance 
This again is a personal right in the property which the law says that it cannot be 
transferred. The right of a Hindu widow to maintenance is a personal right which 
cannot be transferred. Under the law the arrears of past maintenance can be 
transferred, but not the right to future maintenance. 
(f)  Mere right to sue and actionable claim 
A „mere right to sue‟ apart from the interest from which such right accrues cannot 
be assigned. The „right to sue‟ is a personal right annexed to the ownership of 
property and cannot be severed, from it. It is based on the principle of public policy to 
prevent multiplicity of suits; the object is mainly to prevent the abuse resulting from 
trafficking in litigation. 
The use of the word "mere" is significant. The question in every case is whether 
the subject-matter of transfer is property with an incidental remedy for its recovery or 
is a „mere‟ right to „sue‟. Where property is transferred along with a right to recover 
damages or compensation in respect of the property, the assignment is not hit by 
clause (4) of Section 6 of the T.P. Act. 
A mere right to sue cannot be transferred. The right refers to a right to damages 
arising both out of contracts as well as torts. For example, A commits an assault on 
B, B can file a suit to obtain damages; but B cannot assign the right to C and allow 
him to obtain damages. In contract also, the rule is the same. If A breaks a contract 
which he has entered into with B, B can bring action for damages, but B cannot 
transfer this right to C to recover damages. 
There is clear distinction between an actionable claim and a mere right to sue. An 
actionable claim is property and the assignee has a right to sue to enforce the claim. 
As already noted a right to recover an unascertained amount of damages 
resulting from breach of contract or tort is a mere right to sue. If, however, one has a 
right to recover an ascertained and definite debt, he may transfer it because it is an 
actionable claim. Thus, suppose A is indebted to B for Rs. 2,000 and B transfers the 
right to recover the debt of C, the transfer is void. A beneficial interest in specific 
moveable property is also an actionable claim. It has been held that the right to claim 
the benefit of an executory contract constitutes a beneficial interst in moveable 
property (Jaffer Meher Ali v. Budge Budge Jute Mills, (1900) 33 Cal. 702). 
After breach of a contract for the sale of goods nothing is left but a right to sue for 
damages which cannot be transferred. But before breach the benefit of an executing 
contract for the sale of goods may generally be transferred and the buyer has the 
right to sue for the goods. 
(g)  Transfer of public office and salaries, stipends, etc. 
It is against public policy for a public officer to transfer the salary of his office, for 
the salary is given for the purpose of upholding its dignity and the proper performance 
of its duties. Civil and military pensions are not transferable. A pension retains its 
character as long as it is unpaid and is in the hands of Government, but as soon as it 
is paid to the pensioner or his legal representatives, it can be transferred. Since these 
allowances, pensions and stipends are given on personal basis, the law does not 
allow these types of property to be transferred. 
EP-GCL-4 
228 
17.  RULE AGAINST PERPETUITY 
Section 14 of the Act provides that no transfer of property can operate to create 
an interest which is to take effect after the life time of one or more persons living at 
the date of such transfer, and the minority of some person who shall be in existence 
at the expiration for that period, and to whom, if he attains full age, the interest 
created is to belong. 
The rule against perpetuity is based on the general principle that the liberty of 
alienation shall not be exercised to its own destruction and that all contrivances shall 
be void which tend to create a perpetuity or place property forever out of the reach of 
the exercise of the power of alienation. Perpetuity has been described as 
“exemptions from intermission or ceasing”. This has been said to be “odious in law, 
destructive to the commonwealth, and an impediment to commence, but preventing 
the wholesome circulation of property”. 
A perpetuity in the primary sense of the word, “is a disposition which makes 
property inalienable for an indefinite period” (Jarman on Wills, 8th ed., vol. 1, P. 284). 
Section 14 of the Act adopted with certain modifications the English rule against 
perpetuities which is enunciated by Jarman as “Subject to the exceptions to be 
presently mentioned, no Contingent or executory interest in property can be validity 
created, unless it must necessarily vest within the maximum period of one or more 
lives in being and twenty-one years afterwards”. Section 14 of the Act fixes the 
perpetuity period as: Life (or Lives) living at the time of transfer and actual minority of 
the then unborn ultimate transferee. 
Any number of successive estates can be created between the transferees who 
are living persons e.g. A transfer may be made to A for life and then to B for life and 
then to C for life and so on, provided that A, B and C are all living persons at the date 
of the transfer. But if the ultimate beneficiary is some one who is not in existence at 
the date of the transfer, the whole residue of the estate should be transferred to him. 
If he is born before the termination of the last prior estate, he takes a vested interest 
at birth and takes possession on the termination of the last prior estate but if he is not 
born till the termination of the last prior estate, the transfer to him fails. 
Further, the rule is not that vested interest is created at the birth of the beneficiary 
but that vested interest cannot be delayed in any case beyond his minority. 
Therefore, the rule against perpetuity is that the minority of the ultimate beneficiary is 
the latest period at which an estate can be made to vest. 
In India minority terminates at the end of 18 years. 
The rule against perpetuities applies to both moveable and immoveable property. 
Thus, the rule against perpetuity contains two propositions, i.e.: 
 (1) No transfer is valid after the life-time of one or more persons living at the 
date of such transfer. Transfer can remain in effect only during the life time 
of an existing person. 
 (2) Transfer can be extended to a person who is not in existence but if he is in 
existence at the time of termination of the period of last transfer. The 
moment the person is born he shall have contingent interest and after 
minority i.e. after the age of 18 years, he shall have vested interest. Barring 
these two conditions, a restriction on alienation of a property is void. 
 
EP-GCL-4 
229 
 
 The rule against perpetuities is also called the rule against remoteness 
because it is directed against limitations which are too remote and are 
expressed to take effect beyond the maximum period permitted by law. 
However, Section 18 provides an exception to the above rule of perpetuity, where 
the transfer of property is for the benefit of the public in the advancement of religion, 
knowledge, commerce, health, safety, or any other object beneficial to mankind. 
Effect of a transfer on failure of prior interest 
Further, where by reason of any rules or the rules contained in Sections 13 and 
14, interest created for the benefit of a person or class of persons fails in regard to 
such person or the whole of such class, any interest created in the same transaction 
and intended to take effect or upon failure of such prior intersts also fail (Section 16). 
For example, property is transferred to A for life then to his unborn son B for life and 
then to C, who is living at the date of transfer, absolutely. Here B is given only a life 
interest. So the transfer to B is invalid under Section 13. The subsequent transfer to 
C absolutely is also invalid, because according to Section 16, if a prior transfer fails, 
the subsequent transfer will also fail. 
No transfer of property can operate to create an interest which is to take effect 
after the life time of one or more persons living at date on such transfer, and the 
minority of some person who shall be in existence on the expiration of that period, to 
whom, if he attains full age, the interest created is to belong. 
The policy of the law has been to prevent property being tied up for ever. The 
vesting cannot be postponed beyond the life time of any person living at the date of 
transfer. For example, if an estate is given to a living person A for life and then to the 
unborn son of A, the son of A must be in existence on or before the date of the expiry 
of the life estate in favour of A. The vesting of absolute interest in favour of an unborn 
person may be postponed until he attains majority. For example, an estate may be 
transferred to A, living person, and after his death to his unborn son when he attains 
the age of 18. Such transfer would not be violative of the rule against perpetuity. 
18.  ACCUMULATION OF INCOME 
Section 17 does not allow accumulation of income from the land for an unlimited 
period without the income-being enjoyed by owner of the property. The law allows 
accumulation of income for a certain period only. The period for which such 
accumulation is valid is : 
 (a) the life of the transferor, or 
 (b) eighteen years from the date of transfer. 
Any direction to accumulate the income beyond the period mentioned above is 
void except where it is for: 
 
(i) the payment of the debts of the transferor or any other person taking any 
interest under the transferor, 
 (ii) portions for children or any other person taking any interest in the property 
under the transfer, and 
 (iii) for the preservation and maintenance of the property transferred.

19.  DOCTRINE OF LIS PENDENS 
Lis means dispute, Lis pendens means a pending suit, action, petition or the like. 
Section 52 of the T.P. Act incorporates the doctrine of Lis pendens. It states that 
during the pendency of a suit in a Court of Law, property which is subject to a 
litigation cannot be transferred. When we say that property cannot be transferred 
what we mean in this context is that property may be transferred but this transfer is 
subject to the rights that are created by a Court‟s decree. For example, A and B are 
litigating in a Court of law over property X and during the pendency of the suit A 
transfers the property X to C. The suit ends in B‟s favour. Here C who obtained the 
property during the time of litigation cannot claim the property. He is bound by the 
decree of the Court wherein B has been given the property. 
Section 52 lays down the Indian rule of Lis pendens being the legislative 
expression of the Maxim- “ut lite pendente nihil innovetur” „During litigation nothing 
new should be introduced‟. 
Essentials 
In order to constitute a Lis pendens, the following elements must be present: 
 
1. There must be a suit or proceeding in a Court of competent jurisdiction. 
 
2. The suit or proceeding must not be collusive. 
 
3. The litigation must be one in which right to immoveable property is directly 
and specifically in question. 
 
4. There must be transfer of or otherwise dealing with the property in dispute 
by any party to the litigation. 
 
5. Such transfer must effect the rights of the other party that may ultimately 
accrue under the terms of the decree or order. 
The rule is based on the doctrine of expediency i.e., the necessity for final 
adjudication. A plea of lis pendens will be allowed to be raised even though the point 
is not taken in the pleadings or raised as an issue. 
When an application to sue in forma pauperies is admitted, the suit is pending 
from the time of presentation of the application to the Court but not if it is rejected. 
A suit in foreign Court cannot operate as lis pendens. The doctrine of lis pendens 
does not apply to moveables. It is the essence of the rule that a right to immoveable 
property is directly and specifically in question in the suit. The doctrine is not 
applicable in favour of a third-party. 
 
EP-GCL-4 
231 
Effect 
If the parties to the litigation, are completely prevented from transferring the 
property in litigation, it would cause unnecessary delay and hardship, as they would 
have to wait till the final disposal of the case. So, Section 53 creates a limitation over 
the transfer by making it subject to the result of the litigation. The effect of this 
doctrine is not to invalidate or avoid the transfer, or to prevent the vesting of title in 
the transfer, but to make it subject to the decision of the case, and the rule would 
operate even if the transferee pendente lite had no notice of the pending suit or 
proceeding at the time of the transfer. 
20.  PROVISIONS RELATING TO SPECIFIC TRANSFERS 
The Act expressly provides for special types of transfers such as sale, exchange, 
gift, mortgage and lease. 
These are as follows: 
In a sale, exchange and gift, there is a transfer of the ownership of property but 
mortgage is a transfer of an interest in specific immoveable property and lease is a 
transfer of the right to enjoy immoveable property. 
1.  Sale 
Under Section 54 of the T.P. Act, "sale" has been defined as a 
transfer of ownership in exchange for a price paid or promised or part 
paid and part-promised. 
Essentials 
 (a) The seller must be a person competent to transfer. The buyer must be any 
person who is not disqualified to be the transferee under Section 6(h)(3). 
 (b) The subject matter is transferable property. 
 (c) There is a transfer of ownership. This feature distinguishes a sale from 
mortgage, lease etc., where there is no such transfer of ownership. 
 (d) It must be an exchange for a price paid or promised or part paid and part 
promised. 
 (e) There must be present a money consideration. If the consideration is not 
money but some other valuable consideration it may be an exchange or 
barter but not a sale. 
Mode of transfer by sale 
Sale of an immoveable property can be effected, 
 (a) Where such property is tangible (i) by a registered instrument if it is of the 
value of Rs. 100 and upwards, and (ii) by a registered instrument or by 
delivery of property when it is less than Rs. 100 in value, and 
 (b) Where the property is tangible or a reversion, only by a registered 
instrument. 
EP-GCL-4 
232 
Contract for sale 
A contract for the sale of immoveable property differs from a contract for the sale 
of goods in that the Court will grant specific performance of it unless special reasons 
to the contrary are shown. 
The rights and liabilities of a seller and buyer are dealt with in Section 55 of the 
Transfer of Property Act. 
2.  Exchange 
Sections 118 to 121 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deal with "Exchanges". 
When two persons mutually transfer the ownership of one thing for the 
ownership of another, neither thing or both things being money only, 
the transaction is called an "exchange". 
Essentials 
 
(i) The person making the exchange must be competent to contract. 
 (ii) There must be mutual consent. 
 (iii) There is a mutual transfer of ownership though things and interests may not 
be identical. 
 (iv) Neither party must have paid money only. 
This Section applies to both moveable and immoveable property. 
Mode of exchange 
A transfer of property in completion of an exchange can be made only in the 
matter provided for the transfer of such property by sale. 
3.  Gift 
The provisions relating to "Gifts" have been stipulated under Sections 122 to 128 
of the Act. 
Section 122 of the Transfer of Property Act defines "gift" as follows: 
 
 “Gift" is the transfer of certain existing moveable or immoveable property 
made voluntarily and without consideration by one person called the donor, 
to another called the donee and accepted by or on behalf of the donee. 
 
 Such acceptance must be made during the life time of the donor and while 
he is still capable of giving. If the donee dies before acceptance, the gift is 
void. 
Essentials 
 
1. There must be a transfer of ownership. 
 
2. The subject matter of gift must be a certain existing 
moveable or immoveable property. 
 
EP-GCL-4 
233 
 
3. The transfer must be made voluntarily. 
 
4. It must be done without consideration. 
 
5. There must be acceptance by or on behalf of the donee, and such 
acceptance must be made during the lifetime of the donor and while he is 
capable of giving. 
There are two parties to the gift: donor and donee. The donor must be a person 
competent to transfer; whereas the donee may be any person. The gift can be made 
to any one, to an incompetent person or even to a juridicial person. The essence of a 
gift is that it is a gratuitous transfer. 
Formalities 
According to Section 123, a gift of immoveable property must be made by a 
registered instrument signed by or on behalf of the donor and attested by at least two 
witnesses. A gift of moveable property may be made by a registred instrument or by 
delivery of property. Where the donee is already in possession of the moveable 
property, as no future delivery is possible, the donor may make a declaration of the 
gift in his favour. For example, where a piece of furniture or a television set belonging 
to the donor is lying with a friend of his, the donor may simply declare that he makes 
a gift of the furniture or the television set and the gift is complete. The declaration 
must be clear and the donee must accept the gift. 
A gift of immoveable property, as said above, must be effected by registration. 
Where a gift in favour of someone is registered but it is not accepted by the donee, 
the gift is incomplete. Suppose, a document is executed by the donor who makes a 
gift of immoveable property and the deeds are delivered to donee, and the donee 
accepts the gifts but the document is not registered. Will the gift by valid? It has been 
held by the Courts that the gift is valid. While registration is a necessary formality for 
the enforcement of a gift of immoveable property, it does not suspend the gift until 
registration actually takes place. The donee in such a case can ask the donor to 
complete the gift by registration. Thus, the most essential thing for the validity of a gift 
is its acceptance. If the gift is accepted but not registred it is a valid gift. The Privy 
Council in Kalyan Sundram v. Kumarappa, A.I.R. 1925 P.C. 42, decided that 
after acceptance of the deed of gift and before registration, the donor cannot 
revoke the gift. The gift which is accepted by the donee, will take effect from 
the date of the execution of the document by the donor, even though it is 
registered at a later date. 
If the deed of gift is executed but never communicated to the intended donee and 
remains in the possession of the donor undelivered, it cannot be compulsory 
registered at the instance of the donee. The reason is that the donee did not accept 
the gift, the donor can at any time before such acceptance revoke the gift. But once a 
gift is accepted by the donee, the donor cannot revoke it. A gift may, however, be 
revoked if it is brought about by a fraud or misrepresentation or undue influence. 
The other essential characteristic of a gift is that it cannot be revoked at the will 
and pleasure of the grantor. A revocable gift is one which may be revoked by the 
donor at any time. Its revocation would depend upon the mere will or pleasure of the 
donor. Such a gift is void. But on the other hand, if the condition is one which does 
not depend on the will or pleasure of the donor, the gift can be revoked on the 
happening of such condition.

to Rs. 90,000 but is void as to Rs. 10,000 which continues to belong to A. 
A gift which comes into existence on the fulfilment of a condition, that is to say, a 
gift which is subject to a condition precedent is also valid. A condition precedent, as 
already explained in this study dealing with vested interest and contingent interest, is 
one which must be fulfilled before the transfer takes effect. But the condition attached 
to the gift should not be illegal or immoral. For instance, a gift to A on condition that 
he murders B is not valid. 
A gift comprising both of existing property and future property is void as to the 
latter. For example, A makes a gift of his house and also makes a gift of the additions 
that he is likely to make in future. Here the gift of the house is valid but the gift of the 
additions that are yet to be made is invalid. 
Onerous gift:  Lastly reference may also be made to what is known as an 
onerous gift. It may be that several things are transferred as a gift by single 
transaction. Whereas some of them are really beneficial the others convey 
burdensome obligations. The result is that the benefit which it confers is more than 
counter balanced by the burden it places. For instance, A makes a gift of shares in 
the companies X and Y. X is prosperous but heavy calls are expected in respect of 
shares in Y company. The gift is onerous.The rule as laid down in Section 127 is that 
the donee takes nothing by the gift unless he accepts it fully. Where the gift is in the 
form of two or more independent transfers to the same person of several things, the 
donee is at liberty to accept one of them and refuse the other. 
The rules pertaining to gifts in the Transfer of Property Act do not apply to the 
gifts by Mohammedans. If a gift is made by a Mohammedan, its validity has to be 
judged according to Muslim law and not according to the Transfer of Property Act.

4.  Leases 
(i)  Meaning and nature of lease:  According to Section 105, a "lease" of 
immoveable property is a transfer of a right to enjoy property. Since it is a transfer to 
enjoy and use the property, possession is always given to the transferee. The lease 
of immoveable property must be made for a certain period. For example, you may 
give a lease of property for a definite number of years, or for life, or even 
permanently. 
Essentials 
The essentials of a lease are: 
 
(1) It is a transfer of a right to enjoy immoveable property; 
 (2) Such transfer is for a certain time or perpetuity; 
 (3) It is made for consideration which is either premium or rent or both; 
 (4) The transfer must be accepted by the transferee. 
The transferor is called the lessor, the transferee is called the lessee, the price is 
called premium and the money, share, service or any other thing of value to be so 
rendered is called the rent. 
The parties to the lease (i.e. lessor and lessee), must be competent to make and 
to take the lease respectively. 
(ii)  Lease and licence:  A lease should be distinguished from a licence. A licence 
is a right to do or continue to do in or upon the immoveable property of the grantor, 
something which would, in the absence of such a right, be unlawful. 
A licence does not transfer any interest in the property and the licencee has no 
right to possession. A licence can be revoked by the grantor at any time, whereas a 
lease cannot be revoked. If, I sell the fruits of my garden to you, you are given 
permission or licence to enter my garden and take away the fruits. A lease involves a 
transfer of interest followed by possession of the property for a specified period. The 
real test is the intention of the parties.  
If the document creates an interest in the property, it is a lease but if it only 
permits another to make use of the property of which the legal possession 
continues with the owner, it is a licence because it does not create any interest 
in that property (Associated Hotel of India v. R.N. Kapoor, A.I.R. (1956) S.C. 
1962).  
The question is not of words but of substance and the label which the parties 
choose to put upon the transaction though relevant is not decisive. 
(iii)  Formalities:  According to Section 107, a lease from year to year or for any 
term exceeding one year can be made only by a registered document. If a lease is  
for a term below one year, it can be made by an oral agreement. If a lease is created 
by oral agreement, it must be accompanied by delivery of possession. If the lease is 
for a year or more, it must be effected by a registered document. If after the 
registration, the lessor does not give possession, the lessee can sue for possession. 
EP-GCL-4 
236 
(iv)  Types of tenancies:  Following are the various types of tenancies: 
 (a) Tenancy from year to year:  A tenancy from year to year may be made by a 
grant of land from year to year. If the tenancy is for a year to start with but 
after the expiration of one year the lessee continues to be in possession 
and pays the rent to the landlord, the tenancy is regarded as a year-to-year 
tenancy. If, in case of a tenancy for a period more than a year the landlord 
wants to terminate or end the lease, he has to give a six-month‟s notice to 
the lessee to quit. In case of a tenancy from month to month, a fifteen days 
notice to quit is necessary. The monthly tenancy may be created either by 
contract or may be presumed from the nature of the tenancy to be one, 
from month to month. 
Illustration 
A lets a house to B for 5 years, B sublets the house to C at a monthly rent of Rs. 
100. The five years expire, but C continues in possession of the house and pays the 
rent to A. C‟s lease is renewed from month to month. 
 (b) Tenancy-at-will:  Tenancy-at-will is a tenancy recognised by law. This comes 
into existence where a tenant holds over with the consent is let into 
occupation. We have stated above that if the tenant continues to be in 
possession after the expiration of tenancy and pays the rent to the landlord, 
the tenancy may be one from year to year or from month to month. During a 
period when the tenant is in possession after expiry of the period, if the 
tenant stays with the consent of the landlord till such time as further period is 
fixed or a fresh contract is made, the tenant is called a tenant-at-will. The 
landlord will decide for what further period shall the tenancy be given. „A 
tenancy-at-will is implied when a person is in possession by the consent of 
the owner and is not held in view of any tenancy for a certain time. The 
tenancy-at-will does not mean that the landlord has to give a proper notice to 
quit. The tenant-at-will cannot sublet during that period because no valid 
contract for further extension in his favour has been made. The death of the 
landlord or tenant determines the tenancy, i.e., the tenancy comes to an end. 
 (c) A tenancy by sufferance:  This is a tenancy which is created by fiction of 
law. If a tenant continues to be in possession after the determination of the 
period of the lease without the consent of the landlord, he becomes a 
tenant by sufferance. A tenant-at-will is in possession with the consent of 
the landlord, whereas a tenant by sufferance is in possession without his 
permission after the term of the lease comes to an end. This type of tenant 
is not regarded as a trespasser because the tenant had in his favour a valid 
lease to start with. No notice is necessary to such a tenant for eviction. This 
tenant is not responsible for rent. He is liable to pay compensation for use 
and occupation of the land. 
(v)  Requirements of a valid notice:  In order that a notice to quit is valid it must 
be a proper notice. The notice must convey the intention to terminate the tenancy as 
a whole and must specify the date on which the tenancy would expire. As mentioned 
earlier, if the lease is a lease from month to month, 15 days, notice is required. If it is 
from year to year 6 months‟ notice is required. A lease of the moveable property for 
agricultural or manufacturing purposes shall be deemed to be a lease from year to 
year. The notice should expire with the end of the period of the tenancy. If it is a lease 
 
EP-GCL-4 
237 
from month to month and the notice is given by the landlord, the tenant should be 
asked to quit at the end of the month of the tenancy. The landlord cannot ask his 
tenant to quit at any time before the expiry of a month or a year of the tenancy. 
Illustration 
A grants lease for 4 years commencing form 1-6-1961. (This day should be 
excluded for counting the duration of lease). The lease will end at the midnight of        
1-6-1965, i.e., the lease commenced from 2-6-1961, therefore, a notice to quit given 
on 1-2-1968 for leaving the premises on 1-3-1968 is a notice expiring with the end of 
month of tenancy and it is a valid notice. 
Note that in the above illustration, the lease after 4 years is continued on a 
monthly tenancy basis till the landlord gives notice in the year 1968. 
(vi)  Determination of leases:  Section 111 of the Transfer of Property Act spells 
out the various contingencies in which a lease comes to an end. A lease is 
determined, i.e., comes to an end in the following ways: 
 (1) By efflux of time or lapse of time:  A lease for a definite period, such as a 
lease for a year, or for a term of years, expires on the last day of the term 
and the lessor or any person entitled to get back the property may enter 
without notice or any other formality. Since a lease is a transfer of interest 
in the property, if during the period for which a lease is valid, the lessee 
dies, the heirs of the lessee can continue the lease till the expiry of the 
period. 
 (2) By the happening of a special event:  When a lease is granted subject to 
the happening of an event, it comes to an end when the event takes place. 
Thus, if B grants lease to A for life, it comes to an end on the death of A. 
Similarly, if a lease is granted for the duration of the war, it comes to an end 
when the war ends. Where the interest of the lessor is limited, the lease 
comes, to an end when he loses the interest or where he does not have 
any power to grant a lease. For example, a tenant for life can grant a lease 
only to last during his life time. It comes to an end on his death. 
 (3) Merger:  A lease comes to an end when the lessee buys the property of the 
lessor or when the lessee takes the lessor‟s interest by succession. Here 
the right of the lessee merges in that of the lessor. Naturally, the lessee 
becomes the owner of the property after he acquires it. So there will be no 
more a lease. 
 (4) By surrender:  A lease may come to an end by surrender. Surrender may 
be either express or implied. Express surrender arises when the lessee 
yields up his interst under a lease by mutual consent. Implied surrender 
occurs, as follows :- if during the subsistence of the lease, a new lease is 
granted to the tenant to commence at once in substitution for the existing 
lease, it operates as a surrender of the old lease. For example, a lessee, 
accepts to take effect during the continuance of the existing lease. This is 
an implied surrender of the former lease and such lease comes to an end. 
Similarly, when the landlord reserves possession without any objection on 
the tenant‟s part, there is a surrender by implication. Mere non-payment of 
rent does not amount to surrender. 
EP-GCL-4 
238 
? 
 (5) By forfeiture:  A lease also comes to an end by forfeiture. A forfeiture 
occurs when there is breach of a condition in a lease contract by the 
lessee. Under the Transfer of Property Act, forfeiture occurs in the following 
circumstances—the first case in which forfeiture occurs is the case when 
the lessee breaks an express condition which may be of various types such 
as, if the lessee does not pay the rent regularly, or if the lessee becomes 
insolvent, or where the lessee sublets the property to another person. In all 
such cases there will be a forfeiture. But the condition that the lessee 
breaks must be an express condition which must have been incorporated in 
the contract of lease. Then only the lessor can re-enter the leased property 
and claim that the lease shall be forfeited. 
In the case of a forfeiture due to default in payment of the rent, if the lessor sues 
the lessee to quit, the Court can direct the lessee to pay the rent or arrears of rent 
and continue the lease. But in a breach of any other condition, such as the breach of 
a condition preventing the lessee from subletting the property, the Court will not help 
the lessee if he breaks the condition. He will incur forfeiture. A breach of condition by 
the lessee gives an option to the lessor to bring the lease to an end. But if he does 
not exercise the option the lease will continue validly. The lessee, however, cannot 
on breaking the condition, take advantage of his wrong and terminate the lease. 
The second case of forfeiture occurs when the tenant denies the title of the 
landlord and claims that somebody else or he himself is the owner of the property. In 
order that a denial of the landlord‟s title should work as a forfeiture of the lease, three 
things are necessary: 
 (a) the tenant must set up title either in himself or in a third-party; 
 (b) the denial must be direct and not casual; 
 (c) it must be made known to the landlord. 
Illustration 
A is a tenant of B, but C claims to be the landlord. B sues A for rent and A in his 
written statement states. “I have never paid rent to B. C now claims rent. I am ready 
to pay whosoever is the rightful owner. There is no forfeiture and B cannot evict A in 
a subsequent suit. 
The third case where forfeiture occurs is where the lessee is adjudged an 
insolvent and the lease provides that the lessor may re-enter on the happening of 
such event. It may, however, be noted, that the effect of these provisions has been 
considerably diluted by various Rent Control and Eviction Acts passed by various 
legislatures.

Duties of the Lessor and Rights of the Lessee 
(vii)  Duties of the Lessor:  Following are some of the duties of the lessor: 
 (a) The lessor is bound to disclose to the lessee any material defect in the 
property with reference to its intended use of which the lessor is and the 
lessee is not aware. This rule applies only to physical defects of the 
property such as the condition and the nature of the property leased. You 
will note that the lessor is not bound to disclose whether or not he has title 
to the property. 
 (b) The next duty of the lessor is to put the lessee in possession of the 
property. A lease is a transfer of possession the consideration being rent 
and, therefore, it follows that the landlord cannot recover the rent unless he 
has delivered possession to the tenant. If a contract of lease has been 
executed and the lessor does not give possession of the property to the 
lessee, the lessee can sue the lessor for possession. 
 (c) The next duty that is cast on the lessor is what is usually called convenant 
for quiet enjoyment. The covenant, that is the right to undisturbed 
possession, so long as the lessee pays the rent, presupposes possession 
and, therefore, no action can be brought on this convenant unless the 
lessee has first obtained possession. The covenant for possession gives 
the lessee the right to obtain possession; the covenant for quiet enjoyment 
gives the lessee a right to continue in such possession. If the lessee‟s 
possession is disturbed, he can sue for damages or, in case a part of the 
leased property is taken possession of either by the lessor or by any third-
party; the lessee can hold a part of the leased property and pay a 
proportionate rent. 
(viii)  Duties of the lessee:  The lessee has the following duties: 
 (a) The lessee is bound to disclose to the lessor any fact as to nature or extent 
of the interest that the lessee is about to take, of which the lessee is, and 
the lessor is not aware and which materially increases the value of such 
interest. 
 (b) The lessee is bound to pay or tender at the proper time and place, the 
premium or rent to the lessor or his agent in this behalf. We have already 
seen that in case the lessee does not pay the rent, he may incur forfeiture 
of the tenancy. The liability to pay the rent commences from the date the 
tenant is put into possession. 
 (c) The next duty of the lessee is that he uses the property as a person of 
ordinary prudence would make use of. But he shall not permit another person 
to use the property for purposes other than that for which it was leased. 
 (d) He should not do any act which is destructive of or permanently injurious to 
the property. 
 (e)  The lessee must not, without the lessor‟s consent, erect on the property 
any permanent structure except for agricultural purpose. If he wants to 
erect certain fixtures or chattel on the leased property, it must be done 
without causing any damage to the property. Before the termination of the 
lease, he can remove all the things attached to the earth. If permanent 
fixtures are to be made, the lessee must obtain the consent of the landlord. 
EP-GCL-4 
240 
? 
 
(f) If the lessee comes to know of any proceedings by way of suit to recover 
the property of the lessor, the lessee should immediately inform the lessor. 
Since, the tenant is in possession of the property he is the person who is 
not likely to know of any encroachment on the landlord‟s property and he 
should therefore inform the landlord. 
 (g) The lessee should hand over the property at the end of the lease. 
(ix)  Rights of the lessee:  The lessee enjoys the following rights: 
 (a) If during the continuance of the lease any accession is made to the 
property, such accession is deemed to be comprised in the lease, the 
lessee has a right to enjoy the accretions of the leased property. 
 (b) Where, under the contract, the landlord has agreed to repair the property, 
the lessee can carry out the repairs and deduct the expenses from the rent 
if the landlord fails to do so. 
 (c) If the lessee has made payment which the lessor is bound by law to pay 
such as payment of Government revenues or municipal taxes on the 
property, the lessee can deduct the amount from the rent and pay the 
balance to the lessor. He can even take interest on the amount he has 
paid. 
 (d) The lessee has a right to remove the fixtures he has erected-during the 
term of the lease. 
 (e) If, due to no fault of his, the lease comes to an end (i.e., when the lease is 
of uncertain duration), the lessee or his legal representatives are entitled to 
all the crops planted or grown by the lessee. The lessee or his 
representatives have got a right to come and carry away the crops, etc., 
which are growing on the land. If the lease is of a definite period, such a 
right cannot be claimed, particularly, when lessee has committed a fault, 
e.g., where he has committed a breach of a condition entailing forfeiture. 
 
(f) The lessee may avoid the lease, if property is wholly or partly destroyed by 
tempest, flood, or fire so as to make it impossible to continue the lease for 
the purpose for which it was let. 
 (g) The lessee has right to transfer absolutely or by way of mortgage or sub-
lease, the whole or any part of his interest in the property. We have also 
noticed that the lessee‟s rights are transferable.

5.  Actionable Claims 
"Actionable claim" has been dealt with under Sections 130 to 137 of the Act. 
 
(i) Definition: "Actionable claim" is defined in Section 3 of the Transfer of 
Property Act as follows: 
 
 A claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immoveable 
property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any 
beneficial interest in moveable property not in the possession, either actual 
or constructive, of the claimant, which the Civil courts recognize as 
affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be 
existent, accruing, conditional or contingent. 
Actionable claims are claims, to unsecured debts. If a debt is secured by the 
mortgage of immoveable property it is not an actionable claim, because the Section 
clearly excludes such a debt. A debt is a liquidated money obligation which is usually 
recoverable by a suit. To create a debt, first of all, there must be a liquidated or 
definite sum which is actually due. For example, arrears of rent due. The term debt 
may also include a sum of money which is due in the sense that it exists, but is not 
actually payable until a later date. For example, A borrows money from B on the 1st 
of January and promises to rapay on March 15, the amount is not payable till the 15th 
of March, but certainly it is a debt and it is an accruing debt. Another essential of an 
actionable claim is that it is not in possession of a person and the person can claim 
such a debt by bringing an action in a Court of law. 
The Section also says that it must be a claim to any debt which the Civil Courts 
recognise as affording grounds for relief to the person who claims it. 
Illustrations of actionable claims: 
 
(i) Arrears of rent accrual constitute a „debt‟ so it is an actionable claim (Sheu 
Gobind Singh v. Gauri Prasad, AIR 1925 Pat. 310). 
 (ii) Provident Fund that is standing to the credit of a member of the Provident 
Fund. 
 (iii) Money due under the Insurance Policy. 
 (iv) A partner‟s right to sue for accounts of dissolved partnership is an 
actionable claim being a beneficial interest in moveable property not in 
possession (Thakardas v. Vishindas). 
Non-actionable claims 
 
(i) Debentures are secured debts and therefore not regarded as actionable 
claims. 
 (ii) Copy right though a beneficial interest in immoveable property is not 
an actionable claim since the owner has actual or constructive 
possession of the same (Savitri Devi v. Dwarka Bhatya, (1939) All 305). 
Again, an actionable claim includes a beneficial interest in the moveable property 
not in possession. Now, a benefit of a contract for the purchase of goods is a 
beneficial interest in moveable property. 
EP-GCL-4 
242 
Illustration 
A agrees on 1.2.1985 to deliver 1,000 gunny bags to B on 1.3.1985. On 1.2.1985 
B assigns interest in the contract to C. A fails to deliver the bags on 1.3.1985. C can 
sue A because a beneficial interest in a subsisting contract which relates to moveable 
property is an actionable claim which can be validly transferred. 
Suppose in the above Illustration B has assigned the right to C to claim damages 
after the contract was broken. That is B transfers his right to sue A on, say, 1.4.1985, 
(i.e., one month after the contract was broken). In this case what B has assigned to C 
is a mere right to sue A and get damages. B cannot transfer this right. You will recall 
that a mere right to sue cannot be transferred. After the breach of the contract, B has 
a mere right to sue A which he cannot assign or transfer. To repeat an actionable 
claim is a claim to any debt other than a debt secured by a mortgage and it includes a 
beneficial interest in the moveable property. 
(ii)  How actionable claims are transferred:  Actionable claims can be transferred 
by the execution of an instrument in writing signed by the transferor or his duly 
authorised agent. 
Not much formality is required for the transfer of an actionable claim. It can 
validly be transferred, in writing and signed by the transferor or his agent. After a valid 
transfer, the transferee of an actionable claim must give notice to the debtor to 
complete his title. Thereafter he can sue or institute proceedings for the same in his 
own name without obtaining the transferor‟s consent to such suit or proceedings. 
Illustration 
A owes money to B, who transfers it to C. B then demands the debt from A who 
not having received notice of transfer, pays to B. The payment is valid and C cannot 
sue A for the debt. 
Some problems and their Answers: 
 (a) A owed money to B. B transferred the debt by deed of gift to C. 
Subsequently, he transferred it for value to D. Who is entitled to the 
amount? 
 
 Answer:  The first transfer is in favour of C. The transfer of an actionable 
claim may be even without consideration. So the assignment in favour of C 
is valid. The subsequent transfer to D for consideration cannot deprive C of 
the rights which he has already acquired. C is, therefore, entitled to the 
money. 
 (b) A effects a policy on his own life with the Life Insurance Corporation and 
deposits it with a bank for securing payment of an existing debt. A dies and 
the bank claims the amount from the L.I.C., against A‟s heirs. Is the transfer 
to the Bank valid? 
 
 Answer:  The amount due under a policy of insurance is an actionable 
claim. The assignment of an actionable claim should be made in writing and 
by the transferor. The deposit of the policy by the transferor as security 
without written document in favour of the bank is not a valid assignement. 
The bank cannot have any claim as against the heirs of A.

6.  Mortgages  
Sections 58 to 104 of the Act deal with "Mortgages". 
(i)  Definition and nature of mortgage:  According to Section 58 of the Transfer of 
Property Act, a "mortgage" is the transfer of an interest in specific immoveable 
property for the purpose of securing the payment of money advanced or to be 
advanced by way of loan, an existing or future debt or the performance of an 
engagement which may give rise to pecuniary liability. 
The transferor is called a mortgagor, the transferee a mortgagee. The principal 
money and interest the payment of which is secured for the time being are called the 
mortgage money and the instrument by which the transfer is effected is called a 
mortgage deed. 
(ii)  Essentials of a mortgage: 
 
(1) Transfer of interest:  The first thing to note is that a 
mortgage is a transfer of interest in the specific immoveable 
property. The mortgagor as an owner of the property is possessed of all the 
interests in it, and when he mortgages the property to secure a loan, he 
only parts with an interest in that property in favour of the mortgagor. After 
mortgage, the interest of the mortgagor is reduced by the interest which 
has been transferred to the mortgagee. His ownership has become less for 
the time being by the interest which he has parted with in favour of the 
mortgagee. If the mortgagor transfers this property, the transferee gets it 
subject to the right of the mortgagor to recover from it what is due to him, 
i.e., the principal plus interest. 
 (2) Specific immoveable property:  The second point is that the property must 
be specifically mentioned in the mortgage deed. Where, for instance, the 
mortgagor stated “all of my property” in the mortgage deed, it was held by 
the Court that this was not a mortgage. The reason why the immoveable 
property must be distinctly and specifically mentioned in the mortgage deed 
is that, in case the mortgagor fails to repay the loan the Court is in a 
position to grant a decree for the sale of any particular property in a suit by 
the mortgagee. 
 (3) To secure the payment of a loan:  Another characteristic of a mortgage is 
that the transaction is for the purpose of securing the payment of a loan for 
the performance of an obligation which may give rise to pecuniary liability. It 
may be for the purpose of obtaining a loan, or if a loan has already been 
granted to secure the repayment of such loan. There is thus a debt and the 
relationship between the mortgagor and the mortgagee is that of debtor and 
creditor. When A borrows 100 bags of paddy and further quantity by way of 
interest, it is mortgage transaction for the performance of an obligation. 
Where, however, a person borrows money and agrees with the creditor that till 
the debt is repaid he will not alienate his property, the transaction does not amount to 
a mortgage. Here the person merely says that he will not transfer his property till he 
has repaid the debt; he does not transfer any interest in the property to the creditor. 
In sale as distinguished from a mortgage, all the interest or rights of ownership are 
transferred to the purchaser. In a mortgage, as stated earlier, only part of the 
EP-GCL-4 
244 
interests are transferred to the mortgagee, some of them remaining vested in the 
mortgagor. 
To sum up, it may be stated that there are three outstanding 
characteristics of a mortgage: 
 
(a) the mortgagee‟s interest in the property mortgaged 
terminates upon the performance of the obligation secured by the 
Mortgage. 
 (b) the mortgagor has a right of foreclosure upon the mortgagor‟s failure to 
perform. 
 (c) the mortgagor has a right to redeem or regain the property on repayment of 
the debt or performance of the obligation. 
(iii)  Form of a mortgage contract:  According to Section 59, where the principal 
money secured is Rs. 100 or upwards, a mortgage, other than a mortgage by deposit 
of title-deeds, can be effected only by a registered instrument or by delivery of 
property. It should be noted that a mortgage is not a mere contract but it is the 
Conveyance of Interest in the mortgaged property and as soon as the mortgage deed 
is registered an interest in the property vests in the mortgagee. 
(iv)  Kinds of mortgages:  There are in all six kinds of mortgages in immoveable 
property, namely 
 (a) Simple mortgage. 
 (b) Mortgage by conditional sale. 
 (c) Usufractuary mortgage. 
 (d) English mortgage. 
 (e) Mortgage by deposit of title-deeds or equitable mortgage. 
 
(f) Anomalous mortgage. 
(a)  Simple mortgage 
In a simple mortgage, the mortgagor binds himself personally to pay the debt and 
agrees in the event of his failure to pay the mortgage money, the mortgagee shall 
have the right to cause the property to be applied so far as may be necessary by 
means of a decree for the sale of property. If the mortgaged property is not sufficient 
to discharge the debt, the mortgagee can bring a personal action against the 
mortgagor and obtain a decree which, like any other money decree, can be executed 
against other properties of the mortgagor. In simple mortgage, no right of possession 
or foreclosure is available to the mortgagee. 
(b)  Mortgage by conditional sale 
In this type of mortgage, the property is mortgaged with a condition super added 
that in the event of a failure by the debtor to repay the debt at the stipulated time, the 
transaction should be regarded a sale, and in case the loan is repaid at the stipulated 
time, the sale shall be invalid, or on condition that on such payment being made the 
buyer shall transfer the property to the seller. 
Thus, for all practical purposes, this type of mortgage is ostensible sale of the 
mortgaged property with a condition for re-purchase by the mortgagor by repaying 
 
EP-GCL-4 
245 
the loan. It will be noted that the mortgagor transfers the property with the following 
three conditions: 
 (a) If the loan is repaid, the sale becomes void. 
 (b) If the loan is not repaid at the stipulated time, the sale will become absolute 
and binding. 
 (c) When the debt has been repaid at the stipulated time, the mortgagee shall 
re-transfer the property to the mortgagor. 
 
 In case of mortgage by conditional sale, there is no personal covenant. 
That is unlike in the case of a simple mortgage, the mortgagor in this case 
does not bind himself personally to repay the debt. The mortgagee is not 
given the possession of the property in this type of mortgage. This is also 
the position in the case of a simple mortgage. Again, in a mortgage by 
conditional sale, the mortgagee‟s remedy is „foreclosure‟, that is he 
becomes the owner of the property in default of payment of the debt by the 
mortgagor, he has to institute a regular suit in a Court of law to "foreclose" 
the mortgage. To "foreclose" means to debar the mortgagor from 
redeeming the property forever. 
(c)  Usufractuary mortgage 
Section 58(d) defines a "usufructuary mortgage" as “where the mortgagor 
delivers possession or expressly or by implication binds himself to deliver possession 
of the mortgaged property to the mortgagee, and authorises him to retain such 
possession until payment of the mortgage money, and to receive the rents and profits 
accruing from the property or any part of such rents and profits and to appropriate the 
same in lieu of interest, or in payment of the mortgage money, or partly in lieu of 
interest or partly in payment of the mortgage money, the transaction is called an 
usufractuary mortgage. It is also called a mortgage with possession. 
Thus is this type of mortgage the mortgagor has to deliver possession of the 
property to the mortgagee. If the possession is not given, the mortgagee can sue for 
possession. The mere fact that possession has not been delivered will not alter the 
nature of the transaction. In Pratap Bahadur v. Gajadhar, 24 All 521, it was agreed 
that the mortgagee will put the mortgagor in possession of a village on a 
certain date and to pay interest till possession was delivered. It was held that 
mortgage was an usufructuary mortgage. The mortgagee is authorised to retain 
possession and receive rents, etc., until he recovers the whole debt and the interest. 
The usufractuary mortgagee has to look only to the profits that arise out of the 
property for realising his debt; there is no personal liability on the part of the 
mortgagor. Similarly, the mortgagee has no right to foreclose the mortgage or to sue 
for sale. 
A mortgage may be regarded as usufructuary even though the entire debt is not 
to be paid out of the profits of the property. Therefore, a usufractuary mortgage may 
be either (i) where the entire mortgage money is to be paid from the profit of the land; 
or (ii) where only part of the mortgage money is principal or interest amount is to be 
paid from the profit of the land. 
If in a usufractuary mortgage a time is mentioned during which the mortgagee 
should recover the debt, etc., then after the time is over, the mortgagee should 
EP-GCL-4 
246 
deliver back the property to the mortgagor. He cannot refuse to give back the 
property, if he has not been able to recover the debt and the interest, etc. A 
usufractuary mortgagee is supposed to remain in possession of the mortgaged 
property and manage the same as a person of ordinary prudence would manage 
subject to the conditions of mortgage agreement. Any loss due to failure on his part 
would be debited to his account (Panchanan Sharma v. B.P. Jagnani, SCALE 1995 
(2) 641). 
Thus, a usufractuary mortgage has the following characteristics: 
 
1. Possession of property must be delivered to the mortgagee; 
 
2. There is no personal liability on the part of the mortgagor to pay; 
 
3. The mortgagee is entitled to rents and profits in lieu of interest or principal 
or both; and 
 
4. The mortgagee however is not entitled to foreclose the mortgagee or to sue 
for sale. 
(d)  English mortgage 
Section 58(e) states that: “where the mortgagor binds himself to repay the 
mortgage money on a certain date, and transfers the mortgaged property absolutely 
to the mortgagee but subject to a proviso that he will retransfer it to the mortgagor 
upon payment of the money as agreed, the transaction is called an English 
mortgage”. 
Here the mortgagor transfers the ownership of the property as security and the 
mortgagee promises to re-transfer the ownership, if the money is paid within a 
definite time. There is also a personal covenant as the mortgagor promises to repay 
within a certain date. In this type of mortgage, there is proviso that if money is repaid 
the property would be reconveyed. The remedy of the mortgagee is sale of the 
property to recover the debt. Thus, the essential features of an English mortgage are 
as under: 
 
1. The mortgagor binds himself to repay the mortgage money on a certain 
day. In other words, there should be a personal undertaking to pay. 
 
2. The mortgaged property is absolutely transferred to the mortgagee. 
 
3. Such absolute transfer is subject to a proviso that the mortgagee will 
reconvey the property to the mortgagor upon payment by him of the 
mortgage money on the fixed day. 
Distinction between English mortgage and mortgage by conditional sale 
An English mortgage looks like a mortgage by conditional sale but there are 
obvious differences between the two: 
 
1. In English mortgage there is a personal liability undertaken by the 
mortgagor to pay the debt. In a mortgage by conditional sale there is no 
personal covenant (agreement for payment of the mortgage money and 
mortgagee has his remedy against the mortgaged property only; 
 
2. In English mortgage the ownership in the mortgaged property is absolutely 
transferred to the creditor (i.e. mortgagee) which however, may be divested 
on repayment of the loan on the fixed day.

In a mortgage by conditional sale, the mortgagee gets only a qualified ownership 
which may, however, ripen into an absolute ownership in default of payment of the 
mortgage money.

In which of the following mortgages, the ownership in the mortgaged property is 
absolutely transferred to the creditor? 
 (a) Simple mortgage 
 (b) English mortgage 
 (c) Anomalous mortgage 
 (d) Usufructuary mortgage 
Correct Answer: (b) 
 
(e)  Mortgage by deposit of title deeds 
This type of mortgage is called equitable mortgage in English law. In this 
transaction, a person delivers to the creditor or his agent documents of title of his 
immoveable property with an intention to create a security, and obtains a loan. The 
requisites of such a mortgage are (i) a debt, (ii) deposit of title deeds, and (iii) an 
intention that the deeds shall be security for the debt. 
In order that a valid mortgage on an immoveable property should be effected, it 
must be in writing and attested by two witnesses and the document must be 
registered. But in case of a mortgage by deposit of title deeds, it need not be 
registered and an oral agreement between the person and the creditor followed by 
the delivery of the documents of title to the property is enough. The creditor will have 
the possession of the documents and he will advance the money at the stipulated 
rate of interest. In case the mortgagor does not repay the loan, the creditor on the 
basis of having the title deeds in his possession can sue the debtor to recover the 
money. This type of mortgage has been recognized due to expediency. Many 
persons, specially the business people, may need money urgently and they cannot 
wait till a formal document is written, signed, attested and then registered. So they 
will simply approach the creditor and hand over the title deeds of their property and 
borrow money. This avoids delay and other formalities for effecting a valid mortgage. 
There must be a clear intention on the part of the person who hands over the title 
deeds to effect a valid mortgage. In the absence of any intention, the mere holding in 
possession of the title deeds will not create a valid mortgage. 
The term „documents of title‟ or title deeds means such documents as will show 
prima facie or apparent title to the property of the person who is borrowing money. 
Accordingly, in one case it was held that tax receipt was not a document of title to the 
property on which the tax was paid. What is necessary to deposit is a document 
which gives him his right to the property and the creditor should insist on the 
production of this document before he gives money on a pledge of documents. 
EP-GCL-4 
248 
It should be noted that this type of mortgage can be created only in certain towns 
and not everywhere in India. The facility to create a valid mortgage is available in the 
following towns in India: Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, Adoni, Ajmer, Allahabad, Alwar, 
Bangalore, 
Bellary, 
Cochin, 
Coimbatore, 
Delhi, 
Jaipur, 
Jodhpur, 
Kanpur, 
Rajahmundry, 
Udaipur, 
Vellor, 
Ellora, 
Pali, 
Bhilwara, 
Bikaner, 
Kakinada, 
Narayanganj, Mysore, and Madurai. Though this type of mortgage is limited to 
specific cities it is at par with any other legal mortgage (K.J. Nathan v. S.V. Maruthi 
Rao, A.I.R. 1965 S.C. 443). 
Title deeds should be delivered in these areas, the property of the person may be 
situated elsewhere. If the deposit of title deeds has taken place in any other town, it 
will not be a valid mortgage. Similarly, if the property is situated in any one of the 
towns mentioned above, but the deposit of title deeds is made in other towns or areas 
then again it will not be a valid mortgage. 
(f)  Anomalous mortgage 
Section 58(g) of the Transfer of Property Act provides that “a mortgage which is 
not a simple mortgage, a mortgage by conditional sale, usufrauctuary mortgage, an 
English mortgage, or a mortgage by deposit of title deeds within the meaning of this 
section is called an anomalous mortgage”. 
Thus, an anomalous mortgage is a combination of various other mortgages, for 
example, a usufractuary mortgage may be created and the mortgagee shall have the 
right of sale. You have already noticed that in a usufractuary mortgage only 
possession is given to the mortgagee and there is no right of sale. But in an 
anomalous mortgage the right of sale along with the possession of the property may 
be given. You have also seen that in the case of usufractuary mortgage, there is no 
personal liability on the part of a mortgagor but if the mortgagor assumes personal 
liability to pay the mortgage money, it will be an anomalous mortgage. 
Again, a mortgagee may be given possession of the property for a fixed period 
with a condition that in case the debt is not discharged at the expiry of the period 
mentioned, the mortgage shall be regarded as a mortgage by conditional sale. In this 
case, the mortgage has got a right of "foreclosure" and after the expiry of the period if 
the debt is not paid, the mortgagee will become the owner of the property. 
Two other terms in common use in connection with mortgage may be considered 
here. These terms are (i) Sub-mortgage; and (ii) Puisne mortgage. 
(v)  Sub-mortgage: Where the mortgagee transfers by mortgage his interest in 
the mortgaged property, or creates a mortgage of a mortgage the transaction is 
known as a sub-mortgage. For example, where A mortgages his house to B for Rs. 
10,000 and B mortgage his mortgagee right to C for Rs. 8,000. B creates a sub-
mortgage. 
(vi)  Puisne mortgage: Where the mortgagor, having mortgaged his property, 
mortgages it to another person to secure another loan, the second mortgage is called 
a puisne mortgage. For example, where A mortgages his house worth Rs. one lakh to 
B for Rs. 40,000 and mortgages the same house to C for a further sum of Rs. 30,000, 
the mortgage to B is first mortgage and that to C the second or puisne mortgage. C is 
the puisne mortgagee, and can recover the debt subject to the right of B, the first 
mortgagee, to recover his debt of Rs. 40,000 plus interest.

Choose the correct answer 
Which of the following mortgages is called equitable mortgage in English law? 
 (a) Simple mortgage 
 (b) English mortgage 
 (c) Anomalous mortgage 
 (d) Mortgage by deposit of title deeds 
Correct Answer: (d) 
 
(vii)  Rights of mortgagor:  By mortgaging the property the mortgagor does not 
cease to be its owner, he only transfers an interest in it. The law, therefore, grants 
him the following rights: 
 (a) Right of redemption:  The first and the most important right of the 
mortgagor is the right to redeem i.e., take back the mortgaged property by 
paying the mortgage money at any time after the stipulated date for 
repayment. Section 60 of the Act provides that any time after the principal 
amount has become due, the mortgagor has a right to redeem the property. 
Although the Act gives him the right to redeem “any time” after their debt 
has become due, it enjoins upon the mortgagor the obligation to exercise 
this right (i) before the right is extinguished by the  Act of parties or by a 
decree of Court, or (ii) before it is barred by the Limitation Act. According to 
the Law of Limitation the, mortgagor can redeem the property within 60 
years after the money has become due. This right to redeem the property 
even after the time of payment has  elapsed is called the Right or Equity or 
Redemption. But the mortgagor is not entitled to redeem before the 
mortgage money becomes due on the date fixed for repayment of the loan. 
His right to redeem arises only when mortgage money becomes due and 
not before. 
 
 Let us take an example to illustrate this point. A borrows money on a 
mortgage and agrees to pay it back after 5 years. A has won a lottery  and 
wants to pay the loan at the end of 3 years and redeem his property. He 
cannot do so, because the right to redeem arises only when the money has 
become due at the end of 5 years. This is so because the mortgagee 
cannot file a suit against the mortgagor for the repayment of the loan. That 
is why it is said that the rights of the mortgagor and the mortgagee are co-
extensive. 
 (b) Right against clog on equity of redemption: Right of redemption or equity of 
redemption is the essence of a mortgage, and any provision inserted in the 
mortgage deed to prevent, evade or hamper redemption is void. Any 
condition which prevents the mortgagor from redeeming the property is 
called a “clog” on the equity or right of redemption and is void. The rule of 
equity that once a mortgage always a mortgage prohibits a clog on the right 
EP-GCL-4 
250 
of redemption. In other words, once a transaction is found to be a 
mortgage, the Court would not permit any condition in a mortgage deed 
which would prevent or impede redemption or repayment of the loan for 
which the security was given. For example, A borrows money on a 
mortgage from B and agrees to pay back the loan after 5 years. In the 
mortgage deed it is also stipulated that in default of redemption on a 
particular day the mortgage would be renewed for another period of 5 
years, that is to say, that mortgagor shall not redeem the property before 
the expiry of 10 years. This stipulation is a clog on redemption and is void 
as the provision gave a right of redemption for one day only in 10 years. A 
condition requiring payment at higher rate of interest in the event of 
mortgagor‟s failure to pay at the expiry of the stipulated time is invalid being 
a clog on equity of redemption; (Sunder Kaur v. Sham Krishan, (64 I.A. 9). 
Other Illustrations 
 
(a) A stipulation that the mortgagor shall not alienate the mortgaged 
property and that he could redeem that mortgage only by paying money 
out of his own pocket and not by money raised by transfer of property 
was held to be a clog (Ram Saran Lal v. Amrit Kaur, 3 All. 369). 
 
(b) A mortgage deed provided that if the mortgage money was not paid at 
a certain time, the mortgagee might enter into possession for a period 
of twelve years and that mortgagors right to redeem would remain 
suspended for that period. It was held the condition was a clog and 
therefore unenforceable (Mohd. Sher Khan v. Seth Swami Dayal, 49 
I.A. 60). 
 
(c) A deed of mortgage of shares of a company contained a clause 
whereby the mortgagee was to have the exclusive right of selling the 
company‟s tea as its broker. It was held as a clog on the equity of 
redemption (Bradley v. Carrit (1903) A.C. 253). 
 
(d) A mortgage deed provided that in case the payment was not made by 
the mortgagor within the stipulated period, the mortgagee would 
become the absolute owner of the property. It was held to be a clog on 
the equity of redemption. 
 
 Where, however, the condition is reasonable and does not prevent the 
mortgagor to redeem the property it will be recognised as valid and 
binding. For example, A mortgages his paddy field and borrows money 
from B, the mortgage being with possession (usufructuary mortgage). 
There is a condition in the mortgage deed that the mortgagor shall not 
redeem in the harvesting or cultivating season. The condition is 
reasonable, because if the mortgagor is allowed to redeem during 
harvesting season, it will cause some difficulty to the mortgagee. 
 
 Similarly, a condition that the mortgagor cannot redeem the 
mortgage for a certain number of years is valid and enforceable. 
Thus, in Knightbridge Estate Trust Limited v. Bysue, 1929 Ch. 441, 
it was agreed that the mortgagor could pay off the debt in 40 
years. It was held that such contract was not a clog on the equity 
of redemption. 
 
EP-GCL-4 
251 
 (c) Right of partial redemption: A mortgage, as a rule, being one and indivisible 
for the debt and every part of it, the mortgagor cannot redeem piecemeal; 
he must redeem the whole property. But Section 61 of the Act gives a right 
of partial redemption stating that “a mortgagor who has executed two or 
more mortgages in favour of the same mortgagee shall, in the absence of a 
contract to the contrary, when the principal money of any two or more of the 
mortgages has become due, be entitled to redeem any one such mortgage 
separately or any two or more of such mortgages together.” 
Illustrations  
 (a) A mortgages property X to B and obtains a loan of Rs. 2,000. A again 
mortgages the same property to B and obtains a further loan of Rs. 1,000. 
A can redeem the first mortgage of Rs. 2,000 or he can redeem both 
together. 
 (b) A mortgages property X to B and obtains a loan of Rs. 10,000. He then 
mortgages his property Y and obtains a loan of Rs. 10,000. He may redeem 
either property X or Y by paying the loan. The mortgagee cannot insist that 
A should redeem both mortgages together. 
(viii)  Implied contract by mortgagor.  The parties are free to enter into any terms 
they like. Where, however, the contract does not contain all the terms, Section 65 
provides for implied terms as follows: 
In the absence of a contract to the contrary, the mortgagor shall be deemed to 
have contracted with the mortgagee that the : 
 (a) mortgagor is entitled to transfer the interest (covenant for title); 
 (b) mortgagor will assist the mortgagee to enjoy quiet possession; 
 (c) mortgagor will pay public charges in respect of the mortgaged property; 
 (d) mortgagor covenants as to payment of the rent due on lease where, the 
mortgaged property is leased; 
 (e) mortgagor covenants as to payments of interest and principal on prior 
encumbrances, where the mortgage is a second or subsequent 
encumbrance on the property. 
Illustration 
 (a) A mortgagor fails to pay the Government revenue in respect of mortgaged 
property in time. The property had to be sold for arrears in Government 
revenue and the mortgagor himself purchases the property as a revenue 
sale. Thereafter, he executes another mortgage of the same property. Held 
that the original mortgage is not extinguished and he is liable to the first 
mortgagee. A mortgagor cannot take advantage of the breach of his 
obligation (Sonogopally v. Intoory, 26 Mad. 385). 
(ix)  Rights of mortgagee and his remedies:  If the mortgagor does not pay the 
mortgage money, the mortgagee may proceed to recover (i) from the mortgaged 
property, or (ii) sue for recovery from the mortgagor personally. Thus the mortgagor 
has two remedies: one against the property and the other against the mortgagor 
personally. 
EP-GCL-4 
252 
 (a) Remedies against the property:  The remedies of the mortgagee against 
the property are: 
 
(i) Right to bring property to sale. 
 
(ii) Right to foreclose. 
 
(iii) Right to the possession of the property. 
 
(i) Remedy by sale:  In case of a simple mortgage or a mortgage by deposit of 
title deeds or equitable mortgage, or an English mortgage, sale is the only 
remedy available to the mortgagee. He has to file a suit for sale of the 
mortgaged property and if the Court is satisfied, it would give 6 months time 
to the mortgagor to pay the decretal amount. If he fails to pay, the 
mortgagee will get a final decree under which he can have the  property 
sold. If the proceeds are more than the decretal amount, the balance, after 
payment to the mortgagee, will be paid to the mortgagor, and if the 
proceeds fall short, then a personal decree for the balance will be given 
against the mortgagor. 
 (ii) Foreclosure:  The second remedy is foreclosure, by means of a suit to get a 
decree that the mortgagor shall be absolutely debarred of his right to  
redeem the property, if the mortgagor does not pay within the period 
directed by the Court. After a foreclosure decree is passed the mortgagee 
becomes the owner of the property. This remedy is available only in the 
case of mortgage by conditional sale, or in any anomalous mortgage. 
 (iii) Possession: A usufructuary mortgagee has a right to file a suit for 
possession and by use of the property he can repay himself the debt due 
on him. He can retain possession until his debt is discharged out of the 
income of the property. Hence, where possession is not given by the 
mortgagor, the mortgagee sues for possession. 
 (iv) Right to sue for mortgage money:  According to Section 68, the mortgagee 
has a right to sue for the mortgage money in the following cases and not 
others: 
 
(a) where the mortgagor binds himself to repay the same; 
 
(b) where, by any cause other than the wrongful act or default of the 
mortgagor or mortgagee, the mortgage property is destroyed or the 
security is rendered insufficient; 
 
(c) where the mortgagee is deprived of the whole or part of his security by 
or in consequence of the wrongful act or default of the mortgagor; 
 (v) where the mortgagee, being entitled to the possession of the property 
(usufructuary mortgage), is not put in possession of it, or where having 
been put in possession, is dispossessed by the mortgagor or any other 
person claiming under a superior title, e.g., a buyer by a registered deed. 
 (vi) Right of private sale:  By virture of Section 69, a mortgagee can sell the 
property without the intervention of the Court if, the loan is not paid on a 
certain date, in the following cases: 
 
(a) where the mortgage is an English mortgage and neither the mortgagor 
nor the mortgagee is a Hindu, Mohammedan or Buddhist; or 
 
(b) where the mortgagee is the Government and the mortgage deed 
confers an express power of sale; or 
 
EP-GCL-4 
253 
 
(c) where the mortgage property was on the date of execution of the 
mortgage situated within the towns of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, or 
in any other town or area which the State Government may specify in 
this behalf and the mortgage-deed confers an express power of sale. 
Section 69(2) prescribes certain conditions to be observed before the power can 
be exercised. These conditions are imperative and cannot be varied even by 
agreement between the parties to the mortgage. 
This right of private sale shall not be exercised unless and until: 
 (a) notice in writing requiring payment of the principal money has been served 
on the mortgagor and default has been made in payment of the principal 
money or of part thereof, for three months after such service or 
 (b) some interest under the mortgage amounting at least to five hundred 
rupees in arrear and unpaid for three months after becoming due. 
The sale proceeds under a private sale must be utilised, first in discharging prior 
encumbrances, if any, secondly, on payment of all costs, charges and expenses of 
the sale; thirdly, the non-payment of the debt; and finally, the surplus to be paid to the 
person entitled to the mortgage property. 
(x) Liabilities of the mortgagee in possession:  According to Section 76, a 
mortgagee in possession is bound: 
 (a) to manage the property as a person of ordinary prudence would manage 
his own; 
 (b) to use his best endeavours to collect the rents and profits thereof; 
 (c) to pay out of the income all Government revenue or other charges of a 
public nature; 
 (d) not to commit any act which is destructive to the property; 
 (e) to keep full and accurate accounts of all income and expenditure; and 
 
(f) when the mortgagor tenders or deposits the mortgage money, to account 
for his receipts from the property from the date of tender or deposited etc. 
(xi)  Priority:  The general rule of priority of different mortgages on the same 
property is that the successive mortgage is paid after the prior mortgage has been 
satisfied. Thus, if two successive mortgages are created by mortgagor on the same 
property, and both cannot be satisfied out of the mortgaged property, the prior 
mortgagee will have the first right to satisfy his whole debt and the balance, if any, will 
go to the subsequent mortgagee. But where the prior mortgages suffers from fraud, 
misrepresentation or gross neglect, the subsequent mortgage shall have priority over 
prior mortgagee, or of any other person who has for consideration acquired an 
interest in any of the properties. 
(xii)  Marshalling:  According to Section 81, if the owner of two or more properties 
mortgages them to one person and then mortgages one or more of the properties to 
another person, the subsequent mortgagee is, in the absence of a contract to the 
contrary, entitled to have the prior mortgage-debt satisfied out of the property or 
properties not mortgaged to him, so far as the same will extend, but not so as to 
prejudice the rights of the prior mortgagee. 
EP-GCL-4 
254 
Illustration 
A mortgages properties X and Y to B. Then he mortgages property Y to C. 
Suppose B obtains a decree on his mortgage for the sale of properties X and Y which 
form security for his mortgage. Suppose further that B apples in execution to the 
Court for sale of property Y which is also mortgaged to C, C would be entitled to have 
the prior debt of B satisfied out of property X, and if the whole debt is not satisfied out 
of property X then and then alone, the property Y should be proceeded against B. 
(xiii)  Subrogation:  Section 91 of the T.P. Act, enumerates the persons who may 
sue for redemption. The primary right to redemption is given to the mortgagor under 
Section 60, but in addition to the mortgagor certain other persons are also entitled to 
redeem or institute a suit for redemption of the mortgaged property, namely : 
 (a) any person who has any interest in, or charge upon, the property 
mortgaged or in or upon the right to redeem the same; 
 (b) any surety for the payment of the mortgage-debt; or 
 (c) any creditor of the mortgagor who has in a suit for the administration of his 
estate obtained a decree for sale of the mortgaged property. 
Section 92 incorporates the principle of "subrogation". It provides that any of the 
persons referred to in Section 91 (other than the mortgagor) and any co-mortgagor 
shall, on redeeming property subject to the mortgage, have so far as regards 
redemption, foreclosure or sale of such property, the same rights as the mortgagee 
whose mortgage he redeems may have against the mortgagor or any other 
mortgagee. The right conferred by this Section is called the "right of subrogation", 
and a person acquiring the same is said to be subrogated to the rights of the 
mortgagee whose mortgage he redeems. 
A person who has advanced to a mortgagor money with which the mortgage has 
been redeemed shall be subrogated to the rights of the mortgagee whose mortgage 
has been redeemed, if the mortgagor has by a registered instrument agreed that 
such person shall be so subrogated. 
Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to confer a right of subrogation on any 
person unless the mortgage in respect of which the right is claimed has been 
redeemed in full. 
7.  Charges 
Meaning of charge:  "Charge" has been defined under Section 100 as follows:  
“Where immoveable property of one person is by the act of parties or operation of law 
made security for the payment of money to another, and the transaction does not 
amount to a mortgage, the latter person is said to have a charge on the property”. 
As is evident from the above definition, a charge comes into existence either by 
the act of parties or by operation of law. 
Charge by act of parties:  When in a transaction for value, both the parties 
(debtor and creditor) intend that the property existing or future shall be made 
available as security for the payment of a debt and that the creditor shall have a 
present right to have it made available, there is a charge.

Illustrations 
 (a) A inherited an estate from his grandfather and executed an agreement to 
pay his sister B a fixed annual sum out of the rents of estate. B has a 
charge on the estate. 
 (b) In a suit by A against B on the basis of a promissory note, the amount 
decreed was to be paid by instalments and B was not to dispose of his 
share in a company until the satisfaction of the decretal amount. Held, a 
charge was on B‟s share in the company and A was entitled to have the 
amount from the property even though B had sold his share to a third 
person. 
 (c) Hypothecation of property though not necessarily accompanied by 
possession of the property, does create a charge in favour of the creditor 
bank (HMT v. Nedungadi Bank Ltd. & Anr., AIR 1995 Kant 185). 
Charge by operation of law:  Charges created by law are those which arise on 
account of some statutory provisions. They are not created by the voluntary action of 
the parties but arise as a result of some legal obligation. 
Illustrations 
 (a) W files a suit against her husband H for maintenance. The Court grants a 
decree awarding the wife Rs. 100 per month, and in case of default by the 
husband makes his property liable for the amount of maintenance. Here a 
charge is created over the husband‟s property. 
 (b) An unpaid vendor has a charge on the property sold. 
 (c) A co-mortgagor redeeming the mortgage is entitled to claim contribution 
and acquires a charge in respect thereof. 
Floating charge:  A charge may be floating as well as fixed. A fixed charge is a 
charge on specific property but a floating charge is an equitable charge on the assets 
for time being of a going concern. It is peculiar to companies which are able to borrow 
money without any interference with their assets so long as they are going concern. 
In other words, it is a charge on a class of the assets of the company, present as well 
as future. The assets of the company are constantly undergoing a change but the 
creditors will not normally interfere with the assets of the company unless there is 
breach of some condition. As Professor Gower says, the assets are liquid and the 
charge is floating. It is ambulatory and shifting in its nature hovering over and so to 
speak floating with the property which it is intended to effect. As it does not attach to 
any specific property, it remains document until it crystallises. 
A floating charge has the following characteristics: 
 
1. It is a charge on class of assets both present and future. 
 
2. The class of assets charged is one which in the ordinary 
course of business would be changing from time to time. 
 
3. It is contemplated by the charge that until some future step is taken by 
those who are interested in the charge the company may carry on its 
business in the ordinary way, i.e., it may use its assets charged in the 
EP-GCL-4 
256 
? 
ordinary course of its business. (Per Roman L.J. in Reyork Shive Wool 
Combers Associated Limited, (1903) 2 Ch. 284) A floating charge is 
created by debentures on the company’s undertaking or its estate, 
property and effects. It is not necessary that the charge should be on 
all company’s assets. Thus a mortgage of a cinema and of the chattels 
used in the cinema premises was held to be a floating charge as to the 
chattles (National Provisional Bank of England Limited v. Charteb 
Electric Theatres Limited, (1916) Ch. 132). Similarly, a floating charge 
was created by a mortgage of book and other debts which shall become 
due during the continuance of this security (Reyork Shive Wool Combers 
Association, Supra). 
Crystallisation of floating charge 
A floating charge becomes fixed or crystallises in the following cases: 
 
1. When the money becomes payable under a condition in the debenture and 
the debenture holder, (i.e., the creditor) takes some steps to enforce the 
security; 
 
2. When the company ceases to carry on business; and 
 
3. When the company is being wound-up.

Correct Answer: True 
 
8.  Distinction between Mortgage and Charge 
Although in a charge, the property is made a security for the payment of the loan, 
yet the transaction does not amount to mortgage. It is important, therefore to 
distinguish between a charge and mortgage. 
 (a) A mortgage is transfer of an interest in the property made by the mortgagor 
as a security for the loan, while the charge is not the transfer of any interest 
in the property though it is security for the payment of an amount. 
 (b) A charge may be created by act of parties or by operation of law. A 
mortgage can only be created by act of parties. 
 (c) A mortgage deed must be registered and attested by two witnesses, while a 
charge need not be made in writing, and if reduced to writing, it need not be 
attested or registered. 
 (d) In certain types of mortgage (viz., mortgage by conditional sale and 
 
EP-GCL-4 
257 
anomalous mortgage) the mortgagor can foreclose the mortgaged property 
but in charge, the charge-holder cannot foreclose though he can get the 
property sold as in a simple mortgage. 
 (e) From the very nature of it, a charge as a general rule, cannot be enforced against 
a transferee for consideration without notice. But in a mortgage, the transferee of 
mortgaged property from the mortgagor, can only acquire the remaining interest of 
the mortgagor, and is therefore, only bound by the mortgage. 
 
(f) In a charge created by act of parties the specification of the particular fund 
or property negatives a personal liability and the remedy of the charge-
holder is against the property only. In a mortgage, there can be security as 
well as personal liability. In fact, the absence of a personal liability is the 
principal test that distinguishes a charge from a simple mortgage. 
    
LESSON ROUND-UP 
 
 
The law relating to transfer of property is governed by the Transfer of Property 
Act, 1882. „Transfer of Property‟ means an act by which a living person conveys 
property, in present or future, to one or more other living persons, or to himself, 
and one or more other living persons. „living person‟ includes a company or 
association or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not. 
 
Every person who is competent to contract and entitled to transferable property, 
or authorized to dispose of property is competent to transfer such property. 
Property can be transferred either orally or by writing. Moveable property can be 
transferred by delivery of possession or by registration. In the case of tangible 
immoveable property of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards, or in the 
case of a reversion or other intangible thing, transfer can be made only by a 
registered instrument. In the case of tangible immoveable property of a value less 
than one hundred rupees, such transfer may be made either by a registered 
instrument or by delivery of the property. 
 
When property is transferred, the transferee should not be restrained absolutely 
from alienating the property. One may give property to another subject to a 
condition, but the condition should not be one which absolutely prevents the 
transferee from alienating the property. A transfer may also be made subject to a 
contingency which may or may not occur. This is known as condition subsequent. 
Condition subsequent is one which destroys or divests the rights upon the 
happening or non-happening of an event.  
 
Section 35 of the Transfer of Property Act deals with what is called doctrine of 
election. Election may be defined as “the choosing between two rights where 
there is a clear intention that both were not intended to be enjoyed”. The 
foundation of doctrine of election is that a person taking the benefit of an 
instrument must also bear the burden, and he must not take under and against 
the same instrument. 
EP-GCL-4 
258 
 
Where, with the consent, express of implied, of the persons interested in 
immoveable property, a person is the ostensible owner of such property and 
transfers the same for consideration, the transfer shall not be voidable on the 
ground that the transferor was not authorized to make it, provided that the 
transferee, after taking reasonable care to ascertain that the transferor had power 
to make the transfer, has acted in good faith. This is called doctrine of Holding 
Out. 
 
Doctrine of Feeding the Grant by Estoppel means where, a person fraudulently or 
erroneously represents that he is authorized to transfer certain immoveable 
property and professes to transfer such property for consideration, such transfer 
shall, at the option of the transferee, operate on any interest which the transferor 
may acquire in such property at any time during which the contract of transfer 
subsists. 
 
Where a person transfers his property so that his creditors shall not have 
anything out of the property, the transfer is called a fraudulent transfer. A debtor 
in order to defeat or delay the rights of a creditor, may transfer his property to 
some person, who may be his relative or a friend. The law does not allow this. 
 
The Act does not allow accumulation of income from the land for an unlimited 
period without the income-being enjoyed by owner of the property. The law 
allows accumulation of income for a certain period only. The period for which 
such accumulation is valid is : (a) the life of the transferor, or (b) eighteen years 
from the date of transfer. Any direction to accumulate the income beyond the 
period mentioned above is void. However, this is subject to certain exceptions. 
 
Lis pendens means a pending suit, action, petition or the like. Section 52 of the 
T.P. Act incorporates the doctrine of Lis pendens. It states that during the 
pendency of a suit in a court of law, property which is subject to a litigation cannot 
be transferred. 
 
The Act expressly provides for special types of transfers such as sale, exchange, 
gift, mortgage and lease. In a sale, exchange and gift, there is a transfer of the 
ownership of property but mortgage is a transfer of an interest in specific 
immovable property and lease is a transfer of the right to enjoy immoveable 
property. 
 
Actionable claims are claims, to unsecured debts. If a debt is secured by the 
mortgage of immoveable property it is not an actionable claim, because the 
Section clearly excludes such a debt. 
 
Charge under the Act has been defined as “where immoveable property of one 
person is by the act of parties or operation of law made security for the payment 
of money to another, and the transaction does not amount to a mortgage, the 
latter person is said to have a charge on the property”. 
 
As is evident from the above definition, a charge comes into existence either by 
the act of parties or by operation of law. A charge may be floating as well as 
fixed. A fixed charge is a charge on specific property but a floating charge is an 
equitable charge on the assets for time being of a going concern. It is peculiar to 
companies which are able to borrow money without any interference with their 
assets so long as they are going concerns.

STUDY V 
LAW RELATING TO STAMPS 
 
 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
The Indian Stamp Act, 1899 is a fiscal legislation dealing with tax on transactions. The 
tax is levied on in the shape of stamps recording the transactions. In our country, 
documents are often executed without proper legal advice and lawyers are faced with 
a difficult situation when they find that the document to be put in the court is not 
properly stamped. Sometimes people are unduly taxed by over zealous officers. 
Therefore, it is essential for the students to be familiar with the law relating to stamp 
duties.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The Indian Stamp Act, 1899 is the law relating to stamps which consolidates and 
amends the law relating to stamp duty. It is a fiscal legislation envisaging levy of 
stamp duty on certain instruments. The Act is divided into eight Chapters and there is 
a schedule which contains the rates of stamp duties on various instruments.  
(a) Union List 
Union List, Entry 91 gives power to the Union Legislature to levy stamp duty with 
regard to certain instruments (mostly of a commercial character). They are bill of 
exchange, cheques, promissory notes, bill of lading, letters of credit, policies of 
insurance, transfer of shares, debentures, proxies and receipt. The power to reduce 
or remit duties on these instruments is vested in the Union Government as per 
Section 9 of the Act.  
(b) The State Legislature 
State List, entry 63 confers on the States power to prescribe the rates of stamp 
duties on other instruments. As per ―Principles‖ for levy of duty fall in the Concurrent 
List, entry 44.  
(c) Amendments, entry 44 
The amendments to the Central Act effected by the States are in the shape of 
amendment of sections of the Central Act, adding new sections, adding separate 
schedules, modifying in schedules, etc. Some States, for their convenience, have 
passed separate legislation to cover the matters coming under State‘s domain. As a 
result, the rates of stamp duties in different States on other instruments category 
differ from State to State for the same instrument.  
2. IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS 
Section 2 of the Act contains definitions of various terms used in the Act. Some 
important definitions are discussed below: 
Banker  
―Banker‖ includes a bank and any person acting as a banker [Section 3 of the 
Negotiable Instruments Act defines a banker as including persons or a corporation or 
company acting as bankers]. [Section 2(1)] 
Bill of Lading 
―Bill of Lading‖ includes a ‗through bill lading‘ but does not include a mate‘s 
receipt. [Section 2(4)] 
A bill of lading is a receipt by the master of a ship for goods delivered to him for 
delivery to X or his assigns. Three copies are made, each signed by the master. One 
is kept by the consignor of the goods, one by the master of the ship and one is 
forwarded to X, the consignee, who, on receipt of it, acquires property in the goods. It 
is a written evidence of a contract for the carriage and delivery of goods by sea, for 
certain freight.  
EP-GCL-5 
262 
When goods are delivered on board a ship, the receipt is given by the person 
incharge at that time. This receipt is known as the mate‘s receipt. The shipper of the 
goods returns this receipt to the master before the ship leaves and receives from him 
bill of lading for the goods, signed by the master.  
Conveyance 
The term ―conveyance‖ includes a conveyance on sale and every instrument by 
which property (whether movable or immovable) is transferred inter vivos1 and which 
is not otherwise specifically provided for by Schedule. It does not include a will. 
[Section 2(10)] 
Thus, all transfers of property whether movable or immovable, on sale (which are 
not otherwise specially provided for by the Schedule), are chargeable as 
conveyances. Transfers which are otherwise provided for in the Schedule are 
Composition Deed, Exchange of Property, Gift, Lease, Mortgage, Reconveyance, 
Release, Settlement, Transfer, Transfer of Lease and (Declaration of) Trust.  
Instrument 
Section 2(14) defines an ―instrument‖ to include every document by which any 
right or liability is, or purports to be, created, transferred, limited, extended, 
extinguished or recorded. The definition is an inclusive definition, and is not 
necessarily restricted to those documents which are specifically mentioned in the 
definition. Briefly stated, an instrument includes conveyances, leases, mortgages, 
promissory notes and wills, but not ordinary letters or memoranda or accounts.  
Following instances may be noted: 
 
(i) An unsigned draft document is not an ―instrument‖ (because it does not 
create or purport to create any right, etc). 
 (ii) An entry in a register, containing the terms of hiring of machinery is an 
―instrument‖, where it is authenticated by the thumb impression of the hirer. 
(Reason is, that it purports to create, a liability etc.) 
 (iii) A letter which acknowledges receipt of a certain sum as having been 
borrowed at a particular rate of interest and for a particular period and that 
it will be repaid with interest on the due date is an ―instrument‖.  
 
 [These examples show, that the law looks to the substance and effect (or 
intended effect) of the text of the instrument and not the physical medium 
through which it is recorded.] 
 (iv) Photocopy of an agreement is not an instrument as defined under Section 
2(14) of the Act. Ashok Kalam Capital Builders v. State & Anr., AIR 2010 
(NOC) 736 (Del). 
Executed / Execution 
Under Section 1(12), the words ―executed‖ and ―execution‖ (used with 
reference to instruments), mean ―signed‖ and ―signature‖ respectively.  
Signature includes mark by an illiterate person. [Section 3(52), General 
Clauses Act, 1897] 
                                                     
1. The expression “inter vivos” means during lifetime. 
 
EP-GCL-5 
263 
An instrument which is chargeable with stamp duty only on being ―executed‖ is 
not liable to stamp duty until it is signed.  
The Collector can receive the stamp duty without penalty and certify an 
instrument as duly stamped, as from the date of execution. (Sections 37 and 40)  
Impressed Stamp 
According to Section 2(13), ―impressed stamp‖ includes: 
 (a) labels affixed and impressed by the proper officer; and 
 (b) stamps embossed or engraved on stamp paper.  
The rules framed under the Act invariably prescribe to what documents 
impressed stamps are to be used. The term includes both a stamp impressed 
by the Collector and also a stamp embossed on stamp paper. Special 
adhesive stamps are labels (Ganga Devi v. State of Bihar, 1 LR 45 Pat. 198).  
The instrument is duly stamped if it has been duly stamped at the time 
of execution and is admissible in evidence, though the stamp is 
subsequently removed or lost (Mt. Mewa Kunwari v. Bourey, AIR 1934 
All. 388).  
Bill of Exchange 
According to Section 2(2), ―bill of exchange‖ means a bill of exchange as 
defined in the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and includes also a Hundi and any 
other document entitling or purporting to entitle any person, whether named therein 
or not, to payment by any other person of, or to draw upon any other person for, 
any sum of money. The Negotiable Instruments Act, defines a ―bill of exchange‖ as 
an instrument in writing, containing an unconditional order signed by the maker, 
directing a certain person to pay a certain sum of money only to, or to the order of, 
a certain person or to the bearer of the instrument.  
Bill of exchange payable on demand 
Under Section 2(3) of the Stamp Act, a ―bill of exchange on demand‖ includes: 
 (a) an order for the payment of any sum of money by a bill of exchange or 
promissory note or for the delivery of any bill of exchange or promissory note 
in satisfaction of any sum of money, or in the payment of any sum of money 
out of any particular fund which may or may not be available, or upon any 
condition or contingency which may or may not be performed or happen;  
 (b) an order for the payment of any sum of money weekly, monthly or at any 
other said period; and 
 (c) a letter of credit, that is to say, any instrument by which one person 
authorises any other person to give credit to the person in whose favour it 
is drawn.  
It may be noted that a bill of exchange payable on demand includes even a 
letter of credit, as per above definition.  
EP-GCL-5 
264 
? 
Thus, the definition in the Stamp Act includes many instruments which could 
not be classed as ‗bills of exchange‘ within the definition given by the Negotiable 
Instruments Act, 1881. 
Cheque 
Under Section 2(7) of the Stamp Act, ―cheque‖ means a bill of exchange drawn 
on specified banker, not expressed to be payable otherwise than on demand. This 
definition follows the definition given in the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.  
It should be mentioned that in India, cheques are no longer subject to stamp 
duty. Entry 21 in the Schedule levying duty on cheque was deleted by Act 5 of 
1927.  
Bond 
Under Section 2(5), a ―bond‖ includes –  
 (a) any instrument whereby a person obliges himself to pay money to another 
on condition that the obligation shall be void if a specified act is performed, 
or is not performed, as the case may be; 
 (b) any instrument attested by a witness not payable to order or bearer, 
whereby a person obliges himself to pay money to another; and 
 (c) any instrument so attested, whereby a person obliges himself to deliver 
grain or other agricultural produce to another.  
The word ―oblige‖ has been used in all sub-clauses in the definition. Therefore, 
no document can be a bond unless it is one which, by itself, creates the obligation 
to pay the money. The words ―obliges himself to pay money‖ make it very clear, 
that the obligation is not a pre-existing one. Where the liability already exists it 
cannot be said that under a subsequent document (merely reproducing the nature 
of the obligation) an obligation has been created.

 (d) Marketable Security 
Correct answer: (a) 
 
Chargeable 
Under Section 2(6) ―chargeable‖ as applied to an instrument executed or first 
executed after the commencement of the Act means chargeable under the Act and 
 
EP-GCL-5 
265 
as applied to any other instrument, chargeable under the law in force in India when 
such instrument was executed or where several persons executed the instrument at 
different times, first executed.  
Lease 
―Lease‖ means a lease of immovable property and includes also: 
 (a) a patta; 
 (b) a kabuliyat or other undertaking in writing, not being a counterpart of a 
lease to cultivate, occupy or pay or deliver rent for, immovable property; 
 (c) any instrument by which tolls of any description are let;  
 (d) any writing on an application for a lease intended to signify that the 
application is granted. [Section 2(16)] 
Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act defines lease as a transfer of a right 
to enjoy such property, made for a certain time, expressed or implied, or in 
perpetuity, in consideration of a price paid or promised, or of money, a share of 
crops, service or any other thing of value to be rendered periodically or on specified 
occasions to the transferor by the transferee, who accepts the transfer on such 
terms.  
A patta is an instrument given by the Collector of District or any other receiver 
of the revenue, to the cultivator, specifying the condition or conditions upon which 
the lands are to be held and the value or proportion of the produce to be paid 
therefor.  
A Kabuliyat is executed by the lessee, accepting the terms of the lease and 
undertaking to abide by them. Although, it is not a lease under Section 105 of the 
Transfer of Property Act, it is expressly included in the definition for the purposes of 
the Stamp Act.  
Toll is a tax paid for some liberty or privilege, such as for passage over a 
bridge, ferry, along a highway or for the sale of articles in a market or fair or the 
like. It does not include ‗octroi’ or ‗chungi‘.  
Promissory Note 
It means a promissory note as defined by the Negotiable Instruments Act, 
1881. It also includes a note promising the payment of any sum of money out of a 
particular fund which may or may not be available, or upon any condition or 
contingency which may or may not be performed or happen. [Section 2(22)] 
Requisities of a promissory note as per the Negotiable Instruments 
Act, 1881 are the following: 
 
(a) the document must contain an unconditional undertaking to 
pay; 
 (b) the undertaking must be to pay money only;  
 (c) the money to be paid must be certain; 
 (d) it must be payable to or to the order of a certain person or to bearer; 
 (e) the document must be signed by the maker.  
EP-GCL-5 
266 
Illustrations 
An instrument in the form: 
―I do acknowledge myself to be indebted to B in Rs. 1,000 to be paid on 
demand for value received‖ is a promissory note.  
―I have received a sum of £20 which I borrowed from you and I have to be 
accountable for the sum with interest‖ held not to be a promissory note.  
―On demand I promise to pay to the trustees of W&C or their treasurer for the 
time being £100‖ was held a good promissory note.  
Receipt 
―Receipt‖ includes any note, memorandum or writing: 
 (a) whereby any money or any bill of exchange, cheque or promissory note is 
acknowledged to have been received; or 
 (b) whereby any other movable property is acknowledged to have been 
received in satisfaction of a debt; or 
 (c) whereby any debt or demand, or any part of a debt or demand is 
acknowledged to have been satisfied or discharged; or 
 (d) which signifies or imports any such acknowledgement, and whether the 
same is or is not signed with the name of any person. [Section 2(23)] 
A mere acknowledgement in writing of the receipt of immovable property will 
not attract sub-clause (b). Under sub-clause (c), any acknowledgement in 
satisfaction or discharge of any debt or demand or any part thereof is covered; for 
instance, a receipt given by the secretary or other manager of a club 
acknowledging payment of the club dues comes within the sub-clause.  
An ordinary cash memo issued by a shopkeeper or another person selling the 
goods or other merchandise is not a receipt, unless it contains an 
acknowledgement of receipt of the money.  
A letter acknowledging the receipt of money or cheque is a receipt. A document 
merely saying that the signatory has received a sum of Rs. 500 is a receipt.  
Settlement 
―Settlement‖ means any non-testamentary disposition, in writing, of movable or 
immovable property made: 
 (a) in consideration of marriage; 
 (b) for the purpose of distributing property of the settler among his family or 
those for whom he desires to provide, or for the purpose of providing for 
some person dependent on him; or 
 (c) for any religious or charitable purpose;  
and includes an agreement in writing to make such disposition. [Section 2(24)] 
The definition of ―settlement‖ excludes a will. A will is intended to operate only 
on death, while a settlement operates immediately.

Marketable Security 
Under Section 2(16A), ―marketable security‖ means a security of such a 
description as to be capable of being sold in stock market in India or in the United 
Kingdom. 
Stamp 
―Stamp‖ means any mark, seal or endorsement by any agency or person duly 
authorized by the State Government and includes an adhesive or impressed stamp 
for the purposes of duty chargeable under this Act. This definition of the stamp has 
been inserted by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2004.

Schedule as the proper duty therefor, namely: 
 (a) every instrument mentioned in that Schedule which, not having been 
previously executed by any person, is executed in India on or after the first 
day of July, 1899; 
 (b) every bill of exchange payable otherwise than on demand or promissory 
note drawn or made out of India on or after the date and accepted or paid, 
or presented for acceptance or payment, or endorsed, transferred or 
otherwise negotiated in India; and 
 (c) every instrument (other than a bill of exchange or promissory note) 
mentioned in that Schedule, which, not having been previously executed by 
any person, is executed out of India on or after that day and relates to any 
property situate, or to any matter or thing done or to be done in India and is 
received in India.  
However, no duty shall be chargeable in respect of: 
 
1. any instrument executed by or on behalf of or in favour of the Government, 
in cases where, but for this the Government would be liable to pay the duty 
chargeable in respect of such instrument.  
EP-GCL-5 
268 
 
2. any instrument for the sale, transfer or disposition, either absolutely or by 
way of mortgage or otherwise, of any ship or vessel or any part, interest, 
share of property of or in any ship or vessel registered under the Merchant 
Shipping Act, 1894 or under Act XIX of 1838 or the Indian Registration of 
Ships Act, 1841 as amended by subsequent Acts.  
 
 [The references to repealed Acts are now to be read as references to the 
corresponding re-enacting Act].  
 
3. Any instrument executed by, or, on behalf of, or in favour of, the Developer 
or Unit or in connection with the carrying out of purposes of the special 
Economic Zone. 
Explanation – For the purposes of this clause, the expressions ―Developer‖ 
―Special Economic Zone‖ and ―Unit‖ shall have meanings respectively assigned to 
them in Clauses (g), (za) and (zc) of Section 2 of the Special Economic Zones Act, 
2005.*  
Thus, Section 3 charges certain instruments to be liable to stamp duty.  
The Court has observed as under in Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. G. 
Angus, 1889) 23 QBD 579, followed in re Swadeshi Cotton Mills, AIR 1932 All 291, 
―the first thing to be noticed is that thing which is made liable to duty is an 
instrument. If a contract of purchase and sale or a conveyance by way of purchase 
and sale, can be, or is carried out without an instrument the case is not within the 
section and no tax is imposed. It is not the transaction of purchase and sale which 
is struck at; it is the instrument whereby the purchase and sale are effected which 
is struck at. And if any one carries through a purchase and sale without an 
instrument, then the Legislature has not reached that transaction‖.  
In re Swadeshi Cotton Mills, AIR 1932 All 291, it was held that if after entry into 
a contract of sale the parties (in spite of the risk that either 
party may resile from the contract), refrain from getting an 
actual deed of conveyance prepared, they can successfully 
evade the payment of higher duty. It is no argument that the 
Government 
loses 
revenue, 
if 
such 
a 
course 
is 
permitted**.
 
On this point Esher M.R., in Commissioners of Inland 
Revenue v. G. Angus, (1889) 23 QBD 579, stated that “goodwill can be sold 
and conveyed to purchasers without any „conveyance‟ being executed and if 
you treat the document as only an agreement with regard to the goodwill, 
there will never be any conveyance executed and the property would have 
been transferred to the purchaser without the Crown getting any ad valorem 
duty upon the transfer. If a vendor can convey the property sold to the 
purchaser without the execution of any instrument, he can convey it without 
paying any duty under Section 70. The subject may have the good fortune to 
escape the stamp duty, if he can get a conveyance of property sold to him 
without the execution of any instrument….. “The Crown ….. must make out its 
right to duty and if there be a means of evading the stamp duty, so much the 
better for those who can evade it”.  
                                                     
* Clause 3 mentioned above has been inserted by the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005. 
** However, in some States, local amendments have imposed heavy duty on agreements for sale.

Substance and description 
Courts have invariably upheld the principle of substance of the transaction, over 
the form, in the matter of deciding the nature of the instrument. The substance of 
the transaction contained in the document may not necessarily embody the 
description given at the head thereof.  
It is the substance of the transaction as contained in the instrument and not the 
form of the instrument, that determines the stamp duty, though the duty is leviable 
on the instrument and not on the transaction. In determining whether a document 
comes within the description of a document upon which a stamp is required by the 
Act, one has to look at the entire document to find out whether it falls within the 
description. Where a single instrument contains several purposes, the instrument 
as a whole should be read to find out its dominant purpose. To determine whether a 
document is sufficiently stamped the Court must look at the document itself, as it 
stands.  
4. EXTENT 
OF 
LIABILITY 
OF 
INSTRUMENTS 
TO 
DUTY 
(SEVERAL 
INSTRUMENTS IN SINGLE TRANSACTION OF SALE, MORTGAGE OR 
SETTLEMENT) 
Section 4 provides that, where in the case of any sale, mortgage or settlement, 
several instruments are employed for completing the transaction –  
 (a) only the principal instrument shall be chargeable with the duty prescribed 
for the conveyance, mortgage or settlement; and 
 (b) each of the other instruments shall be chargeable with a duty of one rupee 
(instead of the duty if any prescribed for the other instruments).  
Illustrations (Section 4 held applicable) 
 
(i) A executed a conveyance of immovable property. On the same deed his 
nephew (undivided in status) endorsed his consent to the sale, as such 
consent was considered to be necessary. It was held that the conveyance 
was the principal instrument. The consent was chargeable with only one 
rupee (ILR 13 Bom 281). 
 (ii) Subsequent to a sale of immovable property, two declarations were 
executed reciting that the sale was subject to an equitable mortgage 
created by the vendor. These declarations were held to be chargeable, 
together with the sale deed, as having completed the conveyance (Somaiya 
Organics Ltd. v. Chief Controlling Revenue Authority, AIR 1972 All 252). 
 (iii) Brother A executed in favour of brother B a gift of all his property. By 
another deed, brother B made provision for the living expenses of brotherA 
and hypothecating in favour of brother A a part of the property included in 
the above mentioned gift deed, in order to secure the payment of the living 
expenses. It was held that the two documents were part of the same 
transaction. They amounted to a settlement and Section 4 applied (Maharaj 
Someshar Dutt, ILR 37 All 264). 
 (iv) B conveyed the whole of his property to three persons who undertook to 
provide for him and to perform his obsequies. By another document, the 
EP-GCL-5 
270 
three donees agreed to provide for B. This was mentioned in the deed 
executed by A also. It was held that the two documents had to be construed 
as part of the same act; the first was liable to duty as a conveyance while 
the second was liable to a duty of Rupee 1 only (Dadoba v. Krishna, ILR 7 
Bom. 34).  
 (v) A company executed, first a deed of trust and mortgage stating that the 
company was to issue notes for raising loans secured by the sale deed. It 
was held as under: 
 
(1) The deed was principal or primary security (and not a collateral 
security). It was chargeable as mortgage under Article 14. 
 
(2) The notes issued subsequently were debentures and not principal 
instruments (Madras Refinery Ltd. v. Chief Controlling Revenue 
Authority, Madras, AIR 1977 SC 500). 
 (vi) The Rangoon Gymkhana executed a duly stamped trust deed, mortgaging 
its assets as security for the repayment of the debenture stock issued by it. 
In addition, it had issued certificates of debenture stock to the subscribers, 
but these did not contain any promise to repay any need, but merely stated 
the amount standing in each stock holder‘s name. It was held that the 
certificates were not debentures, but were instruments employed to 
complete the mortgage [Rangoon Gymkhana In re, AIR 1927 Rang. 37 
(Section 4 applied)]. 
5. SECTION 4 NOT APPLICABLE  
 
(i) A lease is executed and got registered. A second document is executed 
altering the terms of the first document. The second document has to be 
stamped as a lease. Section 4 does not apply. 
 (ii) A purchaser of land executes a mortgage of the land in favour of the vendor 
for a portion of the purchase money. The mortgage is liable to full duty as a 
separate instrument. Section 4 does not apply.  
Instruments relating to several distinct matters 
Under Section 5, an instrument comprising or relating to several distinct matters 
is chargeable with the aggregate amount of the duties with which each separate 
instrument, relating to one of such matters, would be chargeable under the Act 
(This is the reverse of the situation governed by Section 4).  
The Section deals with multifarious instruments. The expression ―distinct 
matter‖ means distinct transactions (Ram Swarup v. Joti, (1933) Allahabad Law 
Journal 427; Board of Revenue, Madras v. Narasimhan, AIR 1961 Mad 504). 
Section 5 applies even where the two (or more) matters are of the same 
description.  
Illustrations as to “distinct matters” 
 
(i) A document containing both an agreement for the dissolution of a 
partnership and a bond, is chargeable with the aggregate of the duties with 
which two such separate instruments would be chargeable. The two are 
 
EP-GCL-5 
271 
―distinct matters‖ (Chinmoyee Basu v. Sankare Prasad Singh, AIR 1955 
Cal. 561 (cf. AIR 1936 Lah. 449). 
 (ii) An agreement containing two covenants making certain properties 
chargeable in the first instance and creating a charge over certain 
properties if the first mentioned properties are found insufficient does 
not fall within Section 5 (Tek Ram v. Maqbul Shah, AIR 1928 Lah. 370). 
 (iii) A grant of annuity by several persons requires only one stamp (because 
there is only one transaction).  
 (iv) A lease to joint tenants requires only one stamp. 
 (v) A conveyance by several persons jointly relating to their separate interest in 
certain shares in an incorporated company requires only one stamp.  
 (vi) A power of attorney executed by several persons authorising the agent to 
do similar acts for them in relation to different subject matter is chargeable 
under Section 5, where they have no common interest.  
 (vii) Where a person having a representative capacity (as a trustee) and a 
personal capacity delegates his powers in both the capacities, section 5 
applies. In law, a person acting as a trustee is a different entity from the 
same person acting in his personal capacity.  
 (viii) The position is the same where a person is an executive or 
administrator and signs an instrument containing a disposition by him 
in his personal capacity and also a disposition as executor. The two 
capacities are different (Member, Board of Revenue v. Archur Paul 
Benthall, AIR 1956 SC 35). 
Principal and ancillary 
The test is – ―What is the leading object? Which is principal and which is 
ancillary?  
If an instrument taken with reference to its primary object is exempted then 
stamp duty cannot be charged merely because matter ancillary to it is included and 
that matter is chargeable to stamp duty. A very common example of this is an 
agreement for sale of goods, which also contains an arbitration clause. The latter 
clause is incidental to the former agreement. Where a deed of dissolution of 
partnership contains a clause charging the partnership assets for payment of 
certain amounts to outgoing parties, the instrument is chargeable separately for the 
charge and the partnership. The former is not ancillary to the latter.  
Where a document contains a transfer of mortgage and an agreement to make 
a loan, the mortgage and the loan are distinct matters and separately chargeable.  
If in a lease there is also an agreement to pay a certain sum on account of the 
balance of previous year, the document is chargeable (I) as a lease and (ii) also as 
a bond.  
A lease reserving separately rent for house and rent for furniture is chargeable 
separately for each of the items.  
Where, at an auction, a purchaser purchases several lots and there is only one 
instrument in respect of all of them the separate purchases are, nevertheless, 
EP-GCL-5 
272 
separate and distinct matters and so, the stamp duty must be determined 
separately.  
Thus, the test usually adopted is the test of ―leading object‖. If there is only one 
leading object, Section 5 will not apply. But if there are several distinct contracts, 
each is taxable.  
6. INSTRUMENTS COMING WITHIN SEVERAL DESCRIPTIONS IN SCHEDULE-I 
There may be cases where an instrument may come under several descriptions 
in Schedule-I to the Act. In such a circumstance, Section 6 of the Act provides that 
the instrument shall, where the duties chargeable thereunder are different, be 
chargeable only with the highest of such duties. Section 6 is subject to the 
provisions of Section 5. However, nothing in the Act shall render chargeable, with 
duty exceeding one rupee, a counter part or duplicate, of any instrument 
chargeable with duty, in respect of which the proper duty has been paid.  
Section 6 applies only where the instrument contains only one matter, but falls 
within two or more items in the Schedule. Section 6 covers cases where the 
instrument does not cover distinct matters but is ambiguous in regard to the various 
entries given in Schedule-I to the Act. In such cases, Section 6 clearly provides that 
the highest of the duties mentioned against the various descriptions against which 
the instrument is likely to fall is to be paid.  
Where a deed (I) contains a stipulation binding the executant to deliver his 
sugarcane crop to the obligee under the deed and (ii) also provides that the 
sugarcane crop is hypothecated as security for payment of money advanced by the 
obligee, the deed fulfills the dual character of the mortgage and a bond and is 
therefore chargeable to the highest of the duties by virtue of section 6. Similarly, 
where an attested instrument, containing an undertaking to pay money, evidences 
also a pledge of immovable property as security for the money due, the higher of 
the stamp duty payable on its character as a bond and on its character as a pledge, 
was held leviable. An instrument which can be treated both as a dissolution of 
partnership and as an instrument of partition has to be charged to the duty 
prescribed for partition deed, which is the higher of the two.  
7. BONDS, DEBENTURES, ETC. ISSUED UNDER THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
LOAN ACT, 1879 
Section 8 provides that any local authority raising a loan under the provisions of 
the Local Authorities Loans Act, 1879 or of any other law for the time being in force 
by the issue of bonds, debentures or other securities, shall, in respect of such 
loans, be chargeable with a duty of one percent on the total amount of the bonds, 
debentures or other securities issued by it. Such bonds, debentures or other 
securities need not be stamped and shall not be chargeable with any further duty 
on renewal, consolidation, sub-division or otherwise. This is so notwithstanding 
anything contained in the Indian Stamp Act: In the event of willful neglect to pay the 
duty required by this section, the local authority shall be liable to forfeit to the 
Government, a sum equal to 10 percent of the amount of duty payable and a like 
penalty for every month after the first, during which the neglect continues.

7A. SECURITIES DEALT IN DEPOSITORY NOT LIABLE TO STAMP DUTY 
As per Section 8A of the Act— 
 (a) an issuer, by the issue of securities to one or more depositories shall, in 
respect of such issue, be chargeable with duty on the total amount of 
security issued by it and such securities need not be stamped; 
 (b) where an issuer issues certificate of security under sub-section (3) of 
Section 14 of the Depositories Act, 1996, on such certificate duty shall be 
payable as is payable on the issue of duplicate certificate under this Act; 
 (c) the transfer of—  
 
(i) registered ownership of securities from a person to a depository or from 
a depository to a beneficial owner; 
 
(ii) beneficial ownership of securities, dealt with by a depository; 
 
(iii) beneficial ownership of units, such units being units of a Mutual Fund 
including units of the Unit Trust of India established under sub-section 
(1) of Section 3 of the Unit Trust of India Act, 1963, dealt with by a 
depository, 
shall not be liable to duty under this Act or any other law for the time being in force. 
Explanation 1 – For the purposes of this section, the expressions ―beneficial 
ownership‖, ―depository‖ and ―issuer‖ shall have the meanings respectively 
assigned to them in clauses (a), (e) and (f) of Sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the 
Depositories Act, 1996. 
Explanation 2 – For the purposes of this section, the expression ―securities‖ 
shall have the meaning assigned to it in clause (h) of Section 2 of the Securities 
Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956. 
7B. CORPORATISATION AND DEMUTUALISATION SCHEMES AND RELATED 
INSTRUMENTS NOT LIABLE TO DUTY 
Section 8B has been inserted by the Finance Act, 2005, w.e.f. 13.5.2005. 
Section 8B sates that  
 (a) a scheme for corporatisation or demutualisation, or both of a recognized 
stock exchange; or

liability and obligation, for the purpose of, or in connection with, the 
corporatisation or demutualisation, or both of a recognized stock exchange 
pursuant to a scheme,  
as approved by the Securities and Exchange Board of India under Sub-section (2) 
of Section 4B of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 shall not be liable 
to duty under this Act or any other law for the time being in force. 
Explanation — For the purposes of this Section
 
 (a) the expressions ―corporatisation‖, ―demutualisation‖ and ―scheme‖ shall

8. REDUCTION, REMISSION AND COMPOUNDING OF DUTIES 
Section 9 empowers the Government, (Central or the State as the case may 
be), to reduce or remit, whether prospectively, or retrospectively, the duties payable 
on any instrument or class of instruments or in favour of particular class of persons 
or members of such class. Section 9 also empowers the Central Government to 
provide for the composition or consolidation of duties of policies of insurance and in 
the case of issues by any incorporated company or other body corporate or of 
transfers where there is single transferee (whether incorporated or not) of 
debentures, bonds or other marketable securities.  
9. VALUATION FOR DUTY UNDER THE ACT 
Sections 20 to 28 (Chapter II of the Act) deal with valuation of instruments for 
duty. 
 (a) According to Section 20, where an instrument is chargeable with ad 
valorem duty in respect of any money expressed in any currency other than 
that of India, such duty shall be calculated on the value of such money in 
the currency of India, according to the current rate of exchange on the date 
of the instrument. The Central Government notifies from time to time, in the 
Official Gazette the rate of exchange for conversion of certain foreign 
currencies into Indian currency for this purpose and such rate shall be 
deemed to be the current rate.  
 (b) Section 21 provides that in the case of an instrument chargeable with ad 
valorem duty in respect of any stock or any marketable or other security, 
such duty shall be calculated on the value of such stock or security 
according to the average price or the value thereof on the date of the 
instrument. The term ―marketable security‖ has been defined in  
Section 2(16-A) of the Act.  
 
 Where the shares are quoted on the stock exchange, it is easy to ascertain 
the price of the shares or stock. However, where the shares or stocks are 
 
EP-GCL-5 
275 
not quoted on any stock exchange, the valuation has to be based upon the 
average of the latest private transactions, which can generally be 
ascertained from the principal officer of the concerned company or 
corporation. If, there have been no dealings at all, then unless some other 
reliable evidence of market value is forthcoming the value is to be taken at 
par. Section 22 of the Act, however, provides that if such price or value is 
mentioned in the instrument for the purpose of calculating duty, it shall be 
presumed (untill the contrary is proved) to be correct.  
 (c) Section 23 provides that where interest is expressly made payable by the 
terms of the instrument, such instrument shall not be chargeable with a 
duty higher than that with which it would have been chargeable, had no 
mention of interest been made therein. For instance, a promissory note for 
Rs. 10,000 is drawn with the recital of interest at the rate of 18 percent per 
annum, payable by the promissor; stamp is leviable on the basis that the 
instrument is for Rs. 10,000 only. 
 (d) Section 23A provides that in the case of an instrument (not being a 
promissory note or bill of exchange) which - 
 
(i) is given upon the occasion of the deposit of any marketable security by 
way of security for money advanced or to be advanced by way of loan, 
or for an existing or future debt, or 
 
(ii) makes redeemable or qualifies a duly stamped transfer, intended as a 
security, of any marketable security. 
 
 It shall be chargeable with duty as if it were an agreement or memorandum 
of an agreement, chargeable with duty under Article 5(c) of Schedule I to 
the Act.  
 (e) A release or discharge of any such instrument shall be chargeable only with 
the like duty.  
 
(f) According to Section 24, where any property is transferred to any person in 
consideration (wholly or in part) of any debt due to him, or subject either 
certainly or contingently to the payment or transfer of any money or stock, 
(whether being or constituting a charge or incumbrance upon the property 
or not), such debt, money or stock is to be deemed the whole or part, (as 
the case may be), of the consideration in respect whereof the transfer is 
chargeable with ad valorem duty. However, nothing in this section shall 
affect such a certificate of sale as is mentioned in Article 18 of the First 
Schedule to the Act.  
The object of this section is that, upon every purchase ad valorem duty has to 
be paid on the entire consideration which either directly or indirectly represents the 
value of the free and unencumbered corpus of the subject matter of the sale 
(Collector of Ahmedabad v. Deepak Textile Industries, AIR 1966 Guj. 227).  
What Section 24 means is that where property is sold subject to the payment 
by the purchaser, discharging a debt charged on the property, then the purchaser is 
really paying a consideration which includes the amount of that debt also (Somayya 
Organics Ltd. v. Board of Revenue, AIR 1986 SC 403). 
EP-GCL-5 
276 
Proviso to Section 24 operates for the benefit of assignee of the mortgage.  
When the mortgaged property is sold to the mortgagee along with other 
properties, the stamp duty already paid is to be deducted from the duty payable on 
the deed of sale. In order to entitle the mortgagee to a deduction of the duties 
payable the entire property mortgaged should be transferred and not merely a 
portion of it (In re Mirabai, in re Laxman and Ganpat, ILR 29 Bom. 203).  
Explanation to Section 24 provides that in the case of sale of property subject 
to mortgage or other encumbrances, any unpaid mortgage money or money 
charged together with the interest, if any, due on the same shall be deemed to be 
part of the consideration for the sale provided that where property subject to a 
mortgage is transferred to the mortgagee he shall be entitled to deduct from the 
duty payable on the transfer the amount of any duty already paid in respect of the 
mortgage. Three illustrations which have been appended to the Section are as 
under: 
 
(i) A owes B Rs. 1,000/-. A sells a property to B, the consideration being Rs. 
500/- and the release of the previous debt of Rs. 1,000/-. Stamp duty is 
payable on Rs. 1,500/- 
 (ii) A sells a property to B for Rs. 500 which is subject to a mortgage to C for 
Rs. 1,000/- and unpaid interest Rs. 200/-. Stamp duty is payable on 1,700. 
 (iii) A mortgages a house of the value of Rs. 10,000/- to B for Rs. 5,000/-. B 
afterwards buys the house from A. Stamp duty is payable on Rs. 10,000/- 
less the amount of stamp duty already paid for the mortgage.  
 (g) Section 25 deals with the manner of computation of duty in the case of 
annuities. Valuation of an annuity will be material, where the payment of 
annuity or other sum payable periodically is secured by an instrument or 
where the consideration for a conveyance is an annuity or other sum 
payable periodically. In such cases, the amount secured by such instrument 
or the consideration for such conveyance, as the case may be, shall be 
deemed to be: 
 
(i) where the sum payable is for a definite period so that the total amount 
to be paid can be previously ascertained such total amount;  
 
(ii) where the sum is payable in perpetuity or for an indefinite time not 
terminable with any life in being at the date of such instrument or 
conveyance – the total amount which, according to the terms of such 
instrument or conveyance will or may be payable during the period of 
twenty years calculated from the date on which the first payment 
becomes due, and 
 
(iii) where the sum is payable for an indefinite time terminable with any life 
in being at the date of such instrument or conveyance – the maximum 
amount which will be or which may be payable as aforesaid during the 
period of 12 years calculated from the date on which the first payment 
becomes due.  
Clause (a) mentioned above applies where the sum is payable for a definite 
period, so that the total amount to be paid can be previously ascertained. According 
 
EP-GCL-5 
277 
to clause (b), where the payment is in perpetuity or for an indefinite period, then 
only the amount payable for 20 years would be taken for assessment of the duty.  
Illustration 
By a document, ‗A‘ binds himself and his posterity on the security of some 
immovable property for the annual payment to a temple of Rs. 2,200/-. It is a 
mortgage deed, chargeable with duty calculated on 20 years‘ payment.  
 (h) Section 26 deals with cases where the value of the subject matter is 
indeterminate. The object of this section is to protect the revenue, in cases 
where an instrument is chargeable with ad valorem duty, but such duty 
cannot be ascertained by reason of the fact that the amount of value of the 
subject matter of the instrument cannot be determined at the time of the 
execution of the instrument. This object is sought to be achieved by 
providing, that the executant can value the instrument as he pleases, but 
he shall not be entitled to recover under such document any amount in 
excess of the amount for which the stamp duty is sufficient.  
However, under the combined operation of Sections 26 and 35, a lessee under 
the mining lease is entitled, upon payment of the proper penalty, to recover the 
royalty provided for in the stamp originally affixed to the lease. [AIR 1924 PC 221; 
AIR 1930 Cal. 526]. Section 26 applies only when the instrument is chargeable with 
ad valorem duty. Section 26 has two provisos. Under the first proviso, in the case of 
mining lease, the stamp duty is to be calculated on the estimated value of the 
royalty or the share of the produce, as the case may be. If the lease is granted by 
the Government, stamp duty has to be paid on the amount or value of the royalty as 
determined by the Collector of Stamps. And, if subsequently any excess is claimed, 
proper penalty under section 35 may be paid and the claim fully recovered. But 
when the lease has been granted by a person other than the Government, the 
valuation has to be at Rs. 20,000/- a year.  
The second proviso to Section 26 is intended to cover the case where an 
instrument has, by accident or mistake, been insufficiently stamped. The deficiency 
is made up in proceedings under Section 31 or 41 and the Collector having certified 
the amount paid, it shall be deemed to be the stamp actually used at the date of 
execution. By reason of this proviso, the amount claimable under the instruments 
would be the amount for which the duty as certified by the Collector had been paid 
and not the amount for which duty was originally paid.  
10. CONSIDERATION TO BE SET OUT 
Section 27 provides that the consideration and all other facts and 
circumstances affecting the chargeability of any instrument with duty or the amount 
of duty with which it is chargeable shall be fully and truly set forth in the instrument. 
―Value of any property‖ would mean that real value of the property in the open 
market at the time the document was executed and not at the time when the 
executant acquired it. Where there is no value set forth in the instruments, there 
would be contravention of Section 27, but the omission does not render the 
document inadmissible or liable to be impounded and taxed in the manner provided 
in Section 35 (Vinayak v. Hasan Ali, AIR 1961 MP 6).

278 
The Collector cannot proceed to ascertain the value of the 
property with a view to causing the instrument to be stamped 
with reference to the value so ascertained by the Collector. The 
Act does not provide for any powers to the revenue authority to 
make an independent enquiry into the value of the property conveyed for 
determining the duty chargeable. (AIR 1922 All 82) 
However, the Collector can direct the prosecution of a person who executed the 
instrument under Section 64 of the Act. Under Section 64, what is punishable is the 
omission to set-forth fully and truly the value of the property, with intent to defraud 
the Government. The Collector, can, if he feels that there is a deliberate under-
valuation of property, hold an independent enquiry to ascertain the true value of the 
property and to consider whether there was deliberate under-valuation rendering 
the executant liable to prosecution for defrauding the Government.1 
11. APPORTIONMENT 
Section 28 prescribes certain rules for apportionment of the consideration, in 
cases of certain conveyances arising out of a property being contracted to be sold 
and thereafter conveyed in parts etc. 
Under Section 28(1) where a person contracts the sale of property as a whole 
and thereafter conveys to the purchaser the property in separate parts, the 
consideration shall be apportioned in such manner as the parties think fit, provided 
that a distinct consideration is set-forth for each separate part in the conveyance 
and thereafter the conveyances shall be chargeable with ad valorem in respect of 
such distinct consideration.  
Under Section 28(2), where the contract is for the sale of a property as a whole 
to two or more purchasers jointly or by any person for himself and others, and the 
property is conveyed to them in parts by separate conveyance, then each distinct 
part of the consideration shall be chargeable with ad valorem duty in respect of the 
distinct part of the consideration so specified.  
Section 28(3) covers cases where a person, after contracting to purchase a 
property from another and before the property has been duly conveyed to him, 
enters into a contract to sell the property to a third person, and the contract is given 
effect to only by one conveyance from the owner of the property to the sub-
purchaser directly. The stamp duty payable is on the consideration paid by the sub-
purchaser. This provision avoids double payment that would otherwise arise.  
Section 28(4) provides that where a person contracts for the sale of property 
and before obtaining a conveyance in his favour, enters into a contract to sell the 
property in parts to other persons, the conveyances which may be executed directly 
by the owner to each sub-purchaser would be liable to be charged with duty in 
respect of the consideration paid by the sub-purchaser, original price for the whole 
and the aggregate price paid by the sub-purchasers, subject to a minimum duty of 
Re. 1/-. 
Section 28(5) provides that when a person contracts to sell a property to 
                                                     
1. In some States, local amendments have given such powers to the collector. 
 
EP-GCL-5 
279 
another person and again contracts to sell the same property to a third person and 
such third person obtains a conveyance first from the seller with whom he had 
contracted and later gets another conveyance of the same property from original 
seller, the duty is to be charged on the consideration received by the original seller 
subject to a maximum of Rs. 5/-. 
12. PERSONS LIABLE TO PAY DUTY 
Section 29 deals with the persons responsible for payment of duty. Under this 
section, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, the expense of providing 
the proper stamp shall be borne: 
 (a) in the case of any instrument described in any of the following articles of 
Schedule-I, namely, - 
 
 
No. 2 
 
(Administration Bond), 
 
 
No. 6 
 
(Agreement relating to Deposit of Title-deeds, Pawn or Pledge), 
 
 
No. 13  
(Bill of Exchange), 
 
 
No. 15  
(Bond), 
 
 
No. 16  
(Bottomry Bond), 
 
 
No. 26  
(Customs Bond), 
 
 
No. 27  
(Debenture), 
 
 
No. 32  
(Further Charge), 
 
 
No. 34  
(Indemnity-bond), 
 
 
No. 40  
(Mortgage-deed), 
 
 
No. 49  
(Promissory-note), 
 
 
No. 55  
(Release), 
 
 
No. 56  
(Respondentia Bond), 
 
 
No. 57  
(Security Bond or Mortgage-deed), 
 
 
No. 58  
(Settlement), 
 
 
No. 62(a) 
(Transfer of shares, in an incorporated company or other body 
corporate), 
 
 
No. 62(b) 
(Transfer of debentures, being marketable securities, whether 
the debenture is liable to duty or not, except debentures 
provided for by Section 8), 
 
 
No. 62(c) 
(Transfer of any interest secured by a bond, mortgage-deed of 
policy of insurance), - 
 
 by the person drawing, making or executing such instrument;  
 (b) in the case of a policy of insurance other than fire insurance by the person 
effecting the insurance; 
 (c) in the case of a policy of fire-insurance – by the person issuing the policy; 
 (d) in the case of a conveyance including a reconveyance of mortgaged 
property by the grantee; in the case of a lease or agreement to lease by the 
lessee or intended lessee; 
EP-GCL-5 
280 
 (e) in the case of a counterpart of a lease – by the lessor; 
 
(f) in the case of an instrument of exchange – by the parties in equal shares; 
 (g) in the case of a certificate of sale – by the purchaser of the property to 
which such certificate relates; and 
 (h) in the case of an instrument of partition – by the parties thereto in 
proportion to their respective shares in the whole property partitioned, or, 
when the partition is made in execution of an order passed by a Revenue 
Authority or Civil Court or arbitrator, in such proportion as such authority, 
Court or arbitrator directs.  
13. RECEIPTS 
Under Section 30 of the Act any person receiving any money exceeding twenty 
rupees in amount or any bill of exchange, cheque or promissory note for an amount 
exceeding five hundred rupees or receiving in satisfaction of a debt any movable 
property exceeding five hundred rupees in value, shall on demand by the person 
paying or delivering such money, bill, cheque, note, or property, give a duly 
stamped receipt for the same.  
14. PARTY LIABLE TO PAY 
Section 29 specifies in the case of certain instruments which party should pay, 
for the stamp. The section is not exhaustive and makes no reference to several 
instruments. Section 30 contains a special provision as to stamping of receipts. 
There are several other instruments not mentioned in Section 29, for which there is 
no express provision as to who should bear the stamp expenses. The primary duty 
of stamping lies in all cases on the person executing the instrument as Section 17 
directs that the instruments chargeable with duty shall be stamped at or before 
executing an instrument without the same being duly stamped. Section 29 would 
apply only in the absence of a special agreement between the parties as stated in 
the opening words of the section. An agreement to bear the cost of preparation of 
an instrument implies an agreement to pay stamp duty also on it.  
Any person receiving or taking credit for any premium or consideration for any 
renewal of any contract of fire-insurance, shall, within one month after receiving or 
taking credit for such premium or consideration, give a duly stamped receipt for the 
same.  
15. METHODS OF STAMPING 
 (a) According to the provisions of the Act and rules made thereunder, the duty 
with which an instrument is chargeable is to be paid by means of stamps 
indicated in the Act and the rules. Generally, rules deal with the subject.  
Section 10 provides that all duties with which any instrument is chargeable shall 
be paid, and such payment shall be indicated on such instrument, by means of 
stamps according to the provisions contained in the Act, or when no such provision 
is applicable thereto, as the State Government concerned may by rule, direct. The 
rules may, among other matters, regulate: 
 
(i) in the case of each kind of instrument, the description of stamps which may 
be used; 
 
EP-GCL-5 
281 
 (ii) in the case of instruments stamped with impressed stamps, the number of 
stamps which may be used; 
 (iii) in the case of bills of exchange or promissory notes, the size of the paper 
on which they are written. 
 (b) There are two types of stamping, namely: 
 
(i) Adhesive stamping, and 
 
(ii) Impressed stamping. 
16. USE OF ADHESIVE STAMPS 
Section 11 deals with the use of adhesive stamps. This Section provides that 
the following instruments may be stamped with adhesive stamps, namely – 
 (a) instruments chargeable with a duty not exceeding 10 naya paisa except 
parts of bills of exchange payable otherwise than on demand and drawn in 
sets; 
 (b) bills of exchange and promissory notes drawn or made out of India; 
 (c) entry as an advocate, vakil or attorney on the roll of a High Court; 
 (d) notarial acts; and 
 (e) transfers by endorsement of shares in any incorporated company or other 
body corporate.  
The use of the words ‗may be stamped‘ really connotes ‗shall be stamped‘. The 
rules framed under the Stamp Act as well as under the relevant state laws 
invariably provide that the adhesive stamps shall carry special words, to indicate 
the use to which the stamps can be put.  
17. CANCELLATION OF ADHESIVE STAMPS 
Section 12(1)(a) provides that any person affixing any adhesive stamp to any 
instrument chargeable with duty which has been executed by another person shall, 
when affixing such stamp cancel the same so that it cannot be used again. Under 
Sub-section (1)(b), an obligation has been imposed on person executing any 
instrument on any paper bearing an adhesive stamp, to cancel the stamp, if such 
cancellation has not been done, at the time of such execution. If a person fails to 
cancel the stamp, he becomes liable to penalty in accordance with Section 63. The 
object is to prevent the same stamp from being used again.  
Under Sub-section (2) of Section 12, any instrument bearing an adhesive stamp 
which has not been cancelled is deemed to be unstamped.  
18. MODE OF CANCELLATION OF ADHESIVE STAMPS 
 (a) Section 12(3) deals with the mode of cancellation of stamp. It provides that 
the cancellation of an adhesive stamp may be done by the person 
concerned by writing on or across the stamp his name or initials, or the 
name or initials of his firm with the true date of his so writing, or in any other 
effectual manner. Sub-section (3) merely lays down as a guidance one of 
the ways in which an adhesive stamp can be cancelled. 
EP-GCL-5 
282 
 (b) In Mahadeo Koeri v. Sheoraj Ram Teli, ILR 41 All 169; AIR 1919 All 196, it 
was held that a stamp may be treated as having been effectively cancelled 
by merely drawing a line across it.  
But, in Hafiz Allah Baksh v. Dost Mohammed, AIR 1935 Lah. 716, it was 
held that if it is possible to use a stamp a second time, in spite of a line being 
drawn across it, there is no effectual cancellation. Again, the question 
whether an adhesive stamp has been cancelled in an effectual manner has to 
be determined with reference to the facts and circumstances of each case.  
In Melaram v. Brij Lal, AIR 1920 Lah. 374, it was held that a very effective 
method of cancellation is the drawing of diagonal lines right across the stamps with 
ends extending on to the paper of the document. A cross marked by an illiterate 
person indicating his acknowledgement, was held to be an effective cancellation of 
the stamp in Kolai Sai v. Balai Hajam, AIR 1925 Rang. 209. Accordingly, where the 
adhesive stamps on promissory note were cancelled by drawing lines on them in 
different directions and stretching beyond the edge of the stamp on the paper on 
which the promissory note was written, it was held that the stamp had been 
effectually cancelled. Where one of the four stamps used on an instrument had a 
single line drawn across the face of the stamp, the second had two parallel lines, 
the third three parallel lines and the fourth two lines crossing each other, it was held 
that the stamps must be regarded as having been cancelled in manner so that they 
could not be used again (In re Tata Iron Steel Company, AIR 1928 Bom. 80). 
Putting two lines crossing each other is effective (AIR 1961 Raj. 43). 
 (c) However, putting a date across the stamp by a third party on a date 
subsequent to the date on which the bill had been drawn, was held to be 
not proper cancellation in Daya Ram v. Chandu Lal, AIR 1925 Bom. 520 Cf. 
Rohini v. Fernandes, AIR 1956 Bom. 421, 423. Similarly, crossing by 
drawing lines and signing on the adjacent stamp was held to be not a 
cancellation of the first stamp in U. Kyaw v. Hari Dutt, AIR 1934 Rang. 364. 
Cross is a good way of cancellation. AIR 1976 Cal. 99. 
 (d) Where it is alleged that the cancellation was made at later stage than that 
of execution, the burden of proving it, lies on the party who so alleges. 
Where an instrument prima facie appears to be duly stamped and cancelled 
by the drawer at the date of execution, the burden of proving the contrary 
lies on the party who avers that the cancellation was not effected at the 
time of execution. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it may be 
inferred that the stamp was duly affixed and cancelled.  
19. INSTRUMENTS STAMPED WITH IMPRESSED STAMPS HOW TO BE 
WRITTEN (WRITING ON STAMP PAPER) 
 (a) Section 13 provides that every instrument written upon paper stamped with 
an impressed stamp shall be written in such manner that the stamp may 
appear on the face of the instrument and cannot be used for or applied to 
any other instrument. The expression, ‗face of the instrument‘ is not to be 
interpreted as meaning that the document must commence on the side on 
which the stamp is impressed or that both sides of the paper or parchment 
may not be written upon. In Dowlat Ram Harji v. Vitho Radhoji, 5 Bom. 188, 
it was held when the face of a deed or document is mentioned, no 
 
EP-GCL-5 
283 
particular side of the parchment or paper, on which the deed or document is 
written, is thereby indicated. Even the last line may constitute the face 
(Westroph, CJ.). 
 (b) Under Section 14, no second instrument chargeable with duty shall be 
written upon piece of stamp paper upon which an instrument chargeable 
with duty has already been written. However, this section shall not prevent 
any endorsement which is duly stamped or is not chargeable with duty, 
being made upon any instrument for the purpose of transferring any right 
created or evidenced thereby, or of getting the receipt of any money or 
goods the payment or delivery of which, is secured thereby. 
 (c) The object of Section 14 is to prevent a stamped paper which has been 
used for one instrument, from being used for another instrument thereby 
avoiding payment of duty in respect of second instrument, AIR 1928 Rang 
262. Except for an endorsement of the kind referred to earlier, no second 
instrument shall be engrossed on a stamp paper on which there is already 
written ‗an instrument chargeable with duty‘. 
An alteration in the instrument as originally written, if it is of such nature, as to 
require fresh stamp, would come within the prohibition contained in the section. It is 
an important question as to what would be a material alteration1 which converts an 
instrument written on stamp paper into a second instrument within the meaning of 
Section 14. A ―material alteration‖ is one which alters (or purports to alter), the 
character of the instrument itself and which affects (or may affect) the contract 
which the instrument contains or alters evidence of any charge, or varies the 
liability under the instrument in any way. An alteration which vitiates the instrument 
as could cause it to operate differently was also held to be a material alteration. An 
alteration which may affect the contract which the instrument contains is a material 
alteration. 
Section 15 of the Act deems every instrument written in contravention of 
Section 13 or Section 14 to be unstamped and to be inadmissible in evidence as 
not being duly stamped. 
20. DENOTING DUTY 
Section 16 of the Act deals with denoting duty. The object of this section is to 
spare parties to an instrument, the inconvenience of having to produce (in cases in 
which the duty payable on an instrument depends upon the duty already paid on 
another instrument), the original or principal instrument in order to prove that the 
second instrument has been duly stamped. Section 16 provides that where the duty 
with which an instrument is chargeable, or its exemption from duty, depends in any 
manner upon the duty actually paid in respect of another instrument, the payment 
of such last mentioned duty, shall, if application is made in writing to the Collector 
for that purpose,  and  on  production  of  both  the instruments, be denoted upon 
such first mentioned instrument,  by  endorsement under the hand of the Collector 
of Stamps or in such other manner as the rules of the State Government may 
provide.

21. TIME OF STAMPING INSTRUMENTS 
 (a) Instruments executed inside India: Section 17 provides that all instruments 
chargeable with duty and executed by any person in India shall be stamped 
before or at the time of execution. The scope of Section 17 is restricted to 
only instruments executed in India. If the executant of a document has 
already completed the execution of the document and in the eye of law the 
document, could be said to have been executed, a subsequent stamping, 
(however close in time) could not render the document as one stamped at 
the time of execution. Thus, where a promissory note is executed by ‗A‘ and 
‗B‘ and a stamp is afterwards affixed and cancelled by ‗A‘ by again signing 
it, the stamping has taken place subsequent to the execution and hence, 
the provisions of Section 17 are not complied with (Rohini v. Fernandes, 
AIR 1956 Bom 421). A receipt stamped subsequent to its execution, but 
before being produced in the Court is not stamped in time and accordingly, 
not admissible in evidence.  
 (b) Instruments executed outside India: Section 18 relates to foreign 
instruments (other than bills and notes), received in India; Foreign bills and 
notes received in India have been dealt with, in Section 19. According to 
Section 18, every instrument chargeable with duty executed only out of 
India and (not being a bill of exchange or promissory note) may be stamped 
within three months after it has been first received in India. Section 18(2) 
provides that where such instrument cannot with reference to the 
description of stamp prescribed therefor, be duly stamped by a private 
person, it may be taken within the said period of three months to the 
Collector who shall stamp the same in such a manner as the State 
Government may by rule prescribe, with a stamp of that value as the 
person so taking such instrument may require and pay for. Where an 
instrument is brought to the Collector after the expiry of three months, the 
Collector may, instead of declining to stamp it, validate it under Sections 41 
and 42 if he is satisfied that the omission to stamp in time was due to a 
reasonable cause. 
The object of Section 18 is to facilitate the stamping of the documents within 
a period of three months, in as much as, by the very nature 
of things, Section 17 relating to instruments executed in 
India cannot be complied with. Section 18 is intended to 
mitigate the inconvenience and hardship that will entail if 
the instrument concerned is required to be stamped before 
or at the time of execution as laid down in Section 17. 
Instrument executed in India is not within Section 18 (Nath 
Bank v. Andhar Mamik Tea Co., AIR 1960 Cal 779).  
As far as bills of exchange and promissory notes are concerned, Section 19 
makes an elaborate provision. Any bill of exchange payable otherwise than on 
demand or promissory note drawn or made out of India must be stamped and the 
stamp cancelled, before the first holder in India deals with the instrument, i.e., 
presents the same for acceptance or payment, or endorses transfers or otherwise 
negotiates the same in India. 
 
EP-GCL-5 
285 
The proviso to Section 19 clarifies that if, (i) at any time any bill of exchange or 
note comes into the hands of any holder thereof in India, (ii) the proper adhesive 
stamp is affixed thereto and cancelled in the manner prescribed by Section 12 and 
(iii) such holder has no reason to believe that such stamp was affixed or cancelled 
otherwise than by the person, and at the time required by the Act, then such stamp 
shall (so far as relates to such holder), be deemed to have been duly affixed and 
cancelled. However, nothing contained in the proviso shall relieve any person from 
any penalty incurred by him, for omitting to affix or cancel a stamp. 
22. ADJUDICATION AS TO STAMPS 
 (a) Chapter III, consisting of Sections 31 and 32, deals with adjudication by the 
Collector, as to the proper stamp that an instrument has to bear. The 
provisions of this Chapter are intended to assist any party who is in doubt 
as to the proper stamp to be affixed on an instrument but is nevertheless 
anxious to stamp the instrument. When the document or any draft of the 
document is produced to the Collector he shall determine the proper stamp 
duty on payment of a nominal fee. The relevant provisions of the Act and 
matters in regard to the performance of this function by the Collector are 
discussed below. 
 (b) Under Section 31(1) when (i) an instrument, (whether executed or not and 
whether previously stamped or not), is brought to the Collector, and (ii) the 
person bringing it applies to have the opinion of that officer as to the duty if 
any, with which it is chargeable, and (iii) pays a fee (not exceeding Rs. 5 
and not less than 50 naya paise as the Collector may direct), the Collector 
shall determine the duty if any with which in his judgment, the instrument is 
chargeable. Under Section 31 (2), the Collector may require to be furnished 
with an abstract of the instrument and also with such affidavit or other 
evidence as he may deem necessary to prove that all the facts and 
circumstances affecting the chargeability of the instrument with duty, or the 
amount of duty with which it is chargeable, are fully and truly set-forth 
therein, and may refuse to proceed upon accordingly. However, no 
evidence furnished pursuant to this section shall be used against any 
person in any civil proceeding, except in an enquiry as to the duty with 
which the instrument to which it relates is chargeable. Every person by 
whom such evidence is furnished shall, on payment of the full duty, be 
relieved from any penalty which he may have incurred under the Act by 
reason of the omission to state truly in such instrument any of the facts or 
circumstances. 
 (c) The duty of the Collector under Section 31 is only to determine the stamp 
duty payable upon the instrument. He is not authorised to impound the 
instrument or to impose any penalty if he comes to the conclusion that the 
instrument is not sufficiently stamped. Where a person has obtained the 
opinion of the Collector on any draft instrument, and thereafter does not 
want to proceed any further to execute the instrument, no consequences 
will follow and, after determination of the duty, the Collector becomes 
functus officio. But where the party wants to proceed with effectuating the 
instrument or using it for the purposes of evidence, he has to pay the duty 
determined by the Collector and obtain from the Collector under Section 32, 
an endorsement that the full duty with which the instrument is chargeable 
EP-GCL-5 
286 
has been paid. Normally, the determination by the Collector of the duty 
payable on an instrument under Section 31 is final. 
 (d) Section 32 deals with certificate by the Collector of Stamps as well as the 
time limit within which such a certificate can be given by the Collector of 
Stamps. Sub-section (1) of the section provides that when an instrument is 
brought to the Collector with an application for having an opinion as to the 
proper duty chargeable thereon, and the Collector is of the opinion that the 
instrument is already fully stamped or the duty determined by the Collector 
under Section 31 or such a sum as (with the duty already paid in respect of 
the instrument), is equal to the duty so determined, has been paid, the 
Collector shall certify by endorsement on such instrument, that the full duty 
(stating the amount) with which it is chargeable has been paid. When the 
Collector is of opinion that any such instrument brought to him is not 
chargeable with duty, he shall certify in the same manner that such 
instrument is not so chargeable. Under Section 32(3), any instrument upon 
which an endorsement has been made by the Collector shall be deemed to 
be duly stamped or not chargeable with duty as the case may be, and if 
chargeable with duty, shall be receivable in evidence or otherwise and may 
be acted upon and registered as if it had been originally duly stamped. 
The proviso to Section 32(3) categorically provides that the Collector shall not 
make any endorsement on any instrument under Section 32, where –  
 (a) any instrument is executed or first executed in India and brought to him 
after the expiration of one month from the date of its execution or first 
execution, as the case may be; 
 (b) any instrument is executed or first executed out of India and brought to him 
after the expiration of three months after it has been first received in India; 
or 
 (c) any instrument chargeable with a duty not exceeding 10 naya paise or any 
bill of exchange or promissory note, is brought to him after the drawing or 
execution thereof, on paper not duly stamped. 
In effect, the proviso to Section 32(3) lays down the time limit within which the 
Collector of Stamps can make any endorsement on any instrument brought to him, 
for his opinion as to the duty chargeable thereon. 
23. INSTRUMENTS 
NOT 
DULY 
STAMPED 
– 
TREATMENT 
AND 
CONSEQUENCES (IMPOUNDING) 
 (a) The definition of the term ―duly stamped‖ has already been explained. 
Chapter IV of the Act (consisting of Sections 35 to 48) provides for the 
consequences that follow where instruments are not duly stamped. 
 
 Section 33 contains a mandate on certain officials to impound an 
instrument which is not duly stamped. Section 33(1) provides that every 
person having by law or consent of parties, authority to receive evidence 
and every person in charge of a public office, except an officer of police 
before whom any instrument, chargeable in his opinion, with duty is 
produced or comes in the performance of his functions, shall, if it appears 
to him that the instrument is not duly stamped, impound the same. The 
object of this Section is to protect the revenue, and the Court or public 
 
EP-GCL-5 
287 
? 
officer authorised by this Section must, exercise the powers under the 
Section suo moto and the jurisdiction of the Court does not depend upon 
raising of an objection by the parties. For the purposes of this section, the 
State Government may determine what offices are public offices. The 
Section also provides that the instrument must be impounded, before it can 
be admitted in evidence. Once it is admitted in evidence, the instrument 
cannot be impounded at a later stage and a court, after it becomes functus 
officio, cannot rectify an earlier error. 
 (b) The word „produced‟ has to be properly understood. It means 
produced in response to a summon or produced voluntarily for some 
judicial purpose, such as, for supporting an evidence. It does not refer 
to a document which accidentally or incidentally falls into a judge‟s 
hand. The Court is not justified in impounding a document which the 
witness had not been called upon to produce (Narayandas v. 
Nathuram, ILR 1943 Nag. 520; AIR 1943 Nag. 97). Similarly, a Court 
before which a copy of a document has been produced cannot compel 
the party to produce the original document with a view to impounding 
it, having received information that is not sufficiently stamped. It is 
open to the party to refuse to obey the order of the Court in this 
respect (Uttam Chand v. Permanand, AIR 1942 Lah. 265). 
 (c) Where a magistrate issued a warrant with a view to discovering registers 
kept by the accused containing documents not stamped in accordance with 
the provisions of the Stamp Act, and in course of the search, the registers 
were seized and produced before the magistrate, it was held that the 
documents thus produced could be impounded as the word ‗comes‘ is 
sufficiently wide to include documents produced by the search under a 
search warrant (Emperor v. Balu Kuppayyan, ILR 25 Mad. 525). This case 
should be confined to its facts.  
 (d) An arbitrator has the consent of parties to adjudicate the issues coming 
before him and where the parties tender evidence, an arbitrator has a 
statutory duty under Section 33(1) to check whether the instrument so 
produced is duly stamped and if not, to impound the same.  
 (e) However, this shall not compel any magistrate or judge of a Criminal Court 
to examine or impound (if he does not think it fit to do so) any instrument 
coming before him in the course of any proceeding other than possession 
proceedings and maintenance proceedings. Also, a judge of a High Court 
can delegate the duty of examining and impounding any instrument to any 
other person appointed by the court in this behalf.

24. UNSTAMPED RECEIPTS 
Section 34 provides that where the instrument is an unstamped receipt 
produced in the course of an audit of any public account, the officer before whom 
the receipt is produced has a discretion either to impound or to require the receipt 
to be stamped. This section applies where the receipt is chargeable with a duty not 
exceeding 10 naya paisa. The officer concerned can, instead of impounding the 
receipt require a duly stamped receipt to be substituted therefor.  
25. INSTRUMENTS NOT DULY STAMPED INADMISSIBLE IN EVIDENCE 
 (a) Section 35 stipulates that no instrument chargeable with duty shall be– 
 
(i) admitted in evidence for any purpose whatsoever by any person 
authorised by law (such as judges or commissioners) or by the consent 
of the parties (such as arbitrators) to record evidence; or  
 
(ii) shall be acted upon; or 
 
(iii) registered; or 
 
(iv) authenticated by any such person as aforesaid or by any public officer. 
 
 unless such instrument is duly stamped.  
 
 An insufficiently stamped instrument is not an invalid document and it can 
be admitted in evidence on payment of penalty.  
 
 [See K. Narasimha Rao v. Sai Vishnu, AIR 2006 AP 80 also at p.302] 
 
 Photocopy of an agreement not being an ‗instrument‘ such copy of 
document which is unstamped can not be validated by payment of stamp 
duty and penalty. Ashok Kalam Capital Builders v. State & Anr., AIR 2010 
(NOC) 736 (Del). 
 (b) The proviso to Section 35 provides as under: 
 
(i) any instrument not being an instrument chargeable with a duty not 
exceeding 10 naya paisa only, or a bill of exchange, or promissory 
note, subject to all such expectations, be admitted in evidence on 
payment of the duty with which the same is chargeable, or, in the case 
of an instrument insufficiently stamped, of the amount required to make 
up such duty, together with a penalty of Rs. 5/- or when ten times the 
amount of the proper duty or deficient portion thereof exceeds Rs. 5/-, 
on a sum equal to ten times such duty or portion; 
 
(ii) where any person from whom a stamped receipt could have been 
demanded has given an unstamped receipt and such receipt, if 
stamped, would be admissible in evidence against him, on payment of 
a penalty of Re. 1/- by the person tendering it;  
 
(iii) where a contract or agreement of any kind is affected by the 
correspondence consisting of two or more letters and any one of the 
letters bears the proper stamp, the contract or agreement shall be 
deemed to be duly stamped;  
 
(iv) nothing contained in Section 35 shall prevent the admission of any 
instrument in evidence in any proceeding in a criminal Court other than 
 
EP-GCL-5 
289 
the proceeding under Chapter XII or Chapter XXXVI of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898;  
 
(v) also nothing contained in Section 35 shall prevent the admission of any 
instrument in the Court, when such instrument has been executed by or 
on behalf of the Government, or where it bears the certificate of the 
Collector as provided by Section 32 or any other provision of the Act.  
 (c) The words ‗shall not be admissible in evidence‘ used in this Section only 
means that the document shall not be made the basis of the decision or 
should not be relied upon to support any finding (Sheonath Prasad v. 
Sorjoo Nonia, 1943 ALJ, 189; AIR 1943 All 220 (FB)). There is no embargo 
upon proving the surrounding circumstances.  
 (d) The words ‗for any purpose‘ used in this Section would have their natural 
meaning. Where an unstamped document is admitted in proof of some 
collateral matter, it is certainly admitted in evidence for that purpose, which 
the Act prohibits. In Ram Ratan v. Parmanand, ILR 1946 Lah. 63, it was 
held that an unstamped partition deed cannot be used to corroborate the 
oral evidence for the purpose of determining even the factum of partition as 
distinct from its term. The words ‗for any purpose‘ would in effect mean ‗for 
each and every purpose whatsoever without any exception‘.  
 (e) It is immaterial whether the purpose is the main purpose or a collateral one. 
The words ‗acted on‘ means that nothing can be recovered under the 
instrument unless it has a proper stamp. Similarly, where a suit is brought 
upon an instrument which is not duly stamped, the admission of the 
contents of the instrument made by the defendant does not avail the 
claimant and a decree cannot be based on such instruments. Admitting an 
instrument in evidence also amounts to acting upon it and an instrument 
which should have been stamped but is not stamped is not admissible in 
evidence for any purpose whatsoever.  
 
(f) Where an unstamped instrument is lost, the party relying on it is helpless 
and no payment of penalty can enable admission of secondary evidence.  
26. ADMISSION OF INSTRUMENTS (WHERE NOT TO BE QUESTIONED) 
Section 36 provides that where an instrument has been 
admitted in evidence, such an admission shall not (except as 
provided in Section 61) be called in question at any stage of the 
same suit or proceeding on the ground that the instrument has 
not been duly stamped. Section 36 is mandatory (Guni Ram v. Kodar, AIR 
1971 All 434, 437). 
If notwithstanding any objection, the trial Court admits the document, the 
matter ends there and the Court cannot subsequently order the deficiency to 
be made and levy penalty (Bhupathi Nath v. Basanta Kumar, AIR 1936 Cal. 
556; AIR 1933 Lah. 240). 
However, it should be mentioned that Section 61 makes certain important 
provisions, details of which will be discussed later.  
EP-GCL-5 
290 
27. ADMISSION OF IMPROPERLY STAMPED INSTRUMENTS 
Under Section 37, opportunity is given to a party, of getting a mistake rectified 
when a stamp of proper amount, but of improper description has been used. Under 
this section, the State Government may make rules providing that, where an 
instrument bears a stamp of sufficient amount but of improper description, the 
instrument may, on payment of the duty with which the stamp is chargeable, be 
certified to be duly stamped, and any instrument so certified shall then be deemed 
to have been duly stamped as from the date of its execution.  
28. DEALING WITH INSTRUMENTS IMPOUNDED 
 (a) Section 38 deals with instruments impounded under Section 33. A person 
impounding an instrument under Section 33 and receiving the same in 
evidence (upon payment of penalty under Section 35 or, of duty under 
Section 37) shall send, to the Collector of Stamps, an authenticated copy of 
such instrument, together with a certificate in writing, stating the amount of 
duty and penalty levied in respect thereof and shall send such amount to 
the Collector or to such person as the Collector may appoint in this behalf. 
In every other case, the person so impounding an instrument shall send it 
in original to the Collector.  
 (b) Section 39 vests the Collector with certain powers to refund penalty 
recovered by a court on impounding a document not duly stamped when 
produced before it. Under Section 38, the court so impounding the 
instrument and realising the penalty has to forward an authenticated copy 
of the instrument and the amount of penalty recovered to the Collector. The 
Collector, on examining the instrument so received by him may, in his 
discretion, refund the whole penalty if it had been imposed for 
contravention of Section 13 or Section 14 of the Act and in any other case 
any portion of the penalty in excess of Rs. 5/- in cases where a copy of the 
instrument under Section 38(1) has been sent to him. The Collector can act 
suo motu without any application in this behalf being made by a party 
affected.  
29. COLLECTOR‟S POWER TO STAMP INSTRUMENT IMPOUNDED 
Section 40 deals with Collector‘s powers to stamp an instrument which is 
impounded. Under Section 40(1), the Collector when impounding any instrument 
under Section 33, or receiving any instrument under Section 38(2) not being an 
instrument chargeable with duty not exceeding 10 naya paisa only or a bill of 
exchange or promissory note, shall adopt the following procedure: 
 
(i) if he is of the opinion that instrument is duly stamped or is not chargeable 
with duty, he shall certify by endorsement thereon that it is duly stamped, or 
that it is not so chargeable as the case may be;  
 (ii) if he is of the opinion that such instrument, is chargeable with duty and is 
not duly stamped, he shall require the payment of the proper duty or the 
amount required to make up the same, together with a penalty of Rs. 5/-, if 
he thinks fit an amount not exceeding ten times the amount of the proper 
duty or of the deficient portion thereof, whether such amount exceeds or 
falls short of Rs. 5/-.  
 
EP-GCL-5 
291 
? 
The Collector, however, has the discretion to remit the whole penalty leviable 
under this Section in a case where the instrument has been impounded only 
because it has been written in contravention of Section 13 or Section 14. 
A certificate given in the situation (i) above, shall, for the purposes of the Act be 
conclusive evidence of the matters stated therein. Sub-section (3) of Section 40 
provides that an instrument which has been sent to the Collector under Section 
38(2) shall be returned to the impounding officer after the collector has dealt with 
the same in the manner provided above.

Who can receive the stamp duty without penalty and certify an instrument as duly 
stamped, as from the date of execution? 
 (a) Revenue Officer 
 (b) Magistrate 
 (c) Collector 
 (d) None of the above 
Correct answer: (c) 
 
30. INSTRUMENTS UNDULY STAMPED BY ACCIDENT 
Section 41 deals with cases where a person, of his own motion bring it to the 
Collector‘s notice that the instrument is not duly stamped. In such cases, if the 
Collector is satisfied, that the omission to pay the proper duty was due to accident, 
mistake or urgent necessity, he may receive the deficit amount and certify by 
endorsement on the instrument that the proper duty has been levied. In order to 
avail of the benefit of this section, the instrument must be produced before the 
Collector within one year of the date of its execution. Where the instrument is 
brought to the notice of the Collector, beyond the period of one year, Section 47 
has no application and the Collector has to proceed under Section 42 read with 
Section 33 and 40 of the Act. Where the instrument having been brought to the 
notice of the Collector within the period of one year, the Collector is in doubt 
regarding the amount of duty chargeable, he may refer the case to the Chief 
Controlling Revenue Authority and proceed in accordance with the decision of such 
authority. However, where no such reference is made by the Collector, the 
Collector‘s decision would be final, and the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority 
cannot interfere with his decision.  
31. ENDORSEMENT OF INSTRUMENT ON WHICH DUTY HAS BEEN PAID 
UNDER SECTIONS 35, 40 AND 41 
Section 42 deals with cases where duty and penalty, if any, have been levied 
and realised by the court or any other body or by the Collector. In such cases, the 
authority refunding and collecting the duty and penalty must make an endorsement 
on the instrument as to the amount paid and the name and the residence of the 
EP-GCL-5 
292 
person paying the same. Upon such certification, the instrument becomes 
admissible in evidence and may be registered and acted upon as if it had been duly 
stamped. The duty and penalty referred to in this Section are those covered by 
Sections 35, 40 or 41 as the case may be. The proviso to this Section lays down 
that no instrument which has been admitted in evidence upon payment of duty and 
a penalty under Section 35, shall be delivered to the person from whom possession 
of it came into the hands of the officer impounding it, before the expiration of one 
month from the date of such impounding or if the Collector has certified that its 
further detention is necessary and has not cancelled such certificate. Again, 
nothing contained in Section 42 shall affect the provisions of clause (3) of Section 
144 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1889 [under the present Code the 
corresponding provision is proviso to Order 13, Rule 9(1)]. 
32. PROSECUTION FOR OFFENCES AGAINST STAMP LAW 
Section 43 deals with prosecutions for offences against the Stamp Law. This 
section provides that a levy of a penalty or payment thereof in respect of an 
unstamped or insufficiently stamped document (as provided for in Chapter IV) does 
not necessarily exempt a person from liability for prosecution for such offence. 
However, the proviso to the section clarifies that no such prosecution shall be 
instituted in the case of any instrument in respect of which a penalty has been paid, 
unless it appears to the Collector that the offence was committed with the intention 
of evading the payment of proper duty. On receipt of copy of the instrument 
impounded under Section 38, the Collector can initiate criminal proceedings if he 
sees reasons therefor.  
33. RECOVERY OF DUTY OR PENALTY IN CERTAIN CASES 
Section 44 deals with the circumstances in which persons paying duty or 
penalty may recover the same in certain cases. The duty or penalty under this 
Section refers to the duty or penalty paid/levied under Sections 35, 37, 40 or 41 of 
the Act. It also includes any duty or penalty under Section 29. The remedy is 
available to a person who, under the Act, was not bound to bear the expense of 
providing the proper stamp for such instrument. Such a person shall be entitled to 
recover, from the person bound to bear such expense, the amount of duty or 
penalty, if any, paid. For the purpose of such recovery, any certificate granted in 
respect of such instruments under the Act shall be conclusive evidence of the 
matters therein certified. Sub-section (3) of Section 44 further provides that the 
amounts so recoverable may, if the court thinks fit, be included in any order as to 
cost in any suit or proceedings to which such persons are parties and in which such 
instrument has been tendered in evidence. If the court does not include the amount 
in such order, no further proceedings for the recovery of the amount shall be 
maintainable.  
34. REFUND OF DUTY OR PENALTY IN CERTAIN CASES BY REVENUE 
AUTHORITY 
Section 45 deals with power of the Revenue Authority to refund the penalty in 
excess of duty payable on instrument in certain cases. Section 39 of the Act 
empowers the Collector to refund a part and in some cases, the whole of the 
penalty paid under the provisions of Section 35. Section 45 further empowers the 
Chief Controlling Revenue Authority to order refunds. The object of granting such 
 
EP-GCL-5 
293 
further power to the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority is evidently to set right 
mistakes or other omissions by the Collector to order refund in deserving cases. 
The Section provides that where any penalty is paid under Section 35 or Section 
40, the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority may, upon application in writing made 
within one year from the date of payment, order, refund such penalty wholly or in 
part. Where in the opinion of the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority, stamp duty in 
excess of that which is legally chargeable has been charged and paid under 
Section 35 or Section 40, such authority may, upon application in writing made 
within three months of the order charging the same, refund the excess.  
It is necessary to appreciate the differences between the powers of the 
Collector under Section 39 and the powers of the Controlling Revenue Authority 
under Section 45 at this stage. They are: 
 
(i) Section 39 provides for refund of penalty, whereas Section 45 confers 
powers to refund even duties where they have been paid in excess.  
 (ii) The Collector‘s power to refund penalty is restricted only to two cases 
mentioned in Section 39(3) but the powers under Section 45 are not subject 
to any such limitation.  
 (iii) Section 39 does not lay down any time limit for the Collector to exercise his 
powers to refund, but in the case of Section 45 there is a time limit.  
 (iv) The power under Section 45 is to be exercised only when an application is 
made by a party, whereas under Section 39 it is routine function of the 
Collector.  
The power under Section 45 is a purely discretionary one and the Chief 
Controlling Revenue Authority cannot be compelled to exercise his power by any 
further proceedings.  
35. NON-LIABILITY FOR LOSS OF INSTRUMENTS SENT UNDER SECTION 38 
Section 46 provides that where any instrument sent to the Collector under 
Section 38(2) is lost, destroyed during transmission, the person sending the same, 
shall not be liable for such loss, destruction or damage.  
However, Section 38(2) provides that when any instrument is to be sent, the 
person from whose possession it came into the hands of the person impounding 
the same may require a copy thereof to be made at his expense and authenticated 
by the person impounding such instruments.  
36. POWER TO STAMP IN CERTAIN CASES 
Under Section 47 when any bill exchange or promissory note chargeable with a 
duty not exceeding 10 naya paise is presented for payment unstamped, the person 
to whom it is so presented may affix thereto the necessary adhesive stamp, and, 
upon cancelling the same in the manner provided in the Act, may pay the sum 
payable upon such bill or note and may charge the duty against the person who 
ought to have paid the same, or deduct it from the sum payable as aforesaid and 
such bill or note shall, so far as respects the duty, be deemed good and valid. 
However, nothing contained in this section shall relieve any person from any 
penalty or proceeding to which he may be liable in relation to such bill or note.  
EP-GCL-5 
294 
37. RECOVERY OF DUTIES AND PENALTIES 
Under Section 48, all duties penalties and other sums required to be paid under 
this Chapter may be recovered by the Collector by distress and sale of the movable 
property of the person or by any other process used for the recovery of the arrears 
of land revenue. This section provides for the mode of realisation of duty or penalty 
or other sums not voluntarily paid.  
38. ALLOWANCE AND REFUND 
Section 49 deals with different circumstances in which refund would be 
admissible in respect of impressed stamps not used. The section applies only to 
impressed stamps and not adhesive stamps. Clause (a) of the section refers to 
cases where the stamp paper is spoiled before any document has been written 
thereon, or is spoiled in the course of writing and before execution. Clause (b) 
refers to cases where the document has been written out wholly or in part but not 
executed. Clause (c) refers to bills of exchange payable otherwise than on demand 
and promissory notes, when these have not been accepted or made use of. Clause 
(d) deals with refunds after execution.  
Section 49 provides that subject to such rule as may be made by the State 
Government, as to the evidence to be required, or the enquiry to be made, the 
Collector may, on application made within the period prescribed in Section 50, and 
if he is satisfied as to the facts, make allowance for impressed stamps spoiled in 
the cases hereinafter mentioned, namely: 
 (a) the stamp on any paper inadvertently and undesignedly spoiled, obliterated 
or by error in writing or any other means rendered unfit for the purpose 
intended before any instrument written thereon is executed by any person;  
 (b) the stamp on any document which is written out wholly or in part; but which 
is not signed or executed by any party thereto; 
 (c) in the case of bills of exchange payable otherwise than on demand or 
promissory notes: 
 
(1) the stamp on any such bill of exchange signed by or on behalf of the 
drawer which has not been accepted or made use of in any manner 
whatever or delivered out of his hands for any purpose other than by 
way of tender for acceptance provided that the paper on which any 
such stamp is impressed, does not bear any signature intended as or 
for the acceptance of any bill of exchange to be afterwards written 
thereon;  
 
(2) the stamp on any promissory note signed by or in behalf of the maker 
which has not been made use of in any manner whatever or delivered 
out of his hands; 
 
(3) the stamp used or intended to be used for any such bill of exchange or 
promissory note signed by, or on behalf of, the drawer thereof, but 
which from any omission or error has been spoiled or rendered useless, 
although the same, being a bill of exchange may have been presented 
for acceptance or accepted or endorsed, or being a promissory note 
may have been delivered to the payee: provided that another 
completed and duly stamped bill of exchange or promissory note is 
 
EP-GCL-5 
295 
produced identical in every particular, except in the correction of such 
omission or error as aforesaid, with the spoiled bill, or note; 
 (d) The stamp used for an instrument executed by any party thereto which–  
 
(1) has been afterwards found to be absolutely void in law from the 
beginning; 
 
(2) has been afterwards found unfit, by reason of any error or mistake 
therein, for purpose originally intended; 
 
(3) by reason of the death of any person by whom it is necessary that it 
should be executed, without having executed the same, or of the 
refusal of any such person to execute the same, cannot be completed 
so as to effect the intended transaction in the form proposed; 
 
(4) for want of the execution thereof by some material party, and his 
inability or refusal to sign the same, is in fact incomplete and insufficient 
for the purpose for which it was intended; 
 
(5) by reason of the refusal of any person to act under the same or to 
advance any money intended to be thereby secured or by the refusal or 
non-acceptance of any office thereby granted, totally fails of the 
intended purpose; 
 
(6) becomes useless in consequence of the transaction intended to be 
thereby effected being effected by some other instrument between the 
same parties and bearing a stamp of not less value; 
 
(7) is deficient in value and the transaction intended to be thereby effected 
has been effected by some other instrument between the same parties 
and bearing a stamp of not less value; 
 
(8) is inadvertently and undesignedly spoiled, and in lieu whereof another 
instrument made between the same parties and for the same purpose 
is executed and duly stamped.  
Provided that, in the case of an executed instrument, no legal proceeding has 
been commenced in which the instrument could or would have been given or 
offered in evidence and that the instrument is given up to be cancelled.  
39. TIME LIMITS 
Section 50 prescribes the time limit within which an application for relief in 
respect of impressed stamps spoiled, can be made; different time limits have been 
specified for the purpose, namely: 
 (1) in the cases mentioned in clause (d)(5) of Section 49, within two months of 
the date of the instrument; 
 (2) in the case of a stamped paper on which no instrument has been executed 
by any of the parties thereto, within six months after the stamp has been 
spoiled; 
 (3) in the case of a stamped paper in which an instrument has been executed 
by any of the parties thereto, within six months after the date of the 
instrument, or if it is not dated, within six months after the execution thereof 
by the person by whom it was first or alone executed: 
EP-GCL-5 
296 
Provided that – 
 (a) when the spoiled instrument has been for sufficient reasons sent out of 
India, the application may be made within six months after it has been 
received back in India.  
 (b) when, from unavoidable circumstances, any instrument for which another 
instrument has been substituted, cannot be given up to be cancelled within 
the aforesaid period, the application may be made within six months after 
the date of execution of the substituted instrument.  
40. UNUSED FORMS 
Section 51 of the Act enables the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority or the 
Collector if authorised by the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority, for such purpose 
to allow refunds in cases where refunds of stamps on printed forms used by 
bankers, incorporated companies/bodies corporate if required. Allowance may be 
made without limit of time, for stamped papers used for printed forms of instruments 
any bankers or by any incorporated company or other body corporate, if for any 
sufficient reasons such forms have ceased to be required by the said banker, 
company or body corporate: provided that the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority 
or the Collector, as the case may be, is satisfied that the duty in respect of such 
stamped papers has been duly paid.  
41. MISUSED STAMPS 
Section 52 deals with allowance for misused stamps and applies to both 
impressed and adhesive stamps in the following instances: 
 (a) When any person has inadvertently used, for an instrument chargeable with 
duty, a stamp of a description other than that prescribed for such 
instrument by the rules made under this Act, or a stamp of greater value 
than was necessary, or has inadvertently used any stamp for an instrument 
not chargeable with any duty; or 
 (b) When any stamp used for an instrument has been inadvertently rendered 
useless under Section 15, owing to such instrument having been written in 
contravention of the provisions of Section 13.  
The Collector may, on application made within six months after the date of 
instrument or, if it is not dated, within six months after the execution thereof by the 
person by whom it was first or alone executed, and upon the instrument, if 
chargeable with duty, being restamped with the proper duty, cancel and allow as 
spoiled the stamp so misused or rendered useless.  
Under Section 53, in any case in which allowance is made for spoiled or 
misused stamps, the Collector may give in lieu thereof: 
 (a) other stamps of the same description and value; or 
 (b) if required and he thinks fit, stamps of any other description to the same 
amount in value; or 
 (c) at his discretion, the same value in money, deducting ten naya paisa for 
each rupee or fraction of a rupee.  
 
EP-GCL-5 
297 
? 
Section 54 of the Act enables a person to obtain refund of the value of stamps 
purchased by him, if he has no immediate use thereof. Under this section, when 
any person is possessed of a stamp or stamps which have not been spoiled or 
rendered unfit or useless for the purpose intended, but for which he has no 
immediate use, the Collector shall repay to such person the value of such stamp or 
stamps in money, deducting ten naya paise for each rupee or portion of a rupee, 
upon such person delivering up the same to be cancelled and proving to the 
Collector‘s satisfaction 
 (a) that such stamp or stamps were purchased by such person with a bona fide 
intention to use them; and 
 (b) that he has paid the full price thereof; and  
 (c) that they were so purchased within the period of six months next preceding 
the date on which they were so delivered.  
Provided that, where the person is a licensed vendor of stamps, the Collector 
may, if he thinks fit, make the repayment of the sum actually paid by the vendor 
without any such deduction as aforesaid.

42. DEBENTURES 
Section 55 is intended to relieve companies renewing debentures issued by 
them from the liability to pay stamp duty on both the original and the renewed 
debenture. As per this section, when any duly stamped debenture is renewed by 
the issue of a new debenture in the same terms, the Collector shall, upon 
application made within one month, repay to the person issuing such debenture, 
the value of the stamp on the original or on the new debenture whichever shall be 
less: 
Provided that the original debenture is produced before the Collector and 
cancelled by him in such manner as the State Government may direct.  
A debenture shall be deemed to be renewed in the same terms within the 
meaning of this section notwithstanding the following changes: 
 (a) the issue of two or more debentures in place of one original debenture, the 
total amount secured being the same; 
 (b) the issue of one debenture in place of two or more original debentures, the 
total amount secured being the same;  
 (c) the substitution of the name of the holder at the time of renewal for the 
name of the original holder; and 
EP-GCL-5 
298 
 (d) the alteration of the rate of interest of the date of payment hereof.  
43. REFERENCE AND REVISION 
Sections 56 to 61 deal with Reference and Revision. Section 56 provides that 
the powers exercisable by a Collector under Chapter IV and V and under clause (a) 
of the first proviso to Section 26 shall in all cases be subject to the control of the 
Chief Controlling Revenue Authority. Further, if any Collector, acting under Sections 
31, 40 or 41, feels doubt as to the amount of duty with which any instrument is 
chargeable, he may draw up a statement of the case, and refer it, with his own 
opinion thereon, for the decision of the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority 
[Section 56(2)].  
Such authority shall consider the case and send a copy of its decision to the 
Collector, who shall proceed to assess and charge the duty (if any) in conformity 
with such decision.  
As per Section 57(1), the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority may state any 
case referred to it under Section 56(2) or otherwise coming to its notice, and refer 
such case, with its own opinion thereon to the High Court and the same shall be 
decided by not less than three Judges of the High Court and the majority decision 
shall prevail.  
According to Section 58, if the High Court is not satisfied that the statements 
contained in the case are sufficient to enable it to determine the questions raised 
thereby, the court may refer the case back to the Revenue Authority for further feed 
back. The High Court shall decide the questions raised and give its judgment to the 
Authority who shall dispose of the case as per the judgment.  
As per Section 60, any subordinate Court can also refer such case to the High 
Court like the Revenue Authority but should be through proper channel. In Section 
61(1) of the Act it is provided that a Court may take into consideration on its own 
motion or on application of the Collector, an order of the lower Court admitting the 
instrument as duly stamped or as not requiring stamp duty or on payment of duty 
and penalty. According to sub-section 2 of Section 61, if such Court is not in 
agreement with the stand of the lower Court, it may require that the instrument be 
produced before it and may even impound the same if necessary. While doing so, 
the Court shall send a copy of its order to the Collector and to the office/Court from 
which such instrument has been received. [Section 61(3)]  
44. PROSECUTION 
As per Section 61(4), the Collector has got the power notwithstanding anything 
contained in the order of the lower court, to prosecute a person if any offence 
against the Stamp Act which he considers that the person has committed in respect 
of such an instrument. The prosecution is instituted when he is satisfied that the 
offence is committed with an intention of evading the proper stamp duty. The order 
of the lower Court as to the instrument shall be valid except for the purposes of 
prosecution in this respect.  
45. CRIMINAL OFFENCES 
Sections 62 to 72 deal with penalties for offences. The provisions are as under: 
 (1) As per Section 62(1), any person  
 
EP-GCL-5 
299 
 
(a) drawing, making, issuing, endorsing or transferring, or signing 
otherwise than as a witness, or presenting for acceptance or payment, 
or accepting, paying or receiving payment of or in any manner 
negotiating, any bill of exchange (payable otherwise than on demand) 
or promissory note without the same being duly stamped; or 
 
(b) executing or signing otherwise than as a witness any other instrument 
chargeable with duty without the same being duly stamped; or

Provided that, when any penalty has been paid in respect of any instrument 
under Sections 35, 40 or 61, the amount of such penalty shall be allowed in 
reduction of the fine (if any) subsequently imposed under this section in respect of 
the same instrument upon the person who paid such penalty. In such a case the 
Collector is to make an enquiry and to give an opportunity to the accused to pay. In 
such cases the instrument is (i) chargeable with duty, and (ii) there is a dishonest 
intention not to pay the duty.  
Sub-section (2) of Section 62, provides that if a share-warrant is issued without 
being duly stamped, the company issuing the same, and also every person who, at 
the time when it is issued, its managing director or secretary or other principal 
officer of the company, shall be punishable with fine which may extend to five 
hundred rupees.  
 (2) Any person required by Section 12 to cancel an adhesive stamp, and failing 
to cancel such stamp in the manner prescribed by that section, shall be 
punishable with fine which may extend to one hundred rupees (Section 63). 
The criminal intention is necessary for an offence under this Section.  
 (3) As per Section 64, any person who, with intent to defraud the Government- 
 
(a) executes any instrument in which all the facts and circumstances 
required by Section 27 to be set forth in such instrument are not fully 
and truly set forth; or  
 
(b) being employed or concerned in or about the preparation of any 
instrument, neglects or omits fully and truly to set forth therein all such 
facts and circumstances; or 
 
(c) does any other Act calculated to deprive the Government of any duty or 
penalty under this Act;  
 
 shall be punishable with fine which may extend to five thousand rupees.  
Here also, an intention to evade payment of proper stamp duty or intention to 
defraud the Government of its stamp revenue is necessary.  
 (4) Any person who (a) being required under Section 30 to give a receipt, 
refuses or neglects to give the same; or (b) with intent to defraud the 
Government of any duty, upon a payment of money or delivery of property 
exceeding twenty rupees in amount or value, gives a receipt for amount or 
value not exceeding twenty rupees, or separates or divides the money or 
property paid or delivered shall be punishable with fine which may extend 
to one hundred rupees (Section 65). To constitute an offence under this 
section, an intention to defraud the Government is necessary.  
EP-GCL-5 
300 
 (5) As per Section 66, any person shall be punishable with fine which may 
extend to Rs. 200/- if he –  
 
(a) receives, or takes credit for any premium or consideration for any 
contract of insurance and does not, within one month after receiving or 
taking credit for, such premium or consideration, make out and execute 
a duly stamped policy of such insurance; or 
 
(b) makes, executes or delivers out any policy which is not duly stamped or 
pays or allows in account, or agees to pay or to allow in account, any 
money upon, or in respect of, any such policy.  
 (6) As per Section 67, if any person drawing or executing a bill of exchange 
(payable otherwise than on demand) or a policy of marine insurance 
purporting to be drawn or executed in a set of two or more, and not at the 
same time drawing or executing on paper duly stamped the whole number 
of bills or policies of which such bill or policy purports the set to consist, 
shall be punishable with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees.  
 (7) Any person who, (a) with intent to defraud the Government, of duty, draws, 
makes or issues any bill of exchange or promissory note bearing a date 
subsequent to that on which such bill or note is actually drawn or made; or 
(b) knowing that such bill or note has been so post-dated, endorses, 
transfers, presents for acceptance or payment, or accepts, pays or receives 
payment of, such bill or note; or in any manner negotiates the same;  
(c) with the like intent, practices or is concerned in any act, contrivance or 
device not specially provided for by this Act or any other law for the time 
being in force; shall be punishable with fine which may extend to one 
thousand rupees. Intention to defraud is an essential ingredient for offence 
under Section 68.  
 (8) If any person appointed to sell stamps who disobeys any rule made under 
Section 74, and any person not so appointed who sells or offers for sale 
any stamp [other than a (ten naya paise or five naya paise) adhesive 
stamp] shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend 
to six months, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with 
both (section 69). Before instituting criminal proceedings under this section 
against any person, sanction of the Collector must be obtained. Otherwise, 
the proceedings will be vitiated. A criminal court having jurisdiction to try 
offences under Cr. P.C. can try such offences.  
46. TAKING COGNIZANCE 
 (a) No prosecution in respect of any offence punishable under this Act or any 
Act hereby repealed, shall be instituted without the sanction of the Collector 
or such other officer as the State Government generally or the Collector 
specially, authorises in that behalf.  
 (b) The Chief Controlling Revenue Authority, or any officer generally or 
specially authorised by it in this behalf, may stay any such prosecution or 
compound any such offence.  
 (c) The amount of any such composition shall be recoverable in the manner 
provided by Section 48.  
 
EP-GCL-5 
301 
A Magistrate other than a Presidency Magistrate or a Magistrate whose powers 
are not less than those of a Magistrate of the second class, shall try any offence 
under this Act (Section 71).  
Every such offence committed in respect of any instrument may be tried in any 
district or presidency town in which instrument is found as well as in any district or 
presidency town in which such offence might be tried under the Code of Criminal 
Procedure for the time being in force (Section 72).  
47. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 
Chapter VIII, containing Sections 73 to 78 deals with supplemental provisions 
regarding inspection of relevant registers, books, records, etc; to enter the 
premises for that purpose, powers of Government to frame rules for the sale and 
supply of stamps and to make rules generally to carry out the provisions of the Act.  
Section 77A provides that all stamps in denominations of annas four or multiples 
thereof shall be deemed to be stamps of the value of 25 naya paise or (as the case 
may be), multiples thereof and shall accordingly be valid for all the purposes of the 
Act. From this it can be inferred that whatever the stamp duty is mentioned to be 
annas in the first Schedule; the instrument concerned has to be treated as leviable 
with duty of 25 naye paise or in multiples thereof as the case may be.  
48. SCHEDULE 
The Schedule to the Stamp Act prescribes the rates of stamp duties on 
instruments. Articles 13, 27, 37, 47, 49, 53 and 62(a) of the Schedule relate to 
instruments, the rates of duties on which are prescribed by the Central Legislature 
and have been subject to legislative amendments by that Legislature (See Entry 91 
of List I). The other articles relate to instruments in respect of which the Central 
Legislature has lost its power to regulate rates of duties (except for Union 
Territories) since the passing of the Government of India Act, 1935. With respect to 
these instruments, the rates mentioned are fixed by the State Legislatures (See 
Entry 63 of List II). 
 
LESSON ROUND-UP 
 
 
The Indian Stamp Act, 1899 is the law relating to stamps which consolidates and 
amends the law relating to stamp duty. It is a fiscal legislation envisaging levy of 
stamp duty on certain instruments. 
 
Entry 91 of the Union List, gives power to Union Legislature to levy stamp duty 
with regard to certain instruments (mostly of a commercial character). They are 
bill of exchange, cheques, promissory notes, bill of lading, letters of credit, 
policies of insurance, transfer of shares, debentures, proxies and receipt. 
Likewise, entry 63 of the State List confers on the States power to prescribe the 
rates of stamp duties on other instruments. 
EP-GCL-5 
302 
 
Instrument includes every document by which any right or liability, is, or purported 
to be created, transferred, limited, extended, extinguished or recorded. Any 
instrument mentioned in Schedule I to Indian Stamp Act is chargeable to duty as 
prescribed in the schedule. 
 
In case of sale, mortgage or settlement, if there are several instruments for one 
transaction, stamp duty is payable only on one instrument. On other instruments, 
nominal stamp duty of Re. 1 is payable. If one instrument relates to several 
distinct matters, stamp duty payable is aggregate amount of stamp duties 
payable on separate instruments. 
 
Government can reduce or remit whole or part of duties payable. Such reduction 
or remission can be in respect of whole or part of territories and also can be for 
particular class of persons. Government can also compound or consolidate duties 
in case of issue of shares or debentures by companies. 
 
The payment of stamp duty can be made by adhesive stamps or impressed 
stamps. Instrument executed in India must be stamped before or at the time of 
execution. Instrument executed out of India can be stamped within three months 
after it is first received in India. In some cases, stamp duty is payable on ad 
valorem basis, i.e. on the basis of value of property, etc. In such cases, value is 
decided on prescribed basis. 
 
An instrument not ‗duly stamped‘ cannot be accepted as evidence by civil court, 
an arbitrator or any other authority authorized to receive evidence. However, the 
document can be accepted as evidence in criminal court. Duly stamped means 
that the instrument bears an adhesive or impressed stamp not less than proper 
amount and that such stamp has been affixed or used in accordance with law in 
force in India. 
 
If non-payment or short payment of stamp duty is by accident, mistake or urgent 
necessity, the person can himself produce the document to Collector within one 
year. In such case, Collector may receive the amount and endorse the document 
that proper duty has been paid. 
 
If the company issues securities to one or more depositories, it will have to pay 
stamp duty on total amount of security issued by it and such securities need not be 
stamped. If an investor opts out of depository scheme, the securities surrendered to 
Depository will be issued to him in form of a certificate. Such share certificate 
should be stamped as if a ‗duplicate certificate‘ has been issued. If securities are 
purchased or sold under depository scheme, no stamp duty is payable. 
 
A levy of a penalty or payment in respect of an unstamped or insufficiently 
stamped document does not necessarily exempt a person from liability for 
prosecution for such offence. Revenue Authority has been authorized to refund 
the penalty in excess of duty payable on instrument in certain cases. 
 
The Collector has got the power notwithstanding anything contained in the order 
of the lower court, to prosecute a person if any offence against the Stamp Act 
which he considers that the person has committed in respect of such an 
instrument. The prosecution is instituted when he is satisfied that the offence is 
committed with an intention of evading the proper stamp duty. The order of the 
lower court as to the instrument shall be valid except for the purposes of 
prosecution in this respect. 
 
Provisions have been incorporated to relieve companies renewing debentures 
issued by them from the liability to pay stamp duty on both the original and the 
renewed debenture.

STUDY VI 
LAW RELATING TO REGISTRATION OF DOCUMENTS 
  
 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Registration means recording of the contents of a document with a Registering Officer 
and preservation of copies of the original document. The Registration Act, 1908 is the 
law relating to registration of documents. The object and purpose of the Act among 
other things is to give information to people regarding legal rights and obligations 
arising or affecting a particular property, and to perpetuate documents which may 
afterwards be of legal importance, and also to prevent fraud. It is important for the 
students to be thoroughly acclimatized with this branch of law to know its practical 
significance. 
At the end of the Study Lesson you should be able to understand: 
 
Documents whose registration is compulsory 
 
Documents of which registration is optional 
 
Time-limit for presentation 
 
Re-registration of documents 
 
Documents executed out of India 
 
Presentation of a will for registration 
 
Presenting of documents for registration 
 
Registered document when operative 
 
Effect of non-registration of documents 
 
Certificate of registration 
 
Procedure after registration 
 
Appeal to registrar 
 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
Registration of a document inter alia, ensures its proper preservation and 
record. The Registration Act, 1908 is the law relating to registration  of documents. 
Registration is of a document and not of a transaction.  
304 
 
EP-GCL-6 
305 
2.  REGISTRABLE DOCUMENTS 
Documents can be classified into two classes: 
 
(i) Those whose registration is compulsory; (Section 17) 
 (ii) Those whose registration is optional. (Section 18) 
3.  DOCUMENTS WHOSE REGISTRATION IS COMPULSORY 
According to Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908, documents whose 
registration is compulsory are the following: 
 (a) Instruments of gift of immovable property 
 
 In a case where the donor dies before registration, the document may be 
presented for registration after his death and if registered it will have the 
same effect as registration in his life time. On registration the deed of gift 
operates as from the date of execution. 
 
 It was held by the Privy Council in Kalyana Sundram v. Karuppa, AIR 
1927 PC 42, that while registration is a necessary solemnity for the 
enforcement of a gift of immovable property, it does 
not suspend the gift until registration actually takes 
place, when the instrument of gift has been handed 
over by the donor to the donee and accepted by him, 
the former has done everything in his power to 
complete the donation and to make it effective. And 
if it is presented by a person having necessary 
interest within the prescribed period the Registrar 
must register it. Neither death nor the express revocation by the 
donor, is a ground for refusing registration, provided other conditions 
are complied with. (Cf. Mulla Registration Act (1998), page 36) 
 (b) Other non-testamentary instruments (other than instruments of gift of 
immovable property) which purport or operate to create, declare, assign, 
limit or extinguish, whether in present or in future, any right, title of interest 
whether vested or contingent, of the value of one hundred rupees and 
upwards, to or in immovable property situated in a district in which this Act 
is in force.  
A document which is plainly intended to be operative immediately is non-
testamentary (Umrao Singh v. Lachhman, (1911) 1 LR 33 All 344, 355 (PC); Mulla, 
Registration Act (1998), page 40).  
Description of a document as a will does not make it a will (Tirugnannpal v. 
Poonamma, AIR 1921 PC 89).  
The expressions ―create‖, ―assign‖, ―limit‖ or ―extinguish‖ imply a definite 
change of legal relation to a property by an expression of will embodied in the 
document. It implies a declaration of will.  
The expression ―declare‖ (as used in Section 17) has also to be interpreted on 
the same lines. It does not mean a mere declaration of fact, but connotes a writing 
effectuating a change of relation (Bageshwari Charan v. Jagarnath Kuare, AIR 
1932 PC 55; Mulla, Registration Act (1998), page 41).  
EP-GCL-6 
306 
Whether an instrument requires registration under Section 17(1)(b) depends 
upon whether it operates or purports to bring about a change in legal relation in 
respect of some property. For purposes of Section 17(1)(b) a distinction should be 
drawn between (i) a right in or to property and (ii) such rights as are merely 
incidental to the ownership of property and are really in the nature of powers or 
options which every owner is free to exercise in dealing with his property in a 
particular way. The latter may be described as rights in relation to the property, but 
strictly speaking, they are not rights in or to property. Generally, when a right in or 
to property is assigned, created, declared, limited or extinguished, then there must 
be a definite change of legal relation to the property.  
 (c) Non-testamentary instruments which acknowledge the receipt or payment 
of any consideration on account of the creation, declaration, assignment, 
limitation, or extinction of any such right, title or interest. 
 
 This clause requires an acknowledgement in the form of a receipt to be 
registered, but not an acknowledgement of the fact that a transaction has 
taken place. To be registrable under this clause a receipt must satisfy the 
following two conditions: 
 
(i) it must be the receipt of a consideration; and 
 
(ii) it must on the face of it be an acknowledgement of payment or some 
consideration on account of the creation, declaration, assignment, 
limitation or extinction of an interest of the value of Rs. 100 or upwards 
in immovable property.  
The receipt must be such as to be linked with the creation etc. of a right. A 
mere acknowledgement of payment is not compulsorily registrable. 
Illustration 
In a suit by A against B for lands, B pleads adverse possession. B in defence, 
proves B’s acknowledgement (in a petition to the Collector) that the gift is in her 
favour. The petition is not admissible and does not require registration (Mulla, 
Registration Act (1998), page 69; Bageshwari v. Jagarnath Kuare, AIR 1932 PC 55). 
Delay in registration of a gift does not postpone its 
operation. Section 123, Transfer of Property Act, 1882 
merely requires that donor should have signed the deed of 
gift. Hence a gift deed can be registered even if the donor 
does not agree to its registration (Kalyan Sundaram Pillai 
v. Karuppa Mopanar, AIR 1927 PC 42; Venkata Rama Reddy 
v. Pillai Rama Reddy, AIR 1923 Mad. 282). 
A lease for one year containing an option to the tenant to renew for a further 
period of one year or any other term is not a lease for a term exceeding one year, 
and does not require registration under this clause. Under Section 
107 of the Transfer of Property Act, a lease of one year or reserving 
a yearly rent can be made only by a registered instrument. But 
where the lease is only for one year with a reserved rent for the 
period for which it has been granted, viz. one year, it does not require registration.  
 
EP-GCL-6 
307 
Cases under Section 107 of Transfer of Property Act, and Section 17(1)(d) of 
Registration Act. 
A comparison of both these Sections would show that a lease of immovable 
property is compulsory registrable: 
 (a) if it is from year to year; or 
 (b) if it is for a term exceeding one year; or 
 (c) if it reserves a yearly rent.  
 
 If a lease is of a very high value but is neither from year to year, nor for any 
term exceeding one year, nor reserving a yearly rent, it does not require 
registration under Section 17(1)(d).  
 (d) Non-testamentary instruments transferring or assigning any decree or 
order of a Court or any award in order to create interests as mentioned in 
Clause (b). 
 
 A transfer of a decree or order of a court or of any award when such decree 
or order or award operates to create, declare, etc. any interest of the value 
of Rs. 100 and upwards in immovable property, requires registration.  
 
 However, the State Government is empowered to exempt any leases 
executed which do not exceed five years and the annual rents reserved 
which do not exceed 50 rupees, from the operation of this Sub-section. 
 (e) It may be pointed out that the documents containing contracts to transfer 
for consideration, any immovable property for the purpose of Section 53A 
of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 shall be registered if they have been 
executed on or after the commencement of the Registration and other 
Related Laws (Amendment) Act, 2001 and if such documents are not 
registered on or after such commencement, then they shall have no effect 
for the purposes of the said Section 53A. 
Exceptions to Section 17(1) 
The registration of the non-testamentary documents mentioned in clauses (b) 
and (c) of Section 17(1) is subject to the exceptions provided in Sub-section (2) of 
Section 17. These are as follows: 
 
(i) any composition deed, i.e., every deed the essence of which is 
composition; or 
 (ii) any instrument relating to shares in Joint Stock Company; or 
 (iii) any debentures issued by any such Company; or 
 (iv) any endorsement upon or transfer of any debenture; or 
 (v) any document other than the documents specified under clause (e) above 
creating merely a right to obtain another document which will, when 
executed create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish any such right, title or 
interest; or 
 (vi) any decree or order of a court; or 
 (vii) any grant of immovable property by the Government; or 
 (viii) any instrument of partition made by Revenue-officer; or 
EP-GCL-6 
308 
? 
 (ix) any order granting a loan or instrument of collateral security granted under 
the Land Improvement Act, 1871, or the Land Improvement Loans Act, 
1883; or 
 (x) any order granting loan made under the Agriculturists Loans Act, 1884 or 
instrument for securing the repayment of a loan made under that Act; or 
 (xi) any order made under the Charitable Endowments Act, 1890 vesting any 
property in a treasurer of a charitable endowment or divesting any such 
Treasurer of any property; or 
 (xii) any endorsement on a mortgage deed acknowledging the payment of the 
whole or any part of the mortgage money, and any other receipt for 
payment of money, due under a mortgage when the receipt does not 
purport to extinguish the mortgage; or  
 (xiii) any certificate of sale granted to the purchaser of any property sold by 
public auction by Civil or Revenue Officer. 
Explanation 
A document purporting or operating to effect a contract for the sale of 
immovable property shall not be deemed to require for ever to have required 
registration by reason only of the fact that such document contains a recital of 
payment of any earnest money or of the whole or any part of the purchase money.  
 
Test your knowledge 
State whether the following statement is “True” or “False” 
A mere acknowledgement of payment is always registrable. 
 
True 
 
False 
Correct Answer: False 
  
4.  DOCUMENTS OF WHICH REGISTRATION IS OPTIONAL 
Whereas Section 17 of the Act has made registration of certain documents 
compulsory, Section 18 specifies documents, registration of which is optional. It 
provides that any of the following documents may be registered under this Act, 
namely: 
 (a) instruments (other than instruments of gift and wills) which purport or 
operate to create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish, whether in present or 
in future, any right, title or interest whether vested or contingent, of value 
less than one hundred rupees, to or in immovable property; 
 (b) instruments acknowledging the receipt or payment of any consideration on 
account of the creation, declaration, assignment; limitation or extinction of 
any such right, title or interest;  
 (c) leases of immovable property for any term not exceeding one year and 
leases exempted under Section 17; 
 
EP-GCL-6 
309 
? 
 (d) instruments transferring or assigning any decree or order of a court or any 
award when such decree or order or award purports or operates to create, 
declare, assign, limit or extinguish, whether in present or in future, any 
right, title or interest, whether vested or contingent of a value less than one 
hundred rupees, to or in immovable property; 
 (e) instruments (other than wills) which purport or operate to create declare, 
assign, limit or extinguish any right, title or interest to or in movable 
property;  
 
(f) wills; and 
 (g) other documents not required by Section 17 to be registered. (Section 18) 
5.  TIME LIMIT FOR PRESENTATION 
A document other than a will must be presented within 
four months of its execution. In cases of urgent necessity, 
etc. the period is eight months, but higher fee has to be 
paid (Sections 23-26). These limits are mandatory (Ram 
Singh v. Jasmer Singh, AIR 1963 Punj. 100). If delay is due 
to act of Court, it has to be disregarded (Raj Kumar v. 
Tarapa, AIR 1987 SC 2195).  
Section 23, proviso prescribes a period of four months for presenting a copy of 
a decree or order. It is counted from the date of the decree.  
Unstamped document 
If the document is not sufficiently stamped its presentation is still good 
presentation though penalty under the Stamp Act can be levied (Mahaliram v. 
Upendra Nath, AIR 1960 Pat 470). 
  
Test your knowledge 
State whether the following statement is “True” or “False” 
According to Section 17, registration of instruments of gift of immovable property is 
compulsory. 
 
True 
 
False 
Correct Answer: True 
 
6.  RE-REGISTRATION 
Section 23A provides for the re-registration of certain documents. The section 
is mainly intended to deal with situations where the original presentation was by a 
person not duly authorised. It overrides the decision in Jambu Prasad v. 
Mohammed Aftab Ali Khan, (1914) ILR 37 All 49). 
EP-GCL-6 
310 
7.  SEVERAL EXECUTANTS 
Under Section 24 a document executed by several persons at different times 
may be presented for registration and re-registration within four months from the 
date of each execution.  
The registration is ―partial‖ in regard to each party. (Mulla, Registration Act 
(1998), page 163) 
8.  DOCUMENTS EXECUTED OUT OF INDIA 
As per Section 26 Where the registering officer is satisfied that the document 
was executed outside India and it has been presented for registration within four 
months after its arrival in India, he may accept such document for registration on 
payment of proper registration fee. A document executed outside India is not 
valid unless it is registered in India (Nainsukhdas v. Gowardhandas, AIR 1948 
Nag. 110).  
Incidentally, Section 26 indicates that the Act applies to ex-India documents 
relating to property in India. (Mulla, page 166) 
8A.  PRESENTATION OF A WILL 
Section 27  provides that a will may be presented for registration at any time or 
deposited in a manner provided in Sections 40-46. Registration of a will is optional 
under Section 18(e).  
9.  PLACE OF REGISTRATION 
Section 28 provides that documents affecting immovable property mentioned in 
Sections 17(1) and (2) and Sections 17(1)(a)(b)(c) and (cc)(d) and (e),  
Section 17(2), etc. shall be presented for registration in the office of a Sub-
Registrar within whose sub-district the whole or some portion of the relevant 
property is situated and any other document may be presented for registration 
either in the office of the Sub-Registrar in whose sub-district the document was 
executed or in the office of any other Sub-Registrar under the State Government at 
which all the persons executing desire the document to be registered. (All these 
documents relate to immovable property). Registration of a document elsewhere 
has been held to be void (Harendra Lal Roy Chowdhuri v. Hari Dasi Debi, (1914) 
ILR 41 Cal. 972, 988 (PC); Mulla, Registration Act (1998), page 167 and cases in 
footnote 2).  
There is nothing in law to prohibit a person conveying property in one district 
and residing and owing property in another district and asking the vendee to accept 
a conveyance also of some small property in the district in which he resides, so that 
the sale-deed may be registered there and he may not be put to the trouble and 
expense of a journey to the other district. It is not correct to say in such a case that 
the sale-deed is not validly registered at the place where it is got registered.  
However, there should be no fraud or collusion. Smallness of the area does not 
necessarily lead to inference of fraud. (Mulla Registration Act (1998), pages 169-
171. See in particular the cases cited in Mulla page 170, footnotes 15-19).  
10.  COPY OF A DECREE OR ORDER 
A copy of a decree or order may be registered with the Sub-Registrar within 
whose sub-district it was made. If the decree or order does not affect immovable 
 
EP-GCL-6 
311 
property, it may be presented for registration in the office of any other Sub-
Registrar under the State Government at whose office all persons claiming under 
the decree or order desire it to be registered.  
10A.  REGISTRATION IN CERTAIN CITIES 
In any city comprising a Presidency town or in Delhi, a document relating to 
property situated any where in India may be registered (Section 30). Delhi was 
added by Amendment Act 45 of 1969.  
Under Section 31, registration is permitted in cases of necessity under extra-
ordinary circumstances, at the residence of the executant.  
11.  PRESENTING OF DOCUMENTS FOR REGISTRATION 
Section 32 specifies the persons who can present documents for registration at 
the proper registration office. Such persons are as follows: 
 (a) some person executing or claiming under the same, or in the case of a 
copy of a decree or order, claiming under the decree or order, or 
 (b) the representative or assign of such person, or 
 (c) the agent of such person, representative or assign, duly authorised by 
power-of-attorney executed and authenticated in the manner hereinafter 
mentioned.  
It is immaterial whether the registration is compulsory or optional; but, if 
it is presented for registration by a person other than a party not mentioned 
in Section 32, such presentation is wholly inoperative and the registration of 
such a document is void (Kishore Chandra Singh v. Ganesh Prashad Singh, 
AIR 1954 SC 316). However, Sections 31, 88 and 89 provide exceptions to this 
requirement.  
For the purpose of Section 32, a special power of attorney is required as 
provided under Section 33. A general power of attorney will not do. Section 33 
requires that a power of attorney, in order to be recognised as giving authority to 
the agent to get the document registered, should be executed before and then 
authenticated by the Registrar within whose district or sub-district the principal 
resides. (Sections 32 to 35) 
12. ENQUIRY BEFORE REGISTRATION BY REGISTERING OFFICER 
For registering a document the persons executing such document or their 
representatives, assigns or authorised agents must appear before the registering 
officer within the time allowed for presentation. (Section 34) 
In Section 34, the expression ―person executing‖ not only includes the agent 
who has signed (with authority), but also the principal who is a party (Puran Chand 
v. Manmotho Nath, AIR 1928 PC 38).  
It is the compliance with the provisions of Sections 34, 35, 58 and 59 of the Act, 
which really constitutes registration and not the presence of the certificate. Hence, 
subsequent acts of the Registrar which are ministerial acts, cannot affect the 
validity of the registration and the absence of final certificate of registration under 
section 60 cannot affect its validity.

State whether the following statement is “True” or “False” 
A document executed outside India can be valid even if it is not registered in India. 
 
True

Correct Answer: False 
 
13.  PRESENTING WILLS AND AUTHORITIES TO ADOPT 
 (a) Who is entitled to present Wills and authorises to adopt 
 
 The testator, or after his death, any person claiming as executor or 
otherwise under a will, may present it to any Registrar or Sub-Registrar for 
registration. In case of authority for adoption, the donor or (after his death) 
the donee, or any authority to adopt, or the adoptive son, may present it to 
any Registrar or Sub-Registrar for registration. (Section 40) Thus, even a 
legatee can present a will (Venkatapayya v. Venkata Ranga, AIR 1929 PC 
24).  
 (b) Registration of will and authority to adopt 
 
(i) A will, or an authority to adopt, if presented by the testator or the donor, 
may be registered in the same manner as any other document. 
[Section 41(1)] 
 
(ii) If presented by any other person entitled to present it, it shall be 
registered if the registering officer is satisfied about the particulars 
mentioned in Section 41(2).  
13A.  DEPOSIT OF WILLS 
Any testator may, either personally or by duly authorised agent, deposit with 
any Registrar his will in a sealed cover superscribed with the name of the testator 
and that of his agent, if any, and with a statement of the nature of the document.  
On receiving such documents, the Registrar on being satisfied shall transcribe 
in his Registrar Book No. 5, the superscription and shall note the date, time, month, 
etc. of such receipt and shall then place and retain the sealed cover in his fire-proof 
box.  
However, the testator may withdraw it by applying for the same and the 
Registrar shall deliver it accordingly (Sections 42 to 46). 
14.  REGISTERED DOCUMENT WHEN OPERATIVE 
 
(a) A registered document shall operate from the time from 
which it would have commenced to operate if no registration thereof 
had been required or made and not from the time of its registration. 
(Section 47) 
 
EP-GCL-6 
313 
 (b) As between two registered documents, the date of execution 
determines the priority. Of the two registered documents, executed by 
same persons in respect of the same property to two different persons 
at two different times, the one which is executed first gets priority 
over the other, although the former deed is registered subsequently to 
the later one (K.J. Nathan v. S.V. Maruthi Rai, AIR 1965 SC 430; Mulla 
page 207).  
In effect1 Section 47 means that a document operates from the date of execution 
(as between the parties). (Mulla, Registration Act (1998), pages 207, 209) 
15. REGISTERED DOCUMENT RELATING TO PRIORITY WHEN TO TAKE 
EFFECT AGAINST ORAL AGREEMENT 
Generally, priority to rights accorded by different transfers is governed by the 
principles embodied in the maxim qui prior tempore potior est jure that is ―he who is 
first in time is better in law‖. But this general rule is subject to exceptions created by 
Sections 48 and 50. Section 48 refers to the priority of the registered agreements 
over oral agreements and Section 50 refers to the priority of registered agreements 
over non-registered agreements. (Section 48) 
Notice 
In spite of the explicit wording of Section 48, it has for long time been held, that 
a subsequent registered deed will not prevail over a prior unregistered deed or a 
prior oral transaction if the subsequent transferee had notice of the prior 
transaction. (Mulla Registration Act (1998), pages 215-216) 
16. 
EFFECT OF NON-REGISTRATION OF DOCUMENTS 
REQUIRED TO BE REGISTERED 
Section 49 of the Act provides that no document required by 
Section 17 or by any provision of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 to be 
registered shall: 
 (a) affect any immovable property comprised therein; or 
 (b) confer any power to adopt; or 
 (c) be received as evidence of any transaction affecting such property or 
conferring such power unless it has been registered. 
Section 49 is mandatory, and a document which is required to be registered 
cannot be received in evidence as affecting immovable property. (Mulla, pages 223 
to 228) 
An unregistered document which comes within Section 17 cannot be used in 
any legal proceeding to bring out indirectly the effect which it would have if 
registered.  
However, as provided in Section 49, proviso, an unregistered document 
                                                          
1. Section 47 does not affect rules of personal law requiring possession. [Mulla (1998), page 209]. 
EP-GCL-6 
314 
affecting immovable property and required by this Act or the Transfer of property 
Act, 1882 to be registered may be received as evidence of a contract in a suit for 
specific performance or as evidence of part performance of a contract for the 
purposes of Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 or as evidence of 
any collateral transaction not to be effective by registered instrument. All that the 
proviso to Section 49 permits is that in a suit for specific performance an 
unregistered document affecting immovable property may be given in evidence. 
The purpose is that the document which has not conveyed or passed title may still 
be used as evidence of the terms. In K. Narasimha Rao v. Sai Vishnu, AIR 2006 
NOC (A.P.) p. 80, it has been held that: 
It is settled legal principle that an unstamped instrument is not at all 
admissible in evidence even for collateral purpose. But an unregistered 
instrument 
originally 
unstamped, 
if 
duly 
stamped 
subsequently can be admitted in evidence even though it 
continues to be unregistered for collateral purpose but 
actual terms of transaction cannot be looked into. In 
instant case, however settlement deed in question 
produced by defendant was not only unregistered but also 
insufficiently stamped. That apart on an objection raised 
by plaintiff, Court had already passed an order directing 
impounding of document, which was never complied with by defendant. In 
such 
circumstances, 
document 
in 
question, 
which 
still 
remained 
insufficiently stamped could not be admitted in evidence even for collateral 
purpose. Application filed by defendant seeking to admit said document for 
collateral purpose is liable to be dismissed. 
17. REGISTERED DOCUMENTS RELATING TO PROPERTY WHEN TO TAKE 
EFFECT AGAINST ORAL AGREEMENT 
Registered documents relating to any property whether movable or immovable 
shall take effect against any oral agreements or declaration relating to such 
property unless followed by delivery of possession which constitutes a valid transfer 
under any law for the time being in force. (Section 48) 
18. CERTAIN REGISTERED DOCUMENTS RELATING TO LAND WHICH WILL 
TAKE EFFECT AGAINST UNREGISTERED DOCUMENTS 
Section 50 provides as under: 
 (1) Every document of the kinds mentioned in clause (a), (b), (c) and (d) of 
Section 17, Sub-section (1) and clauses (a) and (b) of Section 18, shall if 
duly registered, take effect as regards the property, comprised therein, 
against every unregistered document relating to the same property, and not 
being a decree or order, whether such unregistered document be of the 
same nature as the registered document or not.  
 (2) Nothing in Sub-section (1) applies to leases exempted under the proviso to 
Sub-section (1) of Section 17 or to any document mentioned in Sub-section 
(2) of the same section or to any registered document which had no priority 
under the law in force at the commencement of this Act.

evidence that the document has been legally registered and raises a 
presumption that the registering officer proceeded in accordance with the

24A.  APPEAL TO REGISTRAR 
According to Section 72(1), an appeal shall lie against an order of a Sub-
Registrar refusing to admit a document to registration (whether the registration of 
such document is compulsory or optional) to the Registrar to whom such Sub-
Registrar is subordinate if presented to such Registrar within thirty days from the 
date of the order; and the Registrar may reverse or alter such order. This does not 
apply where the refusal is on the ground of denial of execution.  
If the order of the Registrar directs the document to be registered and the 
document is duly presented for registration within thirty days after the making of 
such order, the Sub-Registrar shall obey the same, and thereupon shall, so far as 
may be practicable, follow the procedure prescribed in Sections 58, 59 and 60; and 
such registration shall take effect as if the document had been registered when it 
was first duly presented for registration. [Section 72(2)] 
EP-GCL-6

24B.  APPLICATION TO REGISTRAR 
Refusal to register on the ground of denial of execution is governed by  
Section 73, under which the aggrieved party can make an ―application‖ not appeal 
to the Registrar. (Section 73) (For denial of execution see Section 35) 
25.  PROCEDURE BEFORE THE REGISTRAR 
In the case falling under Section 73 (refusal to register on the ground of denial 
of execution before the Sub-Registrar) and also where denial of registration is 
made before the Registrar himself, the Registrar shall inquire: 
 (a) whether the document has been executed; and 
 (b) whether the requirements of the law have been satisfied so as to entitle the 
document to registration. (Section 74) 
If a person denies execution, the Sub-Registrar must refuse registration 
leaving the parties to appeal under Section 73 (Chhotey Lal v. Collector of 
Moradabad, AIR 1922 PC 279). Ultimate remedy is a suit under Section 77 (Ka 
Plinis Mysthong v. Ring Pyrbot, AIR 1965 A.N. 42).  
26.  ORDER BY REGISTRAR TO REGISTER AND PROCEDURE THEREON 
If the Registrar finds that the document has been executed and that the said 
requirements have been complied with, he shall order the document to be 
registered (Section 75). 
27.  INSTITUTION OF SUIT IN CASE OF ORDER OF REFUSAL BY REGISTRAR 
Where the Registrar refuses to order the document to be registered any person 
claiming under such document, or his representative, assign or agent, may, within 
thirty days after the making of the order of refusal, institute in the Civil Court, within 
the local limits of whose original jurisdiction is situate the office in which the 
document is sought to be registered a suit for a decree directing the document to 
be registered in such office if it be duly presented for registration within thirty days 
after the passing of such decree. (Section 77)

require, or to have at any time required, the registration of any of the following 
documents or maps, namely: 
 
(a) documents issued, received or attested by any officer engaged in 
making a settlement or revision of settlement of land revenue and 
which form part of the records of such settlement; or 
 
(b) documents and maps issued, received or authenticated by any officer 
engaged on behalf of Government in making or revising the survey of 
any land which form part of the record of such survey; or 
 
(c) documents which, under any law for the time being in force are filed 
periodically in any revenue office by patwaris or other officers charged 
with the preparation of village records; or 
 
(d) sanads, inam, title deeds and other documents purporting to be an 
evidence, grants or assignments by Government of land or of any 
interest in land; or  
 
(e) notices given under section 74 or section 76 of the Bombay Land 
Revenue Code, 1879 of relinquishment of occupancy by occupants or 
of land by holders of such land.  
 (2) All such documents and maps shall for the purposes of Sections 48 and 49, 
be deemed to have been, and to be, registered in accordance with the 
provisions of this Act. (Section 90) 
  
LESSON ROUND-UP 
 
 
Registration of documents relating to immovable property is compulsory. 
Registration of  will is optional. Some documents though related to immovable 
property are not required to be registered. These are given in Section 17(2) of the 
Act. 
 
Document should be submitted for registration within four months from date of 
execution. Decree or order of Court can be submitted within four months from the 
day it becomes final. If document is executed by several persons at different 
times, it may be presented for registration within four months from date of each 
execution. If a document is executed abroad by some of the parties, it can be 
presented for registration within four months after its arrival in India. 
 
If a person finds that a document has been filed for registration by a person who 
is not empowered to do so, he   can   present the document for re-registration 
within four months from the date he became aware of the fact that registration of 
document is invalid. 
 
Documents relating to immovable property should be registered in the office of 
Sub-Registrar of sub-district within which the whole or some portion of property is 
EP-GCL-6 
320 
situated. Other documents can be registered in the office of Sub-Registrar. 
Where all persons executing the document desire it to be registered. Registrar 
can accept a document which is registrable with Sub-Registrar who is 
subordinate to him. Document should be presented for registration at the office of 
Registrar/Sub-Registrar. However, in special case, the officer may attend 
residence of any person to accept a document or will. 
 
All persons executing the document or their representatives, assign or agents 
holding power of attorney must appear before registering officer. They have to 
admit execution and sign the document in presence of Registrar, as required 
under Section 58(1)(a). Appearance may be simultaneous or at different times. If 
some of the persons are unable to appear within four months, further time upto 
additional four months can be given on payment of fine upto 10 times the proper 
registration fee. 
 
If the Registering Officer is satisfied about identity of persons and if they admit 
about execution of documents, and after registration fees are paid, the registering 
officer will register the document. He will make necessary entries in the Register 
maintained by him. 
 
After all formalities are complete, the Registering Officer will endorse the 
document with the word ‗Registered‘, and sign the same. The endorsement will 
be copied in Register. After registration, the document will be returned to the 
person who presented the document. 
 
A document takes effect from its date of execution and not from date of 
registration. However, if the document states that it will be effective from a 
particular date, it will be effective from that date. 
 
Any non-testamentary document registered under the Act takes effect against 
any oral agreement relating to the property. The only exceptions are: (a) if 
possession of property (movable or immovable) is delivered on the basis of such 
oral agreement and such delivery of possession is valid transfer under any law 
(b) mortgage by deposit of title deeds takes effect against any mortgage deed 
subsequently executed and registered which relates to some property.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
―Information technology‖, in a broad sense, connotes that technology which is 
connected with information. More particularly, it connotes that technology which has 
taken shape during the last five decades or so, involving electronics. The use of 
such technology for the storage, retrieval and dissemination of information has 
given rise to several legal, social and ethical problems. In this context, the word 
―information‖ is not to be taken as limited to news or informative material. Rather, it 
is to be understood as encompassing all matter that is intended to be recorded 
electronically, whether it be correspondence, Government documents, legal 
instruments, private exchanges of news and views or any other matter which 
emanates from man and is transformed into machine-recorded data.  
2.  LEGAL PROBLEMS - THEIR NATURE AND DIMENSIONS

themselves are not novel, in their essential character.  But they deserve special

treatment, because of the environment in which they take their birth and the nature 
of the machinery used in the environment and the means employed for recording 
the information in question. Traditional documents are stored and transmitted 
through the use of visible and tangible letters, figures and marks, while information 
which is stored and transmitted electronically, has no visible shape or tangible form. 
It is this peculiarity of the technology, that gives rise to a variety of legal problems. 
These problems can be generally resolved on principles already known to the legal 
system. But in view of their subject matter, they may necessitate some adjustments 
in, and additions to, the content of the law. 
The Machine, the Medium and the Message 
The majority of the legal problems that arise in this sphere are relatable to the 
following components of information technology, namely - 
 (a) The machine (i.e. the instrument used in the technology) 
 (b) The medium used for the purpose (i.e. the symbols and, other means, used 
for recording and transmitting the information) and   
 (c) The message, i.e. the information which is stored or transmitted, through 
the above medium. 
A few illustrations will make the matter clear.  
First, so far as the computers are concerned, they can be tampered with, and 
made to give out results that were never intended. The law has therefore to 
concern itself with the question whether any, and if so, what additional provisions, 
are needed, to deal with this aspect. 
Secondly, there is the question of the medium. Communications with the 
assistance of information technology-particularly through the Internet- cross the 
borders of various countries. They are transnational in character and raise, inter 
alia, problems of jurisdiction. Besides this, the medium by which information is 
recorded - i.e. the operational symbols - are radically different, from the means 
employed in traditional writing or printing.  Traditional means, such as letters, 
numerals or punctuation marks, are not put into the computer in their original form 
(though they do come out in the final print out, in traditional form). 
Finally, as regards the message transmitted through information technology, 
there are certain special issues that fail to be considered. No doubt, the print-out 
that issues from the computer is not substantially different from typed matter. But 
matter put on the internet may, by reason of its content, come into conflict with the 
law of the country where it emanates or the law of the country where it is received. 
How far, is each of these countries legally equipped, to deal with such 
infringement? The answer to this question will depend on the substance of the laws 
of the country concerned. If the contravention is to be examined from the point of 
view of the criminal law, the exact text of the penal statute becomes material.  
The Legal Response 
For dealing with issues of the nature mentioned above (as arising out of the use 
of information technology), some countries have enacted specific legislation. In 
EP-GCL-7 
324 
? 
India, the Information Technology Act, 2000, is an example of such legislation. 
However, in the absence of specific legislation, or in regard to matters not covered 
by such specific legislation, the legal problems that arise will be governed by 
general principles of law  - which are often referred to as principles of ―Common 
Law‖. 
The Uncodified Law 
These principles belong to the uncodified law of India. For example, if, X sends 
out, on the internet, messages that are defamatory of Y, then (apart from instituting 
a criminal prosecution) Y has the right to sue for damages for defamation, which is 
a tort (a species of a civil wrong, independent of contract). Such a remedy is 
available to Y, under the law of torts, which is mostly based upon judicial decisions 
dealing with various kinds of civil wrongs. In such matters, the Information 
Technology Act, 2000, would not supply a complete answer. 
3.  THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACT - ITS ROLE 
Of course, in regard to matters which are dealt with in the 
Information Technology Act, 2000, its specific provisions will apply. 
But a few observations have to be made in this context. The first is, 
that besides the Information Technology Act, there are other 
statutory provisions (as contained in certain other Acts), which are also relevant to 
information technology. In fact, regarding some of these Acts, the Information 
Technology Act itself has effected specific amendments. These include, the Indian 
Penal Code, the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, the Bankers‘ Book Evidence Act, 1891 
and the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934.  
Secondly, even before the Information Technology Act, 2000, came into force, 
Parliament had provided for the maintenance of computerised records, by 
amending the legislation in force relating to customs, excise and companies. 
Thirdly, as pointed out above, many legal issues arising out of the use of 
information technology will continue to be dealt with, by common law rules. Torts 
are an outstanding example. Thus, it can be said that a study of Information 
Technology law has to begin with a study of the Information Technology Act, 2000, 
but cannot end with it.

4.  MAIN OBJECT AND GENERAL SCHEME OF THE ACT 
The Information Technology Act, 2000 (Central Act 21 of 2000), was 
enacted to make, in the main, three kinds of provisions, as under: 
 
(a) It provides legal recognition for transactions carried out by 
means of electronic data interchange and other means of electronic 
communication, usually referred to, as ―electronic Commerce‖.  
 (b) It facilitates the electronic filing of documents with the Government 
agencies, (and also with the publication of rules etc in the electronic form, 
see Section 8). 
 (c) It amends the, Indian Penal Code, the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, the 
Bankers‘ Book Evidence Act, 1891, and the Reserve Bank of India Act, 
1934, so as to bring in electronic documentation within the purview of the 
respective enactments. (see the long title of the Act) 
The Act comprises of 94 Sections, spread out amongst 13 Chapters, followed 
by four Schedules. The topics dealt with in the main Act are as under : 
 (1) preliminary matters  
 (2) digital signatures   
 (3) electronic  governance  
 (4) electronic records  
 (5) secure electronic records and secure digital signatures  
 (6) certifying authorities  
 (7) digital signature certificates  
 (8) duties of subscriber  
 (9) penalties and adjudication  
 (10) the Cyber Regulations Appellate Tribunal  
 (11) offences  
 (12) immunity of net work service providers in certain cases  
 (13) miscellaneous 
The four Schedules annexed to the Act set out the amendments made in four 
Central Acts, so as to weave, into their fabric, the concept of electronic records. 
The four Acts are - 
 (a) the Indian Penal Code  
 (b) the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 
 (c) the Bankers‘ Book Evidence Act, 1891 
 (d) the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. 
5.  DEFINITIONS OF BASIC EXPRESSIONS 
Section 2(1) of the Information Technology Act, 2000, contains definitions of

 (x) ―intermediary‖, with respect to any particular electronic message, means 
any person who, on behalf of another person, receives, stores or transmits 
that message or provides any service with respect to that message. 
[Section 2(1)(w)] 
 (xi) ―key pair‖ in an asymmetric crypto system, means a private key and its 
mathematically related public key, which are so related that the public key 
can verify a digital signature created by the private key. [Section 2(1)(x)] 
 
EP-GCL-7 
327 
? 
 (xii) ―originator‖ means a person who sends, generates, stores or transmits any 
electronic message or causes any electronic message to be sent, 
generated, stored or transmitted to any other person, but does not include 
an intermediary. [Section 2(1)(za)] 
 (xiii) ―prescribed‖ means prescribed by rules made under this Act. [Section 
2(1)(zb)] 
 (xiv) ―private key‖ means the key of a key pair, used to create a digital signature. 
[Section 2(1)(zc)]

use of private key corresponding to the public key of the subscriber; 
 
(b) the initial electronic record is retained intact, or has been altered  since 
such electronic record was so affixed with the digital signature. [Section 
2(1)(zh)] 
6.  DIGITAL SIGNATURE 
Digital signature (i.e. authentication of an electronic record by a subscriber, by 
electronic means) is recognised as a valid method of authentication. The 
authentication is to be effected by the use of ―asymmetric crypto system and hash 
function‖, which envelop and transform electronic record into another electronic 
record. [Sections 3(1), 3(2)] 
Verification of the electronic record is done by the use of a public key of the 
subscriber. [Section 3(3)] The private key and the public key are unique to the 
subscriber and constitute a functioning ―key pair‖.

Addressee is a person who is supposed to receive the information by the originator 
of the message through an intermediary. 
Correct Answer: False 
 
7. 
E- GOVERNANCE (LEGAL RECOGNITION OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS) 
The Act grants legal recognition to electronic records by laying down that where 
(by any law) ―information‖ or any other matter is to be in: 
 (a) writing or  
 (b) typewritten form or 
 (c) printed form, 
EP-GCL-7 
328 
? 
then, such requirement is satisfied, if such information or matter is: 
 
(i) rendered or made available in an electronic form; and 
 (ii) accessible, so as to be usable for a subsequent reference. (Section 4) 
It may be pointed out that ―information‖, as defined in Section 2(1)(v) of the Act, 
includes data, text, images, sound, voice, codes, computer programmes, software 
and data-bases or micro-film or computer-generated ―micro-fiche‖. 
Private transactions 
Thus, Section 4 of the Information Technology Act, practically equates 
electronic record with a manual or typed or printed record. The next Section 
proceeds to achieve the same object in regard to signature. Where any law 
provides that information or any other matter shall be ―signed‖, such requirement is 
satisfied by authentication through digital signature in the prescribed manner. 
(Section 5) 
Thus, while the text of the information is dealt with in section 4, the signature 
thereto, is taken care of, by Section 5.  
Public records 
Above provisions are primarily intended for private transactions. The Act then 
proceeds to bring in the regime of electronic records and digital signature in public 
records, by making an analogous provision which grants recognition to electronic 
records and digital signatures, in cases where any law provides for  
 (a) the filing of any form, application or any other document with a 
Governmental  office or agency or  
 (b) the grant of any licence, permit etc. or   
 (c) the receipt or payment of money in a particular manner. (Section 6) 
8.  RETENTION OF INFORMATION 
 The Act also seeks to permit the retention of information in electronic form, 
where any law provides that certain documents, records or information shall be 
retained for any specific period. Certain conditions as to accessibility, format etc are 
also laid down. (Section 7) 
9.  SUBORDINATE LEGISLATION 
Subordinate legislation is also authorised, by the Act, to be published in the 
Official Gazette or the electronic Gazette, and the date of its first publication in either 
of the two Gazette shall be deemed to be the date of publication. (Section 8) 
But the provisions summarised above shall not confer any right upon any 
person to insist, that any Government agency shall accept, issue etc. any document 
in electronic form or effect any monetary transaction in electronic form. (Section 9)

10.  ATTRIBUTION AND DISPATCH OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS 
Since, in an electronic record, the maker remains behind the curtain, it was 
considered desirable to make a provision for ―attribution‖ of the record. An 
electronic record is attributed to the ―originator‖. [defined in Section 2(1)(za)]  
Broadly, the ―originator‖ is the person at whose instance it was sent in the 
following cases - 
 (a) if it  was sent by the originator himself; or 
 (b) if it was sent by a person authorised to act on behalf of the originator in 
respect of that electronic record; or  
 (c) if it was sent by an information system programmed by or on behalf of the 
originator to operate automatically. (Section 11) 
Regarding acknowledgement of receipt of electronic records, the Act provides 
that where there is no agreement that the acknowledgment be given in a particular 
form etc. then the acknowledgement may be given by: 
 (a) any communication by the addressee (automated or otherwise) or 
 (b) any conduct of the addressee which is sufficient to indicate to the originator 
that the electronic record has been received. [Section 12(1)] 
Special provisions have been made for cases where the originator has 
stipulated for receipt of acknowledgment, [Section 12(b)] or where the 
acknowledgement is not received by the originator in time. [Section 12(2), 12(3)] 
Time and Place of Dispatch etc. 
After these provisions, there follows a provision which is of considerable 
significance for the law of contracts. The date of offer and the date of acceptance 
are crucial, in determining whether and which contract has come into existence. 
The two terminal points - despatch and receipt, are dealt with, in detail. Subject to 
agreement between the parties, the dispatch of an electronic record occurs, when it 
enters a ―computer resource‖ outside the control of the originator.  [Section 13(1)] 
―Computer resource‖, as defined in Section 2(k), means a computer, computer 
system, computer network, data, computer database or software.  
Time of receipt 
As regards the time of receipt of electronic records, two situations are dealt 
with, separately. Subject to agreement, if the addressee has designated a computer 
resource for receipt, then receipt occurs when the electronic record enters the 
designated resource. However, if the record is sent to a computer resource of the 
addressee which is not the designated resource, then receipt occurs at the time 
when the electronic record is retrieved by the addressee. [Section 13(2)(a)] 
If the addressee has not designated a computer resource (with or without 
specified timings), then receipt is deemed to occur, when the electronic record 
EP-GCL-7 
330 
? 
enters the computer resource of the addressee. [Sections 13(1), 13(2)] Above 
provisions apply, even where the place of location of the computer is different from 
the deemed place of receipt.  
The Act also contains provisions as to the place of dispatch and receipt. 
[Section 13(3)] 
 
Test your knowledge 
State whether the following statement is “True” or “False” 
Under the Indian law, a person has a right to demand a Government agency to 
accept an electronic record. 
Correct Answer: False 
 
11.  SECURE ELECTRONIC RECORDS 
The Central Government is required, by the Act, to prescribe the security 
procedure for electronic records, having regard to the commercial circumstances 
prevailing at the time when the procedure is used (Section 16). When the 
procedure has been applied to an electronic record at a specific point of time, then 
such record is deemed to be a secure electronic record, from such point of time to 
the time of verification. (Section 14) Suitable provision is also made regarding 
―secure digital signature‖. 
A digital signature is deemed to be a secure digital signature, if, by the 
application of an agreed security procedure, it can be verified that a digital 
signature, at the time it was verified, - 
 (a) was unique to the subscriber affixing it; 
 (b) was capable of identifying such subscriber; 
 (c) was created in a manner or using a means under the exclusive control of 
the subscriber and is linked to the electronic  record to which it relates, in 
such a manner that if the electronic record was altered, the digital signature 
would be invalidated. (Section 15) 
12.  CERTIFYING AUTHORITIES 
A system of digital signature of an electronic communication pre-supposes that 
the sender must create a ―public -private key‖ pair. The private key, which is kept 
confidential, is used by the signer to create the digital signature. The public key 
(which is more widely known), is used by the relying party, to verify the digital 
signature. 
To associate a key pair with a certifying prospective signer, the Certifying 
Authority issues a certificate to the subscriber. (Section 35) 
The Act contains detailed provisions as to ―Certifying Authorities‖ (Sections 17-
34). A Certifying Authority is expected to reliably identify persons applying for 
 
EP-GCL-7 
331 
? 
―signature key certificates‖, reliably verify their legal capacity and confirm the 
attribution of a public signature key to an identified physical person by means of a 
signature key certificate. To regulate the Certifying Authorities, there is a Controller 
of Certifying Authorities. (Section 17) 
Foreign Certifying Authorities may be recognised by the Controller. (Section 19) 
The Controller acts as the repository of all Digital Signature Certificates, issued 
under the Act. [Section 20(1)] 
―Repositories‖ are on-line data-bases of certificates and other information, 
available for retrieval and use in verifying digital signatures. Obligations of 
Certifying Authorities are also set out, in the Act. (Sections 30-34) 
Digital signature certificates 
Sections 35-39 of the Act deal with Digital Signature Certificates. 
Duties of subscribers  
Duties of subscribers are dealt with, in the Information Technology Act, in some 
detail. (Sections 40-42) 
 
Test your knowledge 
A digital signature is: 
 (a) Unique to the subscriber affixing it 
 (b) Capable of identifying the subscriber 
 (c) Capable of identifying the addressee 
 (d) Created in a manner or using a means under the exclusive control of the 
subscriber 
Correct Answer: (a), (b), (d) 
 
13.  PENALTIES AND ADJUDICATIONS 
The Act contemplates a dual scheme in regard to wrongful acts concerning 
computers etc. Certain acts are visited with (so called) ―penalties‖, which are 
however, adjudicated, not before courts, but before adjudication officers. (Sections 
43-47) 
In fact, however, though the heading of Section 43 speaks of ―penalty‖, the text 
of Section 43 imposes only a liability ―to pay damages by way of compensation not 
exceeding one crore rupees‖, to the person harmed by the tort. The acts so dealt 
with, include the following – 
 (a) accessing or securing access to the computer network; 
 (b) down-loading any data or information from the computer network; 
 (c) introducing (or causing to be introduced) any computer contaminant or 
computer virus, into the computer/network; 
EP-GCL-7 
332 
? 
 (d) damaging (or causing to be damaged) the computer/network, data, 
computer data-base or any other programmes residing in it; 
 (e) disrupting (or causing the disruption of) the computer/network; 
 
(f) denying access (or causing the denial of access) to any person authorised 
to access the computer/network, by any means; 
 (g) providing assistance to any person to facilitate access to the computer 
network in contravention of the provisions of the Act, rules etc. 
 (h) charging the service availed of, by a person, to the account of another 
person, by tampering with or manipulating any computer network  
(Section 43). 
The Explanation to the Section sets out definitions of the expressions 
―computer contaminant‖, ―computer database‖, ―computer virus‖ and ―damages‖.  
A person failing to provide information or failing to file a return etc. (as required 
by the Act), has to pay a penalty not exceeding ten thousand rupees for every day 
during which the failure continues. (Section 44) 
Contravention of a rule or regulation attracts liability to pay compensation upto 
25,000 rupees, to the person affected by such contravention or to pay penalty upto 
that amount. (Section 45) 
Adjudicating officer 
An adjudication officer is to be appointed by the Central Government for 
adjudging (under this Chapter) whether any person has committed a contravention 
of the Act or of any rule, regulation, direction or order issued under the Act. He may 
impose penalty or award compensation in accordance with the provisions of the 
relevant section (Section 46). 
The Act takes-care to set out the factors to be taken into account by the 
Adjudicating officer, in adjudging the quantum of compensation under this Chapter. 
He has to have due regard to the following factors: 
 (a) the amount of gain or unfair advantage (wherever quantifiable), made as a  
result of the default; 
 (b) the amount of loss caused to any person as a result of the default; and 
 (c) the repetitive nature of the default.

14.  CYBER REGULATIONS APPELLATE TRIBUNAL 
Chapter 10 of the Act provides for the establishment of one or more Cyber 
Regulations Appellate Tribunal and lays down various provisions regarding its 
jurisdiction, composition, powers and procedure. (Sections 48-62) 
In the same Chapter, there are provisions regarding the compounding of 
offences and recovery of penalties. (Sections 63 and 64).  
Any person aggrieved by an order of the Controller of Certifying Authorities or 
of the adjudicator can appeal to the Cyber Appellate Tribunal, within 45 days. 
(Section 57) 
Each Cyber Appellate Tribunal is to consist of only one person (called the 
presiding officer). He must be a person who is, or has been or is qualified to be, a 
High Court Judge or a person who is, or has been a member of the Indian Legal 
Service and who has held a post in Grade I of the Service for at least 3 years.  
The presiding office holds office for 5 years or until he attains the age of 65 
years, whichever is earlier.  
Any person aggrieved by ―any decision or order‖ of the Tribunal may appeal to 
the High Court, within 60 days. Jurisdiction of Civil Courts is barred, in respect of 
any matter which an adjudicating officer or the Cyber Appellate Tribunal has power 
to determine. 
15.  OFFENCES 
Chapter 11 of the Act, (Sections 65-78) deals with offences relating to 
computers etc. and connected matters. This Chapter also contains certain 
provisions empowering the Controller of Certifying Authorities to issue certain 
directions to certifying Authorities (Section 68) and to subscribers (Section 69). 
There is also a provision for confiscation. (Section 76) 
The offences listed in this Chapter are the following -  
 
(a) Tampering with computer source documents; 
 
(b) ―Hacking‖ with computer systems; (See below) 
 
(c) Publishing of obscene information in electronic form; 
 (d) Securing access to any computer, computer system or computer network 
declared by the appropriate Government to be a ―protected system‖; 
 (e) Misrepresentation about a material fact to, or suppression of a  material fact 
from, the Controller or the Certifying Authority; 
 
(f) Breach of confidentiality and privacy, by a person who has,  in the exercise 
of a power conferred by the Act, secured access to electronic  record, book, 
register etc.; 
 (g) Publishing a digital signature certificate, which is false in certain particulars; 
 (h) Knowing, creating, publishing etc. a Digital Signature Certificate, for any 
fraudulent or unlawful purpose.

Hacking 
Regarding hacking, Section 66 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, 
provides as under - 
Hacking with computer system 
 
(i) Whoever, with intent to cause, or knowing that he is likely  to cause, 
wrongful loss or damage to the public or any person, destroys or deletes or 
alters any information residing in a computer resource or diminishes its 
value or utility or affects it injuriously by any means, commits hacking. 
 (ii) Whoever commits hacking, shall be punished with imprisonment upto three 
years or with fine which may extend upto two lakh rupees or with both.

Investigation 
Only a police officer of the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police is 
competent to investigate an offence under the Information Technology Act. 
Extraterritorial operation 
Extra-territorial operation of the Act is provided for, by enacting that the 
provisions of the Act apply to any offence or contravention committed outside India 
by any person, irrespective of his nationality, if the act or conduct in question 
involves a computer, computer system or computer network located in India. 
(Section 75) 
16.  LIABILITY OF NETWORK SERVICE PROVIDERS 
The Internet system depends, for its working, on network service providers- i.e. 
intermediaries. An ―intermediary‖, with respect to any particular electronic message, 
means any person who, on behalf of another person, receives, stores or transmits 
that message or provides any service with respect to that message. [Section 
2(1)(w)] 
In his capacity as an intermediary, a network service provider may have to 
handle matter which may contravene the Act. To avoid such a consequence, the 
Act declares that no network service provider shall be liable ―under this Act, rule or 
 
EP-GCL-7 
335 
regulation made thereunder‖, for any third party information or data made available 
by him, if he proves that the offence or contravention was committed without his 
knowledge or that he had exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of 
such offence or contravention. (Section 79) 
17.  DOMAIN NAMES 
It is vital, that prior to entering into any type of business activity, a company 
must be traceable relatively easily, on the Internet, i.e. it must have an address in 
cyber-space. This may be linked to a company having its Registered Office to 
which all communications are usually directed. This explains the utility of 
registration under a particular domain name and website. This has been made 
possible with the emergence of the Domain Name System (―DNS‖). Such 
registration would enable the company to conduct on-line transactions, as well as 
make it easily traceable by customers, suppliers, etc. 
18.  PASSING OFF 
The Information Technology Act does not contain a specific provision, declaring 
illegal any fraudulent use, by one person, of other persons domain name.  
However, even in the absence of specific legislation on the subject, such conduct 
can become actionable under the law of torts. In fact, judicial decisions, both in 
India and elsewhere, amply demonstrate the potency of the law of torts in this 
context. The tort of ―passing off‖ is wide enough to afford legal redress (in 
damages) to a person who is the holder of a particular domain name and who 
suffers harm as a result of the fraudulent use of his domain name by another 
person. Such conduct has been regarded as falling under the tort of ―passing off‖. 
The crux of the action of “passing off” lies in actual or possible 
or probable deception. The principles relating to “passing off” 
were held to be applicable to domain names in Rediff 
Communication Ltd. v. Cyberbooth, (2000) 1 Recent Arbitraton 
Judgements, 562 (Bombay High Court). 
The domain name “Rediff” (of the plaintiff) and the domain name “Rediff” (of 
the defendant) were held to be deceptively similar and capable of causing 
deception, as the fields of business activity of both the parties were similar. 
The grant of a temporary injunction, restraining the defendant from using the 
name in question, was held to be proper. 
A similar view has been taken in Yahoo Inc. v. Akash Arora, (1999) 2 Recent 
Arbitration Judgements, 176 (Delhi). The plaintiff’s domain name was 
“Yahoo”. The defendant’s domain name was “Yahoo India”. The two were 
held to be similar, even though the defendants had suffixed the word “India”. 
It was held that, even if a user of Internet is a sophisticated user, he may be 
an unsophisticated consumer of information and he may unintentionally find 
his way to a different Internet size. In this manner, confusion could be 
created.

LESSON ROUND-UP 
 
 
The Information Technology Act has been passed to give effect to the UN 
resolution and to promote efficient delivery of Government services by means of 
reliable electronic records. The Act came into effect on 17.10.2000. 
 
The purpose of the Act is (a) to provide legal recognition for transactions carried 
out by means of electronic data interchange and other means of electronic 
communication, commonly referred to as ―electronic commerce‖, which involve 
the use of alternatives to paper-based methods of communication and storage of 
information and (b) to facilitate electronic filing of documents with the 
Government agencies. 
 
Any subscriber may authenticate an electronic record by affixing his digital 
signature. 
 
―Digital Signature‖ means authentication of any electronic record by a subscriber 
by means of an electronic method or procedure in accordance with the provisions 
of Section 3 of the Act. 
 
Any person by the use of a public key of the subscriber can verify the electronic 
record. The private key and the public key are unique to the subscriber and 
constitute a functioning key pair. 
 
Where any law provides that information or any other matter shall be 
authenticated by affixing the signature or any document shall be signed or bear 
the signature of any person then, notwithstanding anything contained in such law, 
such requirement shall be deemed to have been satisfied, if such information or 
matter is authenticated by means of digital signature affixed in such manner as 
may be prescribed by the Central Government. 
 
The digital signature will be certified by ‗Certifying Authority‘. The ‗certified 
authority‘ will be licensed, supervised and controlled by ‗Controller of Certifying 
Authorities‘. 
 
The Act contemplates a dual scheme in regard to wrongful acts concerning 
computers, etc. Certain acts are visited with (so called) ―penalties‖, which are 
however, adjudicated, not before courts, but before adjudication officers. 
 
EP-GCL-7 
337 
 
The Act provides for the establishment of one or more Cyber Regulations 
Appellate Tribunal and lays down various provisions regarding its jurisdiction, 
composition, powers and procedure.  
 
Any person aggrieved by an order of the Controller of Certifying Authorities or of 
the adjudicator can appeal to the Cyber Appellate Tribunal, within 45 days. 
 
Any person aggrieved by ―any decision or order‖ of the Tribunal may appeal to 
the High Court, within 60 days. Jurisdiction of Civil Courts is barred, in respect of 
any matter which an adjudicating officer or the Cyber Appellate Tribunal has 
power to determine. 
 
Chapter 11 of the Act spells out provisions regarding offences relating to 
computers, etc. This chapter also contains provisions empowering the Controller 
of Certifying Authorities to issue certain directions to Certifying Authorities and to 
subscribers. There is also a provision for confiscation. 
 
The Information Technology Act does not contain any specific provision, 
declaring illegal any fraudulent use, by one person, of other person‘s domain 
name. However, even in the absence of specific legislation on the subject, such 
conduct can become actionable under the law of torts. In fact, judicial decisions, 
both in India and elsewhere, amply demonstrate the potency of the law of torts in 
this context.

STUDY VIII 
THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE, 1908 (C.P.C.) 
  
 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Laws can be divided into two groups: (i) substantive law; and (ii) procedural law. 
Whereas substantive law determines rights and liabilities of parties, procedural or 
adjective law prescribes practice, procedure and machinery for the enforcement of 
those rights and liabilities. Procedural law is thus an adjunct or an accessory to 
substantive law. The Code of Civil Procedure is an adjective law it neither creates nor 
takes away any right. It is intended to regulate the procedure to be followed by civil 
courts. 
The students need to be familiar with the essentials of the basic procedural laws of 
the country. It is necessary for them to keep in view the requirement of the procedural 
law in handling of corporate business, even in initial stages or later, which could have 
legal implications at some subsequent stage. 
At the end of the Study Lesson you should be able to understand: 
 
Aim and scope of Civil Procedure Code 
 
Important definitions 
 
Structure and jurisdiction of civil courts 
 
Place of suing 
 
Res judicata

1.  INTRODUCTION 
The Company Secretary and the Secretarial Staff of a Company need to be 
familiar with the essentials of the basic procedural laws of the country. While the 
specific corporate, industrial, taxation, property and urban land laws have direct 
relevance for the efficient performance of the duties and responsibilities of the 
Company Secretary, the procedural law also provides the parameters for the 
pursuance of legal action. It is also therefore necessary to keep in view the 
338 
 
EP-GCL-8 
339 
? 
requirement of the procedural law, or as such law is often termed "adjective law", in 
the handling of corporate business, even in initial stages or later, which could have 
legal implications at some subsequent stage. Such monitoring and guidance is 
required to be rendered by the Company Secretary and other Secretarial Executives 
to the line management for safeguarding the interests of the company. It has been 
endeavoured in this Chapter to summarise one of such aspects of Indian procedural 
laws which have to be referred to by the Company Secretaries. 
2.  AIM AND SCOPE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE CODE, 1908 [C.P.C.] 
The Civil Procedure Code consolidates and amends the law relating to the 
procedure of the Courts of Civil jurisdiction. The Code does not affect any special or 
local laws nor does it supersede any special jurisdiction or power conferred or any 
special form of procedure prescribed by or under any other law for the time being in 
force. The Code is the general law so that in case of conflict between the Code and 
the special law the latter prevails over the former. Where the special law is silent on a 
particular matter the Code applies, but consistent with the special enactment. Thus it 
is seen for instance, that the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 
and the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission Regulations, 1991 
(Regulations 62, 64 etc.) have adopted various relevant provisions of the Code, while 
the provisions of the Code are not applicable for Regulation 50, 65 etc. Similarly the 
Companies (Bench) Rules also lay down the special procedure for proceedings of the 
company law cases. 
3.  SCHEME OF THE CODE 
The Civil Procedure Code  consists  of  two  parts.  158 Sections form the first 
part and the rules and orders contained in Schedule I form the second part. The 
object of the Code generally is to create jurisdiction while the rules indicate the mode 
in which the jurisdiction should be exercised. Thus the two parts should be read 
together, and in case of any conflict between the body and the rules, the former must 
prevail.

4.  SOME IMPORTANT TERMS 
Cause of Action 
"Cause of action" means every fact that it would be necessary for the plaintiff to 
prove in order to support his right to the judgement of  the Court.  Under  Order 2, 
EP-GCL-8 
340 
Rule 2, of the Civil Procedure Code it means all the essential facts constituting the 
rights and its infringement. It means every fact which will be necessary for the plaintiff 
to prove, if traversed in order to support his right to the judgement. 
Judgement, Decree and Order  
"Judgement" as defined in Section 2(9) of the Civil Procedure Code means the 
statement given by the Judge on the grounds of a decree or order. Thus a judgement 
must set out the grounds and reasons for the Judge to have arrived at the decision. 
In other words, a "judgement" is the decision of a Court of justice upon the 
respective rights and claims of the parties to an action in a suit submitted to it 
for determination (State of Tamilnadu v. S. Thangaval, AIR (1997) S.C. 2283). 
"Decree" is defined in Section 2(2) of the Code as (i) the formal expression of an 
adjudication which, so far as regards the Court expressing it; (ii) conclusively; (iii) 
determines the rights of the parties; (iv) with regard to all or any of the matters in 
controversy; (v) in the suit and may be either preliminary (i.e. when further 
proceedings have to be taken before disposal of the suit) or final. 
But decree does not include: 
 (a) any adjudication from which an appeal lies as an appeal from an Order, or 
 (b) any order of dismissal for default. 
Essentials of a decree are: 
 
(i) There must be a formal expression of adjudication; 
 (ii) There must be a conclusive determination of the rights of parties; 
 (iii) The determination must be with regard to or any of the matters in 
contravention in the suit; 
 (iv) The adjudication should have been given in the suit. 
According to the explanation to the definition, a decree may be partly preliminary 
and partly final. A decree comes into existence as soon as the judgement is 
pronounced and not on the date when it is sealed and signed. (Order 20 Rule 7) 
A decree is preliminary when further proceedings have to be taken before the suit 
can be completely disposed of. The preliminary decree is not dependent on the final. 
On the other hand, final decree is dependent and subordinate to the preliminary 
decree, and gives effect to it. The preliminary decree ascertains what is to be done 
while the final decree states the result achieved by means of the preliminary decree. 
If the preliminary decree is set aside the final decree is automatically superseded. 
Decree-holder 
"Decree-holder" means any person in whose favour a decree has been passed or 
an order capable of execution has been made. [Section 2(3)] Thus, a person who is 
not a party to the suit but in whose favour an order capable of execution is passed is 
a decree-holder. 
Judgement-debtor 
"Judgement-debtor" means any person against whom a decree has been passed 
or an order capable of execution has been made. [Section 2(10)] The definition does 
not include legal representative of a deceased judgement-debtor. 
 
EP-GCL-8 
341 
Judgement 
The "judgement" means a statement given by a judge on the grounds of a decree 
or order [Section 2(9)]. What is ordinarily called as an order is in fact a judgement. 
Also an order deciding a primary issue is a judgement. 
Order 
"Order" as set out in Section 2(14) of the Code means the formal expression of 
any decision of a Civil Court which is not a decree. 
According to Section 104 of the Code, no appeal lies against orders other than 
what is expressly provided in the Code or any other law for the time being in force. 
Under the Code appealable orders are: 
 
(i) an order under Section 35A, i.e. for compensatory costs in respect of false or 
vexatious claims within pecuniary jurisdiction of the Court, but only for the 
limited ground that no order should have been made, or that such order 
should have been made for a lesser amount. 
 (ii) an order under Section 91 or Section 92 refusing leave to institute a suit 
under Section 91 (Public nuisances and other wrongful acts affecting the 
public) or Section 92 (alleged breach of trust created for public purposes of a 
charitable or religious nature). 
 (iii) an order under Section 95, i.e. compensation for obtaining arrest attachment 
or injunction on insufficient grounds. 
 (iv) an order under any of the provisions of the Code imposing a fine or directing 
the arrest or detention in the civil prison of any person except where such 
arrest or detention is in execution of a decree. 
 (v) any order made under rules from which an appeal is expressly allowed by the 
rules. 
No appeal lies from any order passed in appeal under this section. 
In the case of other orders, no appeal lies except where a decree is appealed 
from, any error, defect or irregularity in any order affecting the decision of the case 
which is to be set forth as a ground of objection in the memorandum of appeal. 
A decree, shall be deemed to include the rejection of a plaint but not any 
adjudication from which an appeal lies or any order of dismissal for default. A 
preliminary decree decides the rights of parties on all or any of the matters in 
controversy in the suit but does not completely dispose of the suit. A preliminary 
decree may be appealed against and does not lose its appellate character by reason 
of a final decree having been passed before the appeal is presented. The Court may, 
on the application of any party to a suit, pass orders on different applications and any 
order which is not the final order in a suit is called an “interlocutory order”. An 
interlocutory order does not dispose of the suit but is merely a direction to procedure. 
It reserves some questions for further determination. 
The main difference between an order and a decree is that when in an 
adjudication which is a decree appeal lies and second appeal also lies on the 
grounds mentioned in Section 100 of CPC. However, no appeal lies from an order 
unless it is expressly provided under Section 104 and Order 43 Rule 1. No second 
EP-GCL-8 
342 
? 
appeal in any case lies at all even in case of appealable orders. [Section 104(2)] A 
decree conclusively determines the rights and liabilities of the parties with regard to 
all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit and may be either preliminary or 
final but this is not the case in order. 
A person in whose favour a decree has been passed not only includes a plaintiff 
but in cases like decree for specific performance of an agreement executable by 
either party, also includes a defendant.

 (a) There must be a formal expression of adjudication 
 (b) There must be a conclusive determination of the rights of parties 
 (c) The adjudication should have been given in the suit 
 (d) All the above 
Correct answer: (d) 
 
5.  STRUCTURE OF CIVIL COURTS 
Section 3 of the Civil Procedure Code lays down that for the purposes of this 
Code, the District Court is subordinate to the High Court and every Civil Court of a 
grade inferior to that of a District and every Court of small causes is subordinate to 
the High Court and District Court. 
6.  JURISDICTION OF COURTS AND VENUE OF SUITS 
Jurisdiction means the authority by which a Court has to decide 
matters that are brought before it for adjudication. The limit of this 
authority is imposed by charter, statute or a commission. If no such 
limit is imposed or defined, the jurisdiction is said to be unlimited. A 
limitation on jurisdiction of a Civil Court may be of four kinds. These are as follows :- 
(i)  jurisdiction over the subject matter 
The jurisdiction to try certain matters by certain Court is limited by statute; e.g. a 
small cause court can try suits for money due under a promissory note or a suit for 
price of work done. 
(ii)  Place of suing or territorial jurisdiction 
A territorial limit of jurisdiction for each court is fixed by the Government. Thus, it 
can try matters falling within the territorial limits of its jurisdiction. 
(iii)  Jurisdiction over persons 
All persons of whatever nationality are subject to the jurisdiction of the Civil 
Courts of the country except a foreign State, it‟s Ruler or its representative except 
with the consent of Central Government. 
 
EP-GCL-8 
343 
(iv)  Pecuniary jurisdiction depending on pecuniary value of the suit 
Section 6 deal with Pecuniary jurisdiction and lays down that save in so far as is 
otherwise expressly provided Courts shall only have jurisdiction over suits the amount 
or value of which does not exceed the pecuniary limits of any of its ordinary 
jurisdiction. There is no limit on pecuniary jurisdiction of High Courts and District 
Courts. 
Jurisdiction may be further classified into following categories depending upon 
their powers: 
 
(i) Original Jurisdiction — A Court tries and decides suits filed before it. 
 (ii) Appellate Jurisdiction — A Court hears appeals against decisions or decrees 
passed by sub-ordinate Courts. 
 (iii) Original and appellate Jurisdiction — The Supreme Court, the High Courts 
and the District Courts have both original and appellate jurisdiction in various 
matters. 
Courts to try all civil suits unless barred : Section 9 of Civil Procedure Code 
states that the Courts shall have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature excepting 
suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred. The 
explanation appended to the Section provides that a suit in which the right to property 
or to an office is contested is a suit of civil nature, notwithstanding that such right may 
depend entirely on the decision on questions as a religious rites or ceremonies. 
Civil Courts have jurisdiction to entertain a suit of civil nature unless barred by 
law. Every person has an inherent right to bring a suit of a 
civil nature. Civil Court has jurisdiction to decide the 
question of its jurisdiction although as a result of the 
enquiry it may be found that it has no jurisdiction over the 
matter. Jurisdiction depends not on the truth or falsehood 
of facts, but upon their nature. Jurisdiction is determinable 
at the commencement not at the conclusion of the inquiry 
(Rex v. Boltan, (1841) 1 QB 66, 74). 
A suit is expressly barred if a legislation expressly says so and it is impliedly 
barred if a statute creates new right or liability and prescribes a particular tribunal or 
forum for its assertion. When a right is created by a statute and a special tribunal or 
forum is provided for its assertion and enforcement, the ordinary Civil Court would 
have no jurisdiction to entertain such disputes. 
7.  STAY OF SUIT (DOCTRINE OF RES SUB JUDICE) 
Section 10 provides that no Court shall proceed with the trial of any suit in which 
the matter in issue is also directly and substantially in issue in a previously instituted 
suit between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them 
claim, litigating under the same title, where such suit is pending in the same or any 
other Court (in India) having jurisdiction to grant the relief claimed, or in any Court 
beyond the limits of India established or continued by the Central Government and 
having like jurisdiction, or before the Supreme Court. 
However, the pendency of a suit in a foreign court does not preclude the Courts 
in India from trying a suit founded on the same cause of action. 
EP-GCL-8 
344 
To prevent Courts of concurrent jurisdiction from simultaneously trying two 
parallel suits in respect of same matter in issue, Section 10 is enacted. The purpose 
is also to avoid conflict of decision. It is really intended to give effect to the rule of res 
judicata. The institution of second suit is not barred by Section 10. It merely says that 
the trial cannot be proceeded with. 
A suit was instituted by the plaintiff company alleging infringement by the 
defendant company by using trade name of medicine and selling the same in 
wrapper and carton of identical design with same colour 
combination etc. as that of plaintiff company. A subsequent 
suit was instituted in different Court by the defendant 
company 
against 
the 
plaintiff 
company 
with 
same 
allegation. The Court held that subsequent suit should be 
stayed as simultaneous trial of the suits in different Courts 
might result in conflicting decisions as issue involved in 
two suits was totally identical (M/s. Wings Pharmaceuticals (P) Ltd. and another 
v. M/s. Swan Pharmaceuticals and others, AIR 1999 Pat. 96). 
Even though if a case is not governed by the provisions of the Section and 
matters in issue may not be identical, yet the courts have inherent powers to stay suit 
on principle analogous to Section 10. 
Essential conditions for stay of suits 
 
(i) There must be two suits instituted at different times; 
 (ii) The matter in issue in the later suit should be directly and substantially in 
issue in the earlier suit; 
 (iii) Such suit should be between the same parties; 
 (iv) Such earlier suit is still pending either in the same Court or in any other 
competent Court but not before a foreign Court. 
If these conditions exist, the later suit should be stayed till the disposal of earlier 
suit, the findings of which operate as res judicata on the later suit. 
For the applicability of Section 10, the two proceedings must be suits e.g. suit for 
eviction of tenant in a rent control statute cannot be sought to be stayed under 
Section 10 of Civil Procedure Code on the ground that tenant has earlier filed a suit 
for specific performance against the landlord on the basis of agreement of sale of 
disputed premises in favour of the tenant. 
In such a case, it cannot be said that the matter in earlier suit for specific 
performance is directly and substantially in issue in later suit for eviction. The reason 
is that a suit for specific performance of contract has got nothing to do with the 
question regarding the relationship of landlord and tenant. 
Regarding the inherent powers under Section 151, these would also not be used 
for staying the eviction suit as the same would frustrate the very purpose of the 
legislation. Therefore, invoking the powers of the Court under this Section, on the 
facts and circumstances of the case amounts to an abuse of the process of the Court 
and there can be no doubt that such a course cannot be said to subserve the ends of 
the justice (N.P. Tripathi v. Dayamanti Devi, AIR 1988 Pat. 123).

8.  PLACE OF SUING (TERRITORIAL) 
Section 15 lays down that every suit shall be instituted in the Court of the lowest 
grade to try it. 
According to Section 16, subject to the pecuniary or other limitations prescribed 
by any law, the following suits (relating to property) shall be instituted in the Court 
within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the property is situated : 
 (a) for recovery of immovable property with or without rent or profits; 
 (b) for partition of immovable property; 
 (c) for foreclosure of sale or redemption in the case of a mortgage or charge 
upon immovable property; 
 (d) for the determination of any other right to or interest in immovable property; 
 (e) for compensation for wrong to immovable property; 
 
(f) for the recovery of movable property actually distraint or attachment. 
It has also been provided by a proviso that where relief could be obtained 
through personal obedience of the defendant such suit to obtain relief for 
compensation or respecting immovable property can be instituted either in a local 
Court within whose local limits of jurisdiction the property is situated or in the Court 
within whose local limits of jurisdiction the defendant voluntarily resides or carries on 
business or personally works for gain. 
According to the Explanation, "property" means property situated in India. 
Where immovable property is situated within the jurisdiction of different Courts: 
Where the jurisdiction for a suit is to obtain relief respecting, or compensation for 
wrong to immovable property situated within the local limits of jurisdiction of different 
Courts, the suit may be instituted in any Court within the local limits of whose 
jurisdiction the property is situated provided the value of the entire claim is cognisable 
by such Court. (Section 17) 
Where local limits of jurisdiction of Courts are uncertain: Where jurisdiction is 
alleged to be uncertain as being within the local limits of the jurisdiction of which of 
EP-GCL-8 
346 
two or more Courts, any immovable property is situated, then any of the said Courts 
may proceed to entertain the suit after having recorded a statement to the effect that 
it is satisfied that there is ground for such alleged uncertainty. (Section 18) 
Where wrong done to the person or to movable property : Where a suit is for 
compensation for wrong done to the person or to movable property, if the wrong was 
done within the local limits of the jurisdiction of one Court and the defendant resides, 
or carries on business, or personally works for gain, within the local limits of the 
jurisdiction of another Court, the suit may be instituted at the option of the plaintiff in 
either of the Courts. (Section 19) 
Other suits: Other suits to be instituted where defendants reside or cause of 
action arises, subject to the limitations provided by Sections 15, 16, 18 and 19, every 
suit shall be instituted in a Court within local limits of whose jurisdiction the defendant, 
or each of the defendants (where there are more than one defendant) actually and 
voluntarily resides or carries on business or personally works for gain or where such 
defendants actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or personally works 
for gain, provided either the leave of the Court is obtained or the defendant(s) who do 
not reside or carry on business or personally work for gain at such place acquisce in 
such institution or, where the cause of action arises, wholly or in part. (Section 20) 
In the case of a body corporate or company it shall be deemed to carry on 
business at its sole or principal office in India, or in case of any cause of action 
arising at any other place, if it has a subordinate office, at such place. 
Where there might be two or more competent courts which could entertain 
a suit consequent upon a part of cause of action having arisen therewith if 
the parties to the contract agreed to vest jurisdiction in one such court to 
try the dispute. Such an agreement would be valid (Angile Insulations v. 
Davy Ashmore India Ltd., (1995) 3 SCALE 203). 
9.  RES JUDICATA 
Section 11 of the Civil Procedure Code deals with the doctrine of Res Judicata 
that is, bar or restraint on repetition of litigation of the same issues. It is a pragmatic 
principle accepted and provided in law that there must be a limit or end to litigation on 
the same issues. 
The doctrine underlines the general principle that no one shall be 
twice vexed for the same cause (S.B. Temple v. V.V.B. Charyulu, 
(1971) 1 SCJ 215). The doctrine of res judicata prevails over the 
doctrine of lis pendens where there is a conflict between the two. 
It prevents two different decrees on the same subject. Section 11 says that once 
a res is judicata, it shall not be adjudged again. The principle applies to suits in 
Section 11 of the Code; but even where Section 11 does not apply, the principle of 
res judicata has been applied by Courts for the purpose of giving finality to litigation. 
For the applicability of the principle of res judicata embodied in Section 11, the 
following requirements are necessary: 
(1)  The matter directly and substantially in issue in former suit shall also be 
directly and substantially in issue in later suit. 
 
EP-GCL-8 
347 
The expression “directly and substantially in issue” means an issue alleged 
by one party and denied or admitted by the another either expressly or by 
necessary implications (Lonakutty v. Thomman, AIR 1976 SC 1645). 
In the matter of taxation for levy of Municipal taxes, there is no question of res 
judicata as each year‟s assessment is final for that year and does not govern latter 
years (Municipal Corporation v. Madan Mohan, AIR 1976 43). 
A suit for eviction on reasonable requirement was compromised and the tenant 
was allowed to continue as tenant for the subsequent suit for ejectment on the 
ground of reasonable requirement, it was found that some reasonable requirement 
had been present during the earlier suit. The second suit was not maintainable. 
(2) The former suit has been decided—former suit means which is decided 
earlier. 
(3)  The said issue has been heard and finally decided. 
The issue or the suit itself is heard and finally decided, then it operates as res 
judicata and is not the reasons leading to the decision (Mysore State E. Board v. 
Bangalore W.C. & S. Mills, AIR 1963 SC 1128). However, no res judicata operates 
when the points could not have been raised in earlier suit. (See Prafulla Chandra v. 
Surat Roit AIR 1998 Ori. 41). But when a suit has been decided on merits, and the 
appeal is dismissed on a preliminary point, it amounts to the appeal being heard and 
finally decided and the decision operates as res judicata (Mukunda Jana v. Kanta 
Mandal, AIR 1979 NOC 116). 
(4)  Such former suit and the latter are between the same parties or litigation 
under the same title or persons claiming under parties above (Isher Singh v. Sarwan 
Singh, AIR 1965 SC 948). 
In short, this principle applies where an issue which has 
been raised in a subsequent suit was directly and 
substantially in issue in a former suit between the same 
parties and was heard and decided finally. Findings 
incidentally recorded do not operate as res judicata 
(Madhvi Amma Bhawani Amma v. Kunjikutty P.M. Pillai, AIR 
2000 SC 2301). 
Supreme Court in Gouri Naidu v. Thandrothu Bodemma and others, AIR 1997 
SC 808, held that the law is well settled that even if erroneous, an inter party 
judgement binds the party if the court of competent jurisdiction has decided the lis. 
Thus, a decision that a gift made by a coparceners is invalid under Hindu Law 
between coparceners, binds the parties when the same question is in issue in a 
subsequent suit between the same parties for partition. 
A consent or compromise decree is not a decision by Court. It is an acceptance 
of something to which the parties had agreed. The Court does not decide anything. 
The compromise degree merely has the seal of the Court on the agreement of the 
parties. As such, the principle of res judicata does not generally apply to a consent or 
compromise decree. But when the court on the facts proved comes to a conclusion 
that the parties intended that the consent decree should have the effect of deciding 
the question finally, the principle of res judicata may apply to it. 
The rule of res sub judice relates to a matter which is pending judicial enquiry 
EP-GCL-8 
348 
? 
while res Judicata relates to a matter adjudicated upon or a matter on which 
judgement has been pronounced. Res sub judice bars the trial of a suit in which the 
matter directly or substantially is pending adjudication in a previous suit, whereas rule 
of res judicata bars the trial of a suit of an issue in which the matter directly and 
substantially in issue has already been adjudicated upon in a previous suit between 
the same parties under the same title. Res Judicata arises out of considerations of 
public policy viz., that there should be an end to litigation on the same matter. Res-
Judicata presumes conclusively the truth of the former decision and ousts the 
jurisdiction of the Court to try the case. It is however essential that the matter directly 
and substantially in issue must be the same as in the former suit and not matters 
collaterally or incidentally in issue. 
An application for amendment of a decree is not a „suit‟ and may be entertained. 
But if such an application is heard and finally decided, then it will debar a subsequent 
application on general principles of law analogous to res judicata. However, dismissal 
of a suit for default, where there has been no adjudication on the merits of the 
application, will not operate as res judicata. Similarly an application for a review of 
judgment if refused does not bar a subsequent suit for the same relief on the same 
grounds. In the case of conflicting decrees, the last decree alone is the effective 
decree which can operate as res judicata. 
According to this provision of the Civil Procedure Code, no Court shall try any suit 
or issue in which the matter has been directly and substantially in issue in a former 
suit (i.e. suit previously decided) either between the same parties, or between parties 
under whom they or any of them claim, litigating under the same title in a Court 
competent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been 
subsequently raised an finally decided by such Court. 
According to Explanation to the Section, the expression „former‟ suit has been set 
out as stated above. The competence of a Court to decide an issue or suit is to be 
determined irrespective of any provisions as to a right of appeal from the decision of 
such Court. It is stated in Explanation III that the matter must have been alleged by 
one party and either denied or admitted expressly or impliedly by the other. 
Explanation IV any matter which might or ought to have been made a ground of 
defence or attack in such former suit shall be deemed to have been a matter directly 
and substantially in issue in such (former) suit.

Res Judicata in Section 11 of the Civil Procedure Code deals with bar or restraint on 
repetition of litigation of the same issues.

Constructive res judicata is the doctrine which has been provided for in 
Explanation IV (viz. matters or issues which could have been taken as ground of 
 
EP-GCL-8 
349 
? 
defence or attack in a former suit) as earlier referred to. This doctrine is based on the 
following grounds of public policy: 
 
(i) There should be an end to litigation; 
 (ii) The parties to a suit should not be harassed to agitate the same issues or 
matters already decided between them; 
 (iii) The time of Court should not be wasted over the matters that ought to have 
been and should have been decided in the former suit between the parties; 
 (iv) It is a rule of convenience and not a rule of absolute justice. 
Explanation V states that any relief claimed in the plaint but not expressly granted 
shall be deemed to have been refused. By Explanation VI it is provided that in the 
case of a representation suit or class of action all persons interested in any public or 
private right claimed in common for themselves and others are to be deemed to claim 
under the persons so litigating and res judicata shall apply to them. 
Explanations VII and VIII have been added by the Amendment Act of 1976. 
Explanation VII specifically lays down that the principles of res judicata apply to 
execution proceedings. The general pinciples of res judicata have been recognised in 
Explanation VIII. It provides that the decisions of a “Court of limited jurisdiction 
competent to decide such issue” operates as res judicata in a subsequent suit though 
the former Court had no jurisdiction to try the subsequent suit. The general principle 
of res judicata is wider in scope than Section 11 which is applied when a case does 
not come within four corners of Section 11. However, when the case falls under 
Section 11 but the conditions are not fulfilled, the general principles of res judicata 
cannot be resorted to. The conditions may be summarised as follows : 
Conditions of res judicata 
 
1. The matter must be directly and substantially in issue in two suits; 
 
2. The prior suit should be between the same parties or persons claiming under 
them; 
 
3. The parties should have litigated under the same title; 
 
4. The court which determined the earlier suit must be competent to try the 
latter suit; 
 
5. The same question is directly and substantially in issue in the latter suit. 
Bar to further suit 
Section 12 puts a bar to every suit where a plaintiff is precluded by rules from 
instituting a further suit in respect of any particular cause of action. Section comes 
into force only when a plaintiff is precluded by rules.

10.  SET-OFF COUNTER-CLAIM AND EQUITABLE SET-OFF 
Set-off 
Order 8, Rule 6 deals with set-off which is a reciprocal acquittal of debts between 
the plaintiff and defendant. It has the effect of extinguishing the plaintiff‟s claim to the 
extent of the amount claimed by the defendant as a counter claim. 
Under Order VIII Rule 6 where in a suit for the recovery of money the defendant 
claims to set off against the plaintiff‟s demand any ascertained sum of money legally 
recoverable by him from the plaintiff not exceeding the pecuniary jurisdiction of the 
Court and where both parties fill the same character as in the plaintiff‟s suit, the 
defendant may, at the first hearing of the suit, but not afterwords unless permitted by 
the Court, present a written statement containing the particulars of the debt sought to 
be set-off. 
Effect of Set-off 
Under clause (2) the written statement shall have the same effect as a plaint in a 
cross-suit so as to enable the Court to pronounce a final judgement in respect both of 
the original claim and of the set-off, but this shall not affect the lien, upon the amount 
decreed, of any pleader in respect of the costs payable to him under the decree. 
Counter-claim 
A defendant in a suit may, in addition to his right of pleading a set-off under Rule 
6, set up by way of counter-claim against the claim of the plaintiff, any right or claim in 
respect of a cause of action accruing to the defendant against the plaintiff either 
before or after the filling of the suit but before the defendant has delivered his 
defence or before the time limited for delivering his defence has expired, whether 
such counter-claim is in the nature of claim for damages or not. Such counter-claim 
must be within the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Court. (Order 8, Rule 6A) 
Equitable set-off 
Sometimes, the defendant is permitted to claim set-off in respect of an 
unascertained sum of money where the claim arises out of the same transaction, or 
transactions which can be considered as one transaction, or where there is 
knowledge on both sides of an existing debt due to one party and a credit by the 
other party found on and trusting to such debt as a means of discharging it. Generally 
the suits emerge from cross-demands in the same transaction and this doctrine is 
intended to save the defendant from having to take recourse to a separate cross-suit. 
In India distinction between legal and equitable set-off is recognised. Order 8, 
Rule 6 contains provisions as to legal set-off. Order 8, Rule 6A recognises the 
counter-claim by the defendant still an equitable set-off can be claimed independently 
of the Code. The Common Law Courts in England do not recognise equitable claims. 
11.  TEMPORARY INJUNCTIONS AND INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS 
Temporary injunction 
The Court may grant temporary injunction to restrain any such act (as set out 
below) or make such other order for the purpose of staying and preventing the 
wasting, damaging, alienation or sale or removal or disposition of the property or 
 
EP-GCL-8 
351 
? 
dispossession of the plaintiff, or otherwise causing injury to the plaintiff in relation to 
any property in dispute in the suit; where it is proved by affidavit or otherwise: 
 (a) that any property in dispute in a suit is in danger of being wasted, damaged 
or alienated by any party to the suit, or wrongfully sold in execution of a 
decree, or 
 (b) that the defendant threatens, or intends to remove or dispose of his property 
with a view to defrauding his creditors, or 
 (c) that the defendant threatens to dispossess the plaintiff or otherwise cause 
injury to the plaintiff in relation to any property in dispute in the suit. 
It would be necessary for the plaintiff to satisfy the Court that substantial and 
irreparable harm or injury would be suffered by him if such temporary injunction (till 
the disposal of the suit) is not granted and that such loss or damage or harm cannot 
be compensated by damages. (Order XXXIX) 
Interlocutory orders 
Power to order interim sale 
The Court may, on the application of any party to a suit order the sale, by any 
person named in such order, and in such manner and on such terms as it thinks fit, of 
any movable property, being the subject-matter of such suit, or attached before 
judgement in such suit, which is subject to speedy and natural decay, or which for 
any other just and sufficient cause it may be desirable to be sold at once. (Rule 6)

12. 
DETENTION, PRESERVATION, INSPECTION ETC. OF SUBJECT-MATTER 
OF SUIT 
The Court may, on application of any party to a suit, and on such terms as it 
thinks fit: 
 (a) make an order for the detention, preservation or inspection of any property 
which is the subject-matter of such suit or as to which any question may arise 
therein; 
 (b) for all or any of the purposes as in (a) above, authorise any person to enter 
upon or into any land or building in the possession of any other party to such 
suit; and 
 (c) for all or any of the purpose as in (a) above authorise any samples to be 
taken, or any observation to be made or experiment to be tried, which may 
EP-GCL-8 
352 
seem necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining full information or 
evidence. (Rule 7) 
Application for such order to be after notice— 
 (1) An application by the plaintiff for an order under Rule 6 or Rule 7 may be 
made at any time after institution of the suit. 
 (2) An application by the defendant for such an order may be made at any time 
after appearance. 
 (3) Before making an order under Rule 6 or Rule 7 on an application made for 
the purpose, the Court shall, except where it appears that the object of 
making such order would be defeated by the delay, direct notice thereof to be 
given to the opposite party. 
Deposit of money etc. in the Court 
Where the subject-matter of a suit is money or some other thing capable of 
delivery, and any party thereto admits that he holds such money or other thing as a 
trustee for another party, or that it belongs or is due to another party, the Court may 
order the same to be deposited in Court or delivered to such last-named party, with or 
without security subject to further direction of the Court. Rule (10) 
In any suit for restraining the defendant from committing a breach of contract or 
other injury of any kind, whether compensation is claimed or not, the plaintiff may, at 
any time after the commencement of the suit, and either before or after judgement, 
apply to the court for a temporary injunction to restrain the defendant from committing 
the breach of contract or injury complained of, or any breach of contract or injury of a 
like nature arising out of the same contract or relating to the same property or right. 
The Court may grant an injunction on such terms including keeping of an account and 
furnishing security etc. as it may think fit. 
The grant of a temporary injunction is a matter of discretion of Courts. Such 
injunction may be granted if the Court finds that there is a substantial question to be 
investigated and that matter should be preserved in status until final disposal of that 
question. In granting injunction, the Court has to see the balance of convenience and 
inconvenience of both sides. If the object of granting a temporary injunction is liable 
to be defeated by the delay, the Court while passing an order granting interim or 
temporary injunction, has a notice served on the defendant to show cause why the 
order granting the interim injunction should not be confirmed. On hearing the 
objection of the defendant to such injunction, the Court either confirms the interim 
injunction or cancels the order of injunction. 
13.  INSTITUTION OF SUIT 
Suit ordinarily is a civil action started by presenting a plaint in duplicate to the 
Court containing concise statement of the material facts, on which the party pleading 
relies for his claim or defence. In every plaint the facts must be proved by an affidavit. 
The main essentials of the suit are— 
 
(a) the opposing parties, 
 
(b) the cause of action, 
 
EP-GCL-8 
353 
 (c) the subject matter of the suit, and 
 (d) the relief(s) claimed. 
The plaint consists of a heading and title, the body of plaint and the relief(s) 
claimed. Every suit shall be instituted in the Court of the lowest grade competent to 
try it, as to be determined with regard to the subject matter being either immovable or 
movable property or to the place of abode or of business or the defendant. A suit for 
a tort may be brought either where the wrong was committed or where the defendant 
resides or carries on business. A suit for a breach of contract may be instituted in a 
Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the defendant or each of the 
defendants (where there are more than one) at the time of commencement of the suit 
actually or voluntarily resides or carries on business or personally works for gain, or 
where any of the defendants so resides or works for gain or carries on business 
provided the leave of the Court is given or that the other defendants acquiesce in 
such situation. A suit for breach of contract may also be instituted where the cause of 
action arises that is, where the contract was made or where the breach was 
committed. A suit for recovery of immovable property can be instituted in a Court 
within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the property or any property of it is situate. 
Claim for recovery of any immovable property could be for (a) mesne profits or 
arrear‟s of rent, (b) damages for breach of contract under which the property or any 
part thereof is held and (c) claims in which the relief sought is based on the same 
cause of action. 
Where a plaintiff omits to sue in respect of or intentionally relinquishes any 
portion of his claim, he shall not afterwards sue in respect of the portion so omitted or 
relinquished. 
Regarding other suits, they shall be instituted in a Court within the local limits of 
whose jurisdiction: 
 (a) the defendant or each of the defendants if there are more than one at the 
time of the commencement of the suit actually or voluntarily resides or carries 
on business or personally works for gain or 
 (b) any of the defendants, where there are more than one at the time of the 
commencement of the suit, actually or voluntarily resides, or carries on 
business, or personally works for gain, provided that in such case either the 
leave of the Court is given or the defendants who do not reside or carry on 
business, or personally work for gain, as aforesaid, acquiesce in such 
institution; or 
 (c) the cause of action wholly or in part arises. 
Misjoinder of Parties — Where more than one persons joined in one suit as 
plaintiffs  or  defendants  in  whom  or  against  whom  any  right to relief does not 
arise or against whom separate suits are brought, no common question of law or fact 
would arise, it is a case of „misjoinder of parties‟. To avoid such misjoinder, two 
factors are essential viz. (i) the right to relief must arise out of the same act or 
transaction brought by the plaintiffs or against the defendants, (ii) there is a common 
question of law or fact. The Code does not require that all the questions of law or of 
fact should be common to all the parties. It is sufficient that if there is one common 
question. 
EP-GCL-8 
354 
? 
"Cause of action" means every fact which, if traversed, would be necessary for 
the plaintiff to prove in order to support his right to the judgement of the Court. Thus, 
cause of action is a bundle of essential facts which the plaintiff has to prove in order 
to sustain his action. The cause of action must be antecedent to the institution of the 
suit. It consists of two factors (a) a right, and (b) an infringement for which relief is 
claimed. 
Every breach of contract gives rise to a cause of action and a suit may be 
instituted to secure the proper relief in the place— 
 (a) where the contract was made, or 
 (b) where the breach has occurred, or 
 (c) the place where money is payable. 
The place of breach is the place where the contract had to be performed or 
completed. 
Where the place of payment is not specified, it is to be ascertained with reference 
to the intention of the parties and the circumstances of each case. 
Misjoinder of Causes of Action — If the plaintiffs are not jointly interested in all 
the causes of action there is misjoinder of causes of action. 
All objections regarding misjoinder of parties or of cause of action should be 
taken at the first hearing of the suit and before the settlement of causes unless the 
ground for objections had subsequently arisen.

14.  IMPORTANT STAGES IN PROCEEDINGS OF A SUIT 
When the suit has been duly instituted, the Court issues an order (known as 
summons) to the defendant to appear and answer the claim and to file the written 
statement of his defence if any within a period of 30 days from the date of service of 
summons. No summons are to be issued when the defendant has appeared at the 
presentation of plaint and admitted the plaintiffs claim. 
If the defendant fails to file the written statement within the prescribed 
period of 30 days, he is allowed to file the same on such other days as 
 
EP-GCL-8 
355 
specified by the Court for reasons to be recorded in writing but not later 
than ninety days from the date of service of summons (Order 8, R1). 
Provision though negatively worded is procedural. It does not deal with 
power of court or provide consequences of non-extension of time. The 
provision can therefore be read as directory. (Shaikh Salim Haji Abdul 
Khayumsab v. Kumar & Ors, AIR 2006 SC 398. 
The defendant may appear in person or by a duly instructed pleader or by a 
pleader accompanied by some person to be able to answer all material questions 
relating to the suit. 
Every summons  must be signed by the judge or an authorised officer of the 
Court and sealed with the seal of the Court and be accompanied by a copy of the 
plaint. (Order 5) 
If the requirement of personal appearance of the defendant or plaintiff is felt by 
the Court, then it has to make an order for such appearance. The summons must 
contain a direction that it is for the settlement of issues only or for the final disposal of 
the suit. Every summons must be accompanied by a copy of the plaint. Where no 
date is fixed for the appearance of the defendant, the Court has no power to dismiss 
the suit in default. The summons must also state that the defendant is to produce all 
documents in his possession or power upon which he intends to rely in support of his 
case. 
The ordinary mode of service of summons i.e. direct service is by delivery or 
tendering a copy of it signed by the judge or competent officer of the Court to the 
person summoned either personally or to his agent or any adult male or female 
member of his family, against signature obtained in acknowledgement of the 
services. 
15.  DELIVERY OF SUMMONS BY COURT 
Rule 9 substituted by the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2002 
provides that— 
(1) Where the defendant resides within the jurisdiction of the Court in which the 
suit is instituted, or has an agent resident within that jurisdiction who is empowered to 
accept the service of the summons, the summons shall, unless the Court otherwise 
directs, be delivered or sent either to the proper officer, who may be an officer of a 
Court other than that in which the suit is instituted, to be served by him or one of his 
subordinates or to such courier services as are approved by the Court. 
(2) The services of summons may be made by delivering or transmitting a copy 
thereof by registered post acknowledgement due, addressed to the defendant or his 
agent empowered to accept the service or by speed post or by such courier services 
as are approved by the High Court or by the Court referred to in sub-rule (1) or by 
any other means to transmission of documents (including fax message or electronic 
mail service) provided by the rules made by the High Court. 
Provided that the service of summons under this sub-rule shall be made at the 
expenses of the plaintiff. 
EP-GCL-8 
356 
(3) Where the defendant resides outside the jurisdiction of the Court in which the 
suit is instituted, and the Court directs that the service of summons on that defendant 
may be made by such mode of service of summons as is referred to in sub-rule (3) 
(except by registered post acknowledgement due), the provisions of rule 21 shall not 
apply. 
(4) When an acknowledgement or any other receipt purporting to be signed by 
the defendant or his agent is received by the Court or postal article containing the 
summons is received back by the Court with an endorsement purporting to have 
been made by a postal employee or by any person authorised by the courier service 
to the effect that the defendant or his agent had refused to take delivery of the postal 
article containing the summons or had refused to accept the summons by any other 
means specified in sub-rule (3) when tendered or transmitted to him, the Court 
issuing the summons shall declare that the summons had been duly served on the 
defendant: 
Provided that where the summons was properly addressed, pre-paid and duly 
sent by registered post acknowledgement due, the declaration referred to in this sub-
rule shall be made notwithstanding the fact that the acknowledgement having been 
lost or mislaid, or for any other reason, has not been received by the Court within 
thirty days from the date of issue of summons. 
Where the Court is satisfied that there is reason to believe that the person 
summoned is keeping out of the way for the purpose of avoiding service or that for 
any other reason the summons cannot be served in the ordinary way the Court shall 
order the service of the summons to be served by affixing a copy thereof in some 
conspicuous place in the Court house and also upon some conspicuous part of the 
house in which the person summoned is known to have last resided or carried on 
business or personally worked for gain, or in such other manner as the Court thinks 
fit. (O.5, R.20, „substituted service‟) 
Where defendant resides in another province, a summons may be sent for 
service in another state to such court and in such manner as may be prescribed by 
rules in force in that State. 
The above provisions shall apply to summons to witnesses. 
In the case of a defendant who is a public officer, servant of railways or local 
authority, the Court may, if more convenient, send the summons to the head of the 
office in which he is employed. In the case of a suit being instituted against a 
corporation, the summons may be served (a) on the secretary or on any director, or 
other principal officer of the corporation or (b) by leaving it or sending it by post 
addressed to the corporation at the registered office or if there is no registered office, 
then at the place where the corporation carries on business. (O.29, R.2) 
Where persons are to be sued as partners in the name of their firm, the 
summons shall be served either (a) upon one or more of the partners or (b) at the 
principal place at which the partnership business is carried on within India or upon 
any person having the control or management of the partnership business. Where a 
partnership has been dissolved the summons shall be served upon every person 
whom it is sought to make liable.

Defence — The defendant has to file a written statement of his defence within a 
period of thirty days from the date of service of summons. If he fails to file the written 
statement within the stipulated time period he is allowed to file the same on such 
other day as may be specified by the Court for reasons to be recorded in writing. The 
time period for filing the written statement should not exceed 90 days. 
Where the defendant bases his defence upon a document or relies upon any 
document in his possession in support of his defence or claim for set-off or counter 
claim, he has to enter such document in a list and produce it in Court while 
presenting his written statement and deliver the document and a copy thereof to be 
filed within the written statement. 
Any document which ought to be produced in the Court but is not so produced, 
such document shall not be received in evidence at the time of hearing of the suit 
without the leave of the Court (O.8, R.1 and 1A). However this rule does not apply to 
documents produced for the cross-examination of the plaintiff witnesses or handover 
to a witness merely to refresh his memory. 
Besides, particulars of set-off must be given in the written statement. A plea of 
set-off is set up when the defendant pleads liability of the plaintiff to pay to him, in 
defence in a suit by the plaintiff for recovery of money. Any right of counter claim 
must be stated. In the written statement new facts must be specifically pleaded. The 
defendant must deal specifically with each allegation of fact of which he does not 
admit the truth. An evasive denial is not permissible and all allegations of facts not 
denied specifically or by necessary implication shall be taken to be admitted. 
Appearance of parties and consequence of non-appearance — If both the parties 
do not appear when the suit is called on for hearing, the Court may make an order 
that the suit be dismissed (O.9, R. 3 and 4). If the defendant is absent in spite of 
service of summons and the plaintiff appears, the Court may proceed ex-parte. 
In case the defendant is not served with summons, the Court shall order a 
second summon to be issued. If the summons is served on the defendant without 
sufficient time to appear, the Court may postpone the hearing to a further date. If the 
summon was not served on the defendant in sufficient time due to the plaintiff‟s 
default, the Court shall order the plaintiff to pay costs of adjournment. Where the 
hearing of the suit is adjourned ex-parte and the defendant appears at or before such 
hearing and assigns a good cause for his previous non-appearance, the defendant 
may be heard in answer to the suit on such terms as to costs or otherwise. 
EP-GCL-8 
358 
The defendant is not precluded from taking part in the proceedings even though 
he may not be allowed to file a written statement. If the plaintiff is absent and the 
defendant is present at the hearing of the suit, the Court shall make an order for the 
dismissal of the suit, unless the defendant admits the claim of the plaintiff or a part 
thereof in which case the Court shall pass a decree in favour of the plaintiff in 
accordance with the admission of the defendant and shall dismiss the suit to the 
extent of the remainder (O.9, R.8). 
In any case in which a decree is passed ex-parte against a defendant he may 
apply for setting aside the decree on the ground that the summons was not duly 
served on him or that he was prevented by any sufficient cause from appearing when 
the suit was called on for hearing and the Court shall set aside the decree on such 
terms as to costs payment into Court or otherwise as it deems proper and shall 
appoint a day for proceeding with the suit (O.9, R.13). 
A defendant has four remedies available if an ex-parte decree is passed against 
him : 
 
(i) He may file an appeal against the ex-parte decree under Section 96 of the 
C.P.C. 
 (ii) He may file an application for review of the judgement. (O.47, R.1) 
 (iii) He may apply for setting aside the ex-parte decree. 
 (iv) A suit can also be filed to set aside an ex-parte decree obtained by fraud but 
no suit shall lie for non-service of summons. 
It is open to a party at the trial of a suit to use in evidence any one or more of the 
answers or any part of the answer of the opposite party to interrogatories without 
putting in the others or the whole of such answers. But the court may direct that any 
connected answer should also be put in. 
Discovery and interrogatories and production of documents 
"Discovery" means finding out material facts and documents from an adversary in 
order to know and ascertain the nature of the case or in order to support his own 
case or in order to narrow the points at issue or to avoid proving admitted facts. 
Discovery may be of two kinds — (a) by interrogatories (b) by documents. 
The objects of discovery are to: 
 (a) ascertain the nature of the case of the adversary or material facts for the 
adversary‟s case. 
 (b) obtain admissions of the adversary for supporting the party‟s own case or 
indirectly by impeaching or destroying the adversary‟s case. 
 (c) narrow the points at issue. 
 (d) avoid expense and effort in proving admitted facts. 
Discovery by interrogations — Any party to a suit, by leave of the Court, may 
deliver interrogatories in writing for the examination of the opposite parties. But 
interrogatories will not be allowed for the following purposes : 
 
(i) for obtaining discovery of facts which relates exclusively to the evidence of 
the adversary‟s case or title. 
 
EP-GCL-8 
359 
 (ii) to interrogate any confidential communications between the adversary and 
his counsel. 
 (iii) to obtain disclosures injurious to public interests. 
 (iv) interrogatories that are of a „fishing‟ nature i.e. which do not relate to some 
definite and existing state of circumstances but are resorted to in a 
speculative manner to discover something which may help a party making 
the interrogatories. 
Discovery by documents — All documents relating to the matters in issue in the 
possession or power of any adversary can be inspected by means of discovery by 
documents. Any party may apply to the Court for an order directing any other party to 
the suit to make discovery on oath the documents which are or which have been in 
his possession or powers relating to any matter in question. The Court may on 
hearing the application either refuse or adjourn it, if it is satisfied that such discovery 
is not necessary at all or not necessary at the stage. Or if it thinks fit in its discretion, 
it may make order for discovery limited to certain classes of documents. 
Every party to a suit may give notice to the other party at or before the settlement 
of issues to produce for his inspection any document referred to in the pleadings or 
affidavits of the other party. If the other party refuses to comply with this order he 
shall not be allowed to put any such document in evidence (O.11, R.15), unless he 
satisfies the Court that such document relates only to his own title, he being a 
defendant to the suit or any other ground accepted by the Court. Documents not 
referred to in the pleadings or affidavits may be inspected by a party if the Court 
allows (O.11, R.18). 
A party may refuse to produce the document for inspection on the following 
grounds: 
 
(i) where it discloses a party‟s evidence 
 (ii) when it enjoys a legal professional privilege 
 (iii) when it is injurious to public interest 
 (iv) denial of possession of document. 
If a party denies by an affidavit the possession of any document, the party 
claiming discovery cannot cross-examine upon it, nor adduce evidence to contradict 
it, because in all questions of discovery the oath of the party making the discovery is 
conclusive (Kedarnath v. Vishwanath, (1924) 46 All. 417). 
Admission by parties — "Admission" means that one party accepts the case of 
the other party in whole or in part to be true. Admission may be either in pleadings or 
by answers to interrogatories, by agreement of the parties or admission by notice. 
Issues — Issues arise when a material proposition of fact or law is affirmed by 
one party and denied by the other. Issues may be either of fact or of law. 
It is incumbent on the Court at the first hearing of the suit after reading the plaint 
and the written statement and after ascertaining and examination of the parties if 
necessary regarding the material propositions of law and facts, to frame the issues 
thereon for decision of the case. Where the Court is of the opinion that the suit can be 
disposed off on issues of law only, it shall try those issues first and postpone the 
EP-GCL-8 
360 
? 
framing of the other issues until after that issue has been determined and may deal 
with the suit in accordance with the decision of that issue. 
Issues are to be framed on material proportions of fact or law which are to be 
gathered from the following— 
 
(i) Allegations made in the plaint and written statement, 
 (ii) Allegations made by the parties or persons present on their behalf or their 
pleaders on oath, 
 (iii) Allegations in answer to interrogatories, 
 (iv) Contents of documents produced by the parties, 
 (v) Statements made by parties or their representatives when examined, 
 (vi) From examination of a witness or any documents ordered to be produced. 
Hearing of the suit — The plaintiff has the right to begin unless the defendant 
admits the fact alleged by the plaintiff and contends that either in point of law or on 
some additional facts alleged by the defendant, the plaintiff is not entitled to any part 
of the relief sought by him and in such a case the defendant has a right to begin 
(O.18, R.1). Where there are several issues, the burden of proving some of which lies 
on the other party, the party beginning has an option to produce his evidence on 
those issues or reserve it by way of an answer to the evidence produced by the other 
party, and in the latter case, the party beginning may produce evidence on those 
issues after the other party has produced all his evidence. Care must be taken that 
no part of the evidence should be produced on those issues for which the plaintiff 
reserves a right to produce evidence after the defence has closed his evidence, 
otherwise the plaintiff shall lose his right of reserving evidence (O.18, R.3).

Affidavit — An affidavit is a written statement of the deponent on oath duly 
affirmed before any Court or Magistrate or any Oath Commissioner appointed by the 
Court or before the Notary Public. An affidavit can be used in the following cases: 
 
(i) the Court may at any time of its own motion or on application of any party 
order that any fact may be proved by affidavits (Section 30). 
 (ii) the Court may at any time order that the affidavit of any witness may be read 
at the hearing unless either party bona-fide desires to cross-examine him and 
he can be produced (O.19, R.1). 
 
EP-GCL-8 
361 
 (iii) upon application by a party, evidence of a witness may be given on affidavit, 
but the court may at the instance of either party, order the deponent to attend 
the court for cross-examination unless he is exempted from personal 
appearance. Affidavits are confined to such facts as the deponent is able of 
his own knowledge to prove except on interlocutory applications. (O.19, 
R.2&3). 
Judgement — The Court after the case has been heard shall pronounce 
judgement in an open court either at once or on some future day as may be fixed by 
the court for that purpose of which due notice shall be given to the parties or their 
pleaders (Order XX, Rule 1). The proper object of a judgement is to support by the 
most cogent reasons that suggest themselves final conclusion at which the judge has 
conscientiously arrived. 
If the judgement is not pronounced at once every endeavour shall be made by 
the Court to pronounce the judgement within a period of 30 days from the date on 
which the hearing of the case was concluded. However, if it is not practicable to do so 
on the ground of exceptional and extra ordinary circumstances of the case, the Court 
must fix a future day which should not be a day beyond sixty days for the 
pronouncement of the judgement giving due notice of the day so fixed to the 
concerned parties. In Kanhaiyalal v. Anup Kumar, AIR 2003 SC 689, where the 
High Court pronounced the judgment after two years and six months, the 
judgment was set aside by the Supreme Court observing that it would not be 
proper for a Court to sit tied over the matter for such a long period. 
Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the above mentioned case, the 
Gujarat High Court in Ramkishan Guru Mandir v. Ramavtar Bansraj, AIR 2006 
Guj. 34, set aside the judgment which was passed after two and a half years 
after conclusion of arguments holding that where a judgment was delivered 
after two years or more, public at large would have reasons to say bad about 
the Court and the judges. 
The judgement must be dated and signed by the judge. Once the judgement is 
signed it can not afterwords be altered or added to except as provided under Section 
152 or on review. 
It is a substantial objection to a judgement that it does not dispose of the question 
as it was presented by the parties (Reghunatha v. Sri Brozo Kishoro, (1876) 3 I.A., 
154). 
If a judgement is unintelligible, the appellate court may set it aside and 
remand the case to the lower court for the recording of judgement according to 
law after hearing afresh the arguments of the pleaders (Harbhagwan v. Ahmad, 
AIR 1922 Lah. 122). 
Decree 
On judgement a decree follows. Every endeavour must be made to ensure that 
decree is drawn up expeditiously and in any case within a period of 15 days from the 
date on which the judgement is pronounced. It should contain the: 
 
(i) number of the suit(s);  
EP-GCL-8 
362 
 (ii) names and descriptions of the parties and their registered addresses;  
 (iii) particulars of the claim;  
 (iv) relief granted or other determination of the suit;  
 (v) amount of cost incurred and by whom is to be paid. 
Execution 
Execution is the enforcement of decrees or orders of the Court. A decree may be 
executed either by the Court which passed it or by the Court to which it is sent for 
execution. (Section 36. For details refer Order 21) 
16.  APPEALS 
Right of appeal is not a natural or inherent right attached to litigation. Such a right 
is given by the statute or by rules having the force of statute (Rangoon Botatoung 
Company v. The Collector, Rangoon, 39 I.A. 197). 
There are four kinds of appeals provided under the Civil Procedure Code: 
 
(i) Appeals from original Decrees (Sections 96-99-Order 41) 
 (ii) Second Appeals (Sections 100-103-Order 42) 
 (iii) Appeals from Orders (Sections 104-106, 0.43 r. 1-2) 
 (iv) Appeals to the Supreme Court (Sections 109 and 112, Order 45) 
Appeals from original decrees may be preferred in the Court 
superior to the Court passing the decree. An appeal may lie from 
an original decree passed ex parte. Where the decree has been 
passed with the consent of parties, no appeal lies. The appeal 
from original decree lies on a question of law. No appeal lies in any suit of the 
nature cognizable by Courts of small causes when the amount or value of the 
subject matter of the original suit does not exceed ten thousand rupees. 
Second appeal: As per Section 100 of the Civil Procedure Code, an appeal lies to 
the High Court from every decree passed in appeal by any subordinate Court if the 
High Court is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law. Under this 
Section, an appeal may lie from an appellate decree passed ex parte. 
The memorandum of appeal must precisely state the substantial question of law 
involved in the appeal. If the High Court is satisfied that a substantial question of law 
is involved, such question shall be formulated by it and the appeal is to be heard on 
the question so formulated. The respondent is allowed to argue that the case does 
not involve such question. The High Court is empowered to hear the appeal on any 
other substantial question of law not formulated by it if it is satisfied that the case 
involves such question. 
The High Court is not to vary or reverse any order or decree except the order which 
if made in favour of the party applying for revision would have finally disposed of the 
suit or proceedings or against which an appeal lies either to the High Court or any 
subordinate Court. A revision shall not operate as a stay suit or other proceeding before 
the Court except where such suit or other proceeding is stayed by the High Court. 
 
 
EP-GCL-8 
363 
As a general rule the second appeal is on questions of law alone (Section 100). 
The Privy Council in Durga Choudharain v. Jawaher Singh, 
(1891) 18 Cal. 23 P.C., observed that there is no jurisdiction 
to entertain a second appeal on the ground of an erroneous 
finding of fact, however gross or inexcusable the error may 
seem to be... where there is no error or defect in procedure, 
the finding of the first appellate Court upon a question of 
fact is final, if that Court had before it evidence proper for its 
consideration in support of the finding. 
Appeal from orders would lie only from the following orders on grounds of defect 
or irregularity in law— 
 
(i) an order under Section 35A of the Code allowing special costs, and order 
under Section 91 or Section 92 refusing leave to Institute a suit of the nature 
referred to in Section 91 or Section 92, 
 (ii) an order under Section 95 for compensation for obtaining attachment or 
injunction on insufficient ground, 
 (iii) an order under the Code imposing a fine or directing the detention or arrest 
of any person except in execution of a decree. 
 (iv) appealable orders as set out under Order 43, R.1. 
However no appeal shall lie from following orders— 
 
(i) any order specified in clause (a) and 
 (ii) from any order passed in appeal under Section 100. 
Appeals to the Supreme Court would lie in the following cases: 
 
(i) from any decree or order of Civil Court when the case is certified by the Court 
deciding it to be fit for appeal to the Supreme Court or when special leave is 
granted under Section 112 by the Supreme Court itself, 
 (ii) from any judgement, decree or final order passed on appeal by a High Court 
or by any other court of final appellate jurisdiction, 
 (iii) from any judgement, decree or final orders passed by a High Court in 
exercise of original civil jurisdiction. 
The general rule is that the parties to an appeal shall not be entitled to produce 
additional evidence whether oral or documentary. But the appellate court has a 
discretion to allow additional evidence in the following circumstances: 
 
(i) When the lower court has refused to admit evidence which ought to have 
been admitted. 
 (ii) The appellate court requires any document to be produced or any witness to 
be examined to enable it to pronounce judgement. 
 (iii) for any other substantial cause. 
but in all such cases the appellate court shall record its reasons for admission of 
additional evidence. 
EP-GCL-8

? 
The essential factors to be stated in an appellate judgement are (a) the points for 
determination, (b) the decision thereon, (c) the reasons for the decision, and (d) 
where the decree appealed from is reversed or varied, the relief to which the 
appellant is entitled (O.41, R.31). 
The judgement shall be signed and dated by the judge or judges concurring 
therein.

17.  REFERENCE, REVIEW AND REVISION 
Reference to High Court 
Subject to such conditions as may be prescribed, at any time before judgement a 
court in which a suit has been instituted may state a case and refer the same for 
opinion of the High Court and the High Court may make such order thereon as it 
thinks fit. (Section 113 Also refer to Rule 1 of Order 46). 
Review 
The right of review has been conferred by Section 114 and Order 47 Rule 1 of 
the Code. It provides that any person considering himself aggrieved by a decree or 
order may apply for a review of judgement to the court which passed the decree or 
made the order on any of the grounds as mentioned in Order 47 Rule 1, namely— 
 
(i) discovery by the applicant of new and important matter or evidence which, 
after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could not 
be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or order made, 
or 
 (ii) on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or 
 (iii) for any other sufficient reason, 
and the Court may make such order thereon as it thinks fit. 
Revision 
Section 115 deals with revision. The High Court may call for the record of any 
case which has been decided by any Court subordinate to such High Court and in 
which no appeal lies thereto, and if such subordinate Court appears— 
 
(i) to have exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it by law, or 
 
EP-GCL-8 
365 
? 
 (ii) to have failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested, or 
 (iii) to have acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with material 
irregularity, 
the High Court may make such order as it thinks fit. 
Provided that the High Court shall not vary or reverse any order made or any 
order deciding an issue in the course of a suit or proceeding except where the order, 
if it had been made in favour of the party applying for revision would have finally 
disposed of the suit or other proceedings. 
The High Court shall not vary or reverse any decree or order against which an 
appeal lies either to the High Court or any Court subordinate thereto. 
A revision shall not operate as a stay of suit or other proceeding before the Court 
except where such suit or proceeding is stayed by the High Court. 
18.  SUITS BY OR AGAINST A CORPORATION 
Signature or verification of pleading 
In suits by or against a corporation, any pleading may be signed and verified on 
behalf of the corporation, by the secretary or by any director or other principal officer 
of the corporation who is able to depose to the facts of the case. (O.29, R.1) 
Service of summons 
Subject to any provision regulating service of process, where the suit is against a 
corporation, the summons may be served: 
 (a) on the secretary or any director or other principal officer of the corporation, or 
 (b) by leaving it or sending it by post addressed to the corporation at the 
registered office or if there is no registered office then at the place where the 
corporation carries on business. (O.29, R. 2) 
Power of the Court to require personal attendance 
The Court may at any stage of the suit, require the personal appearance of the 
secretary or any director, or other principal officer of the corporation who may be able 
to answer material questions relating to the suit. (O.29, R.3)

19.  SUITS BY OR AGAINST MINORS 
A minor is a person (i) who has not completed the age of 18 years and (ii) for 
whose person or property a guardian has been appointed by a Court, for whose 
property is under a Court of Wards, the age of majority is completed at the age of 21 
years. 
Every suit by a minor shall be instituted in his name by a person who in such suit 
shall be called the next friend of the minor. The next friend should be a person who is 
of sound mind and has attained majority. However, the interest of such person is not 
adverse to that of the minor and that he is not in the case of a next friend, a 
defendant for the suit. (O.32, Rules 1 and 4). 
Where the suit is instituted without a next friend, the defendant may apply to have 
the plaint taken off the file, with costs to be paid by the pleader or other person by 
whom it was presented. (O.32, R.2). 
Where the defendant is a minor the Court, on being satisfied of the fact of his 
minority, shall appoint a proper person to be guardian for the suit for such minor 
[O.32, R.3(1)].  An order for the appointment of a guardian for the suit may be 
obtained upon application in the name and on behalf of the minor or by the plaintiff 
[O.32, R.3(2)]. 
A person appointed as guardian for the suit for a minor shall, unless his 
appointment is terminated by retirement, removal or death, continues as such 
throughout all proceeding arising out of the suit including proceedings in any 
appellate or revisional court and any proceedings in the execution of a decree. [O.32, 
R.3(5)] 
When minor attain majority — When the minor plaintiff attains majority he may 
elect to proceed with the suit or application or elect to abandon it. If he elects the 
former course, he shall apply for an order discharging the next frined and for leave to 
proceed in his own name and the title of the suit will be corrected. If he elects to 
abandon the suit or application, he shall, if a sole plaintiff or sole applicant apply for 
an order to dismiss the suit on repayment of the costs incurred by the defendant or 
opposite party etc. (For details see Rules 12 and 13 - Order 32) 
20.  SUMMARY PROCEDURE 
A procedure by way of summary suit applies to suits upon bill of exchange, 
hundies or promissory notes, when the plaintiff desires to proceed under the 
provisions of Order 37. Order 37 provides for a summary procedure in respect of 
certain suits. The object is to prevent unreasonable obstruction by a defendant. 
(Order 37) 
The rules for summary procedure are applicable to the following Courts: 
 (1) High Courts, City Civil Courts and Small Courts; 
 (2) Other Courts: In such Courts the High Courts may restrict the operation of 
order 37 by issuing a notification in the Official Gazette. 
The debt or liquidated demand in money payable by the defendant should arise 
on a written contract or on an enactment or on a guarantee. 
 
EP-GCL-8 
367 
? 
Institution of summary suits 
Such suit may be instituted by presenting a plaint containing the following 
essentials: 
 (1) a specific averment to the effect that the suit is filed under this order; 
 (2) that no relief which does not fall within the ambit of this rule has been 
claimed; 
 (3) the inscription immediately below the number of the suit in the title of the suit 
that the suit is being established under Order 37 of the CPC. 
Leave to defend 
Order 37 rule 3 prescribe the mode of service of summons etc. and leave to 
defend. The defendant is not entitled to defend the suit unless he enters an 
appearance within 10 days from the service of summons. Such leave to defend may 
be granted unconditional or upon such term as the Court or the Judge may think fit. 
However, such leave shall not be granted where: 
 (1) the Court is satisfied that the facts disclosed by the defendant do not indicate 
that he has a substantial defence or that the defences are frivolous or 
veracious, and 
 (2) the part of the amount claimed by the plaintiff and admitted by the defendant 
to be due from him is deposited by him in the Court. 
On the hearing of such summon for judgement, the plaintiff shall be entitled to 
judgement provided the defendant has not applied for leave to defend or if such 
application has been made and is refused or where the defendant is permitted to 
defend but he fails to give the required security within the prescribed time or to carry 
out such other precautions as may have been directed by the Court. 
After decree, the Court may, under special circumstances set-aside the decree 
and if necessary stay or set-aside execution, and may give leave to the defendant to 
appear and to defend the suit. (Rule 4 order 37) 
The summary suit must be brought within one year from the date on which the 
debt becomes due and payable, whereas the period of limitation for suits for ordinary 
cases under negotiable instrument is three years.

LESSON ROUND-UP 
 
 
The Civil Procedure Code consists of two parts. 158 Sections form the first part 
and the rules and orders contained in Schedule I form the second part. The 
object of the Code generally is to create jurisdiction while the rules indicate the 
mode in which the jurisdiction should be exercised. 
 
The Code defines important terms that have been used thereunder and deals 
with different types of courts and their jurisdiction. Jurisdiction means the 
authority by which a Court has to decide matters that are brought before it for 
adjudication. 
 
Under the Code of Civil Procedure, a civil court has jurisdiction to try a suit if two 
conditions are fulfilled: (i) the suit must be of a civil nature; and (ii) the cognizance 
of such suit should not have been barred. Jurisdiction of a court may be of four 
kinds: jurisdiction over the subject matter; local or territorial jurisdiction; original 
and appellate jurisdiction; pecuniary jurisdiction depending on pecuniary value of 
the suit. 
 
Section 10 deals with stay of civil suits. The object of the rule contained in 
Section 10 is to prevent courts of concurrent jurisdiction from simultaneously 
entertaining and adjudicating upon two parallel suits in respect of same matter in 
issue. The section intends to protect a person from multiplicity of proceedings 
and to avoid a conflict of decisions. 
 
The Code embodies the doctrine of res judicata that is, bar or restraint on 
repetition of litigation of the same issues. It enacts that since a matter is finally 
decided by a competent court, no party can be permitted to reopen it in a 
subsequent litigaton. It is pragmatic principle accepted and provided in law that 
there must be a limit or end to litigation on the same issues. In the absence of 
such a rule there would be no end to litigation and the parties would be put to 
constant trouble, harassment and expenses. 
 
In any suit for restraining the defendant from committing a breach of contract or 
other injury of any kind, whether compensation is claimed or not, the plaintiff may, 
at any time after the commencement of the suit, and either before or after 
judgement, apply to the court for a temporary injunction to restrain the defendant 
from committing the breach of contract or injury complained of, or any breach of 
contract or injury of a like nature arising out of the same contract or relating to the 
same property or right. The Court may grant an injunction on such terms 
including keeping of an account and furnishing security, etc. as it may think fit. 
 
The grant of a temporary injunction is a matter of discretion of Courts. Such 
injunction may be granted if the Court finds that there is a substantial question to 
be investigated and that matter should be preserved in status until final disposal 
of that question. 
 
EP-GCL-8 
369 
 
The Code also provides for making certain interlocutory orders. The court has 
power to order sale of any moveable property which is the subject-matter of the 
suit or attached before judgement in such suit which is subject to speedy and 
natural decay or for any just and sufficient cause desirable to be sold at once. 
 
It can also order for detention, preservation or inspection of any property which is 
the subject-matter of such suit, or as to which any question may arise therein. 
And for that purpose it can authorise any person to enter upon or into any land or 
building in the possession of any other party to such suit or authorise any 
samples to be taken or observation to be made or experiment to be tried for the 
purpose of obtaining full information. 
 
Suit ordinarily is a civil action started by presenting a plaint in duplicate to the 
Court containing concise statement of the material facts, on which the party 
pleading relies for his claim or defence. In every plaint the facts must be proved 
by an affidavit. 
 
The main essentials of the suit are: (i) the opposing parties; (ii) the cause of 
action; (iii) the subject matter of the suit, and (iv) the relief(s) claimed. 
 
Every suit shall be instituted in the Court of the lowest grade to try it. The Code 
specifies the categories of suits that shall be instituted in the court within the local 
limits of whose jurisdiction the property is situated. This is subject to the 
pecuniary or other limitations prescribed by any law. The various stages in 
proceedings of a suit have been elaborately laid down under the Code. 
 
It also lays down provisions relating to appeals, reference, review and revision. 
Any person who feels aggrieved by any decree or order passed by the court may 
prefer an appeal in a superior court if an appeal is provided against that decree 
or order or may make an application for review or revision. In certain cases, a 
subordinate court may make a reference to a High Court. 
 
A procedure by way of summary suit applies to suits upon bill of exchange, 
hundies or promissory notes, when the plaintiff desires to proceed under the 
provisions of Order 37. Order 37 provides for a summary procedure in respect of 
certain suits. The object is to prevent unreasonable obstruction by a defendant. 
The summary suit must be brought within one year from the date on which the 
debt becomes due and payable, whereas the period of limitation for suits for 
ordinary cases under negotiable instrument is three years.

STUDY IX 
THE CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE, 1973 
  
 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Criminal law occupies a pre-dominant place among the agencies of social control and 
is regarded as a formidable weapon that society has forged to protect itself against 
anti-social behaviour. The law of criminal procedure is intended to provide a 
mechanism for the enforcement of criminal law. Without the proper procedural law the 
substantive criminal law which defines offences and provides punishment for them 
would be almost worthless. The objective of this lesson is to impart knowledge to the 
students so that they develop proper perspective about the important provisions of the 
criminal procedure.  At the end of the Study Lesson you should be able to understand

1.  INTRODUCTION 
The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Cr. P.C.) was repealed by the Code of 
1973 enacted by Parliament on 25th January, 1974 and made effective from 1.4.1974 
so as to consolidate and amend the law relating to Criminal Procedure. Company 
Secretaries and the secretarial profession would have relatively less to do with the 
Code of Criminal Procedure than with other procedural laws, except for safeguarding 
against incurring of liability for criminal offences by Directors, Secretary, Manager or 
other Principal Officer under different corporate and industrial laws. Nevertheless, it is 
necessary that company secretaries and other secretarial staff should be familiar with 
some of the relevant features of the Code. It is an Act to consolidate and amend the 
371 
EP-GCL-9 
372 
law relating to the procedure to be followed in apprehending the criminals, 
investigating the criminal cases and their trial before the Criminal Courts. It is an 
adjective law but also contains provisions of substantive nature (e.g. Chapters VIII, 
IX, X and XI). It‘s  object is to provide a machinery for determining the guilt of and 
imposing punishment on offenders under the substantive criminal law, for example, 
the Indian Penal Code (I.P.C.). The two Codes are to be read together. The Code 
also provides machinery for punishment of offences under other Acts. 
2.  IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS 
Offence 
Section 2(n) of the Cr.P.C. defines the word "offence" to mean any act or 
ommission made punishable by any law for the time being in force and includes any 
act in respect of which a complaint may be made under Section 20 of the Cattle-
trespass Act, 1871. However, the term is more elaborately defined in Section 40 of 
the I.P.C. which states that "offence" denotes a thing made punishable by the Code. 
Section 39 of the Cr. P.C. imposes a duty on every person who is aware of the 
commission of or of intention to commit an offence, to give information of certain 
offences which are specified in Clause (i) to (xii) of sub-Section (1). An offence is 
what the legislature classes as punishable. Mens Rea a bad intention or guilt is an 
essential ingredient in every offence. 
Mens rea 
Mens rea means a guilty mind. The fundamental principle of penal liability is 
embodied in the maxim actus non facit ream nisi mens sit rea. The act itself does not 
constitute guilt unless done with a guilty intent. Thus, unless an act is done with a 
guilty intention, it will not be criminally punishable. The general rule to be stated is 
―there must be a mind at fault before there can be a crime‖. Mens rea is a subjective 
matter. Thus mens rea is an essential ingredient in every criminal offence. 
The motive is not an intention. Intention involves foresight or knowledge of the 
probable or likely consequences of an injury. In short, mens rea is the state of mind 
which accompanies and directs the conduct resulting in the actus reus. 
Bailable Offence and Non-bailable Offence 
A "bailable offence" means an offence which is shown as bailable in the First 
Schedule or which is made bailable by any other law for the time being in force. 
"Non-bailable" offence means any other offence. [Section 2(a)] 
Cognizable Offence and Non-cognizable Offence 
"Cognizable offence" means an offence for which, and "cognizable case" means 
a case in which, a police officer may, in accordance with the First Schedule or under 
any other law for the time being in force, arrest without warrant. 
"Non-cognizable offence" means an offence for which, and "non-cognizable" 
case means a case in which, a police officer has no authority to arrest without 
warrant. Thus, a non-cognizable offence needs special authority to arrest by the 
police officer. [Section 2(c) and 2(l)] 
In order to be a cognizable case under Section 2(c) of the Code, it would be 
enough if one or more (not ordinarily all) of the offences are cognizable.

? 
(Note: It may be observed from the First Schedule that non-cognizable offences 
are usually bailable while cognizable offences are generally non-bailable). 
  
Test your knowledge 
Choose the correct answer 
Which one of the following is the essential ingredient to try a person under criminal 
law?  
 (a) A guilty personality 
 (b) A guilty mind or intent 
 (c) An intention 
 (d) A motive 
Correct Answer: (b) 
 
Complaint 
"Complaint" means any allegation made orally or in writing to a Magistrate, with a 
view to his taking action under this Code, that some person, whether known or 
unknown, has committed an offence, but it does not include a police report. [Section 
2(d)] 
However, a report made by the police officer in a case which discloses after 
investigation, the commission of a non-cognizable offence shall be deemed to be a 
complaint, and the police officer making the report as a complainant. In general a 
complaint into an offence can be filed by any person except in cases of offences 
relating to marriage, defamation and offences mentioned under Sections 195 and 197. 
A complaint in a criminal case is what a plaint is in a civil case. The requisites of 
a complaint are: 
 
(i) an oral or a written allegation; 
 (ii) some person known or unknown has committed an offence; 
 (iii) it must be made to a magistrate; and 
 (iv) it must be made with the object that he should take action. 
There is no particular format of a complaint. A petition addressed to the 
Magistrate containing an allegation that an offence has been committed, and ending 
with a prayer that the culprit be suitably dealt with is a complaint. (Mohd. Yousuf v. 
Afaq Jahan, AIR 2006 SC 705). 
Police report is expressly excluded from the definition of complaint but the 
explanation to Section 2(d) makes it clear that such report shall be deemed to be a 
complaint where after investigation it discloses commission of a non-cognizable 
offence. Police report means a report forwarded by a police officer to a Magistrate 
under Sub-section (2) of Section 173.

State whether the following statement is “True” or “False” 
In a non-cognizable case, a police officer can arrest a person without a warrant. 
Correct Answer: False 
 
Bail 
It means the release of the accused from the custody of the officers of law and 
entrusting him to the private custody of persons who are sureties to produce the 
accused to answer the charge at the stipulated time or date. 
An "anticipatory bail" is granted by the High Court or a Court of Session, to a 
person who apprehends arrest for having committed a non-bailable offence, but has 
not yet been arrested (Section 438). An opportunity of hearing must be given to the 
opposite party before granting anticipatory bail (State of Assam v. R.K. Krishna 
Kumar AIR 1998 SC 144). 
Inquiry 
It means every inquiry other than a trial, conducted under this Code by a 
Magistrate or Court. [Section 2(g)]. It carries the following three features: 
 
— the inquiry is different from a trial in criminal matters; 
 
— inquiry is wider than trial; 
 
— it stops when trial begins. 
Investigation 
It includes all the proceedings under this Code for the collection of evidence 
conducted by a police officer or by any person (other than a Magistrate) who is 
authorised by a Magistrate in this behalf. [Section 2(h)] 
The three terms — ‗investigation‘, ‗inquiry‘ and ‗trial‘ denote three different stages 
of a criminal case. The first stage is reached when a police officer either on his own 
or under orders of a Magistrate investigates into a case (Section 202). If he finds that 
no offence has been committed, he submits his report to the Magistrate who drops 
the proceedings. But if he is of different opinion, he sends that case to a Magistrate 
and then begins the second stage—a trial or an inquiry. The Magistrate may deal with 
the case himself and either convict the accused or discharge or acquit him. In serious 
offences the trial is before the Session‘s Court, which may either discharge or convict 
or acquit the accused. (Chaper XVIII) 
Judicial Proceeding 
It includes any proceeding in the course of which evidence is or may be legally 
taken on oath. The term judicial proceeding includes inquiry and trial but not 
investigation. [Section 2(i)] 
 
EP-GCL-9 
375 
? 
Pleader 
With reference to any proceedings in any Court, it means a person authorised by 
or under any law for the time being in force, to practise in such Court and includes 
any other person appointed with the premission of the Court to act in such 
proceeding. [Section 2(q)] 
It is an inclusive definition and a non-legal person appointed with the permission 
of the Court will also be included. 
Public Prosecutor 
A "public prosecutor" means any person appointed under Section 24, and 
includes any person acting under the directions of a Public Prosecutor. [Section 2(u)] 
Public prosecutor, though an executive officer is, in a larger sense, also an officer 
of the Court and he is bound to assist the Court with his fair views and fair exercise of 
his functions. 
Summons and Warrant Cases 
"Summons case" means a case relating to an offence and not being a warrant 
case. [Section 2(w)] A "Warrant case" means a case relating to an offence 
punishable with death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term exceeding 
two years. [Section 2(x)] 
Those cases which are punishable with imprisonment for two years or less are 
summons cases, the rest are all warrant cases. Thus, the division is based on 
punishment which can be awarded. The procedure for the trial of summons cases is 
provided by Chapter XX and for warrant cases by Chapter XIX.

3.  CLASSES OF CRIMINAL COURTS 
Following are the different classes of criminal courts: 
 (1) High Courts; 
 (2) Courts of Session; 
 (3) Judicial Magistrates of the first class, and, in any metropolitan area; 
Metropolitan Magistrates; 
 (4) Judicial Magistrates of the second class; and 
 (5) Executive Magistrates; 
EP-GCL-9 
376 
Besides this, the Courts may also be constituted under any other law. The 
Supreme Court is also vested with some criminal powers. Article 134 confers 
appellate jurisdiction on the Supreme Court in regard to criminal matters from a High 
Court in certain cases. 
4.  POWER OF COURTS 
Chapter III of Cr.P.C. deals with power of Courts. One of such power is to try 
offences. Offences are divided into two categories: 
 (a) those under the Indian Penal Code; and 
 (b) those under any other law. 
According to Section 26, any offence under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 may be 
tried by the High Court or the Court of Session or any other Court by which such 
offence is shown in the First Schedule to be triable, whereas any offence under any 
other law shall be tried by the Court mentioned in that law and if not mentioned, it 
may be tried by the High Court or any other Court by which such offence is shown in 
the First Schedule to be triable. 
This Section is a general Section and is subject to the other provisions of the 
Code. 
Power of the Court to pass sentences: 
(a)  Sentences which High Courts and Sessions Judges may pass 
According to Section 28, a High Court may pass any sentence authorised by law. 
A Sessions Judge or Additional Sessions Judge may pass any sentence authorised 
by law, but any sentence of death passed by any such judge shall be subject to 
confirmation by the High Court. 
An Assistant Sessions Judge may pass any sentence authorised by law except a 
sentence of death or of imprisonment for life or of imprisonment for a term exceeding 
ten years. 
Thus, Section 26 of the Code enumerates the types of Courts in which different 
offences can be tried and then under Section 28, it spells out the limits of sentences 
which such Courts are authorised to pass. 
(b)  Sentences which Magistrates may pass 
Section 29 lays down the quantum of sentence which different categories of 
Magistrates are empowered to impose. The powers of individual categories of 
Magistrates to pass the sentence are as under: 
 
(i) The Court of a Chief Judicial Magistrate may pass any sentence authorised 
by law except a sentence of death or of imprisonment for life or of 
imprisonment for a term exceeding seven years. 
 (ii) A Magistrate of the first class may pass a sentence of imprisonment for a 
term not exceeding three years or of a fine not exceeding five thousand 
rupees, or of both. 
 
EP-GCL-9 
377 
? 
 (iii) A Magistrate of the second class may pass a sentence of imprisonment for a 
term not exceeding one year, or of fine not exceeding one thousand rupees, 
or of both. 
 (iv) A Chief Metropolitan Magistrate shall have the powers of the Court of a Chief 
Judicial Magistrate and that of a Metropolitan Magistrate, and the powers of 
the Court of a Magistrate of the First class. 
(c)  Sentence of imprisonment in default of fine 
Where a fine is imposed on an accused and it is not paid, the law provides that 
he can be imprisoned for a term in addition to a substantive imprisonment awarded to 
him, if any. Section 30 defines the limits of Magistrate‘s powers to award 
imprisonment in default of payment of fine. 
It provides that the Court of a Magistrate may award such term of imprisonment 
in default of payment of fine as is authorised by law provided the that the term: 
 
(i) is not in excess of the powers of the Magistrate under Section 29; and 
 (ii) where imprisonment has been awarded as part of the substantive sentence, 
it should not exceed 1/4th of the term of imprisonment which the Magistrate 
is competent to inflict as punishment for the offence otherwise than as 
imprisonment in default of payment of the fine. 
(d) Sentences in cases of conviction of several offences at one trial 
Section 31 relates to the quantum of punishment which the Court is authorised to 
impose where the accused is convicted of two or more offences at one trial.

5.  ARREST OF PERSONS 
Section 41 enumerates different categories of cases in which a 
police officer may arrest a person without an order from a Magistrate 
and without a warrant. These include: 
 
(a) who has been concerned in any cognizable offence or against 
whom a reasonable complaint has been made, or credible information has 
been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists, of his having been so 
concerned; or 
 (b) who has in his possession without lawful excuse, the burden of proving which 
excuse shall lie on such person, any implement of housebreaking; or 
EP-GCL-9 
378 
 (c) who has been proclaimed as an offender either under this Code or by order 
of the State Government; or 
 (d) in whose possession anything is found which may reasonably be suspected 
to be stolen property and who may reasonably be suspected of having 
committed an offence with reference to such thing; or 
 (e) who obstructs a police officer while in the execution of his duty, or who has 
escaped, or attempts to escape, from lawful custody; or 
 
(f) who is reasonably suspected of being a deserter from any of the Armed 
Forces of the Union; or 
 (g) who has been concerned in, or against whom a reasobale complaint has 
been made, or credible information has been received, or a reasonable 
suspicion exists, of his having been concerned in, any act committed at any 
place out of India which, if committed in India, would have been punishable 
as an offence, and for which he is, under any law relating to extradition, or 
otherwise, liable to be apprehended or detained in custody in India; or 
 (h) who being a released convict, commits a breach of any rule, relating to 
notification of residence or change of or absence from residence; or 
 
(i) for whose arrest any requistion, whether written or oral, has been received 
from another police officer, provided that the requisition specifies the person 
to be arrested and the offence or other causes for which the arrest is to be 
made and it appears therefrom that the person might lawfully be arrested 
without a warrant by the officer who issued the requisition. (Section 41) 
Arrest on refusal to give name and residence 
If any person who is accused of committing a non-cognizable offence does not 
give his name, residence or gives a name and residence which the police officer feels 
to be false, he may be taken into custody. However, such person cannot be detained 
beyond 24 hours if his true name and address cannot be ascertained or fails to 
execute a bond or furnish sufficient sureties. In that event he shall be forwarded to 
the nearest Magistrate having jurisdiction. (Section 42) 
Arrest by a private person 
A private person may arrest or cause to be arrested any person who in his 
presence commits a non-bailable and cognizable offence or who is a proclaimed 
offender (Section 43). This right of arrest arises under the Common Law which 
applies to India Ramaswamy Aiyar (1921) 44 Mad. 913. 
Arrest by Magistrate 
Under Section 44 clause (1), the Magistrate has been given power to arrest a 
person who has committed an offence in his presence and also commit him to 
custody. Under in clause 2, the Magistrate has power to arrest a person for which he 
is competent and has also been authorised to issue a warrant. However, Section 45 
protects members of Armed Forces from arrest where they do something in 
discharge of their official duties. They could be arrested only after obtaining the 
consent of the Central Government. 
 
EP-GCL-9 
379 
Arrest how made 
Section 46 sets out the manner in which an arrest is to be made. The Section 
authorises a police officer or other person making an arrest to actually touch or 
confine the body of the person to be arrested and such police officer or other person 
may use all necessary means to effect the arrest if there is forcible resistance. The 
Section does not give a right to cause the death of a person who is not accused of an 
offence punishable with death sentence or life imprisonment. The word "arrest" when 
used in its ordinary and natural sense means the apprehension or restrain or the 
deprivation of one‘s personal liberty to go where he pleases. The word "arrest" 
consists of taking into custody of another person under authority empowered by law, 
for the purpose of holding or detaining him to answer a criminal charge and 
preventing the commission of a criminal offence. 
Section 47 is an enabling provision and is to be used by the police officer with 
regard to exigencies of a situation. Section 48 authorises a police officer to pursue 
the offender in to any place in India for the purpose of effecting his arrest without 
warrant. Ordinarily, a police officer is not at liberty to go outside India and to arrest an 
offender without a warrant, but if he can arrest an offender without warrant who 
escapes into any place in India, he can be pursued and arrested by him without 
warrant. (See also Section 60) 
Persons arrested are to be taken before the Magistrate or officer-in-charge of a 
police station without unnecessary delay and subject to the provisions relating to bail, 
Article 22(2) of the Constitution of India also provides for producing the arrested 
person before the Magistrate within 24 hours. 
When a person is arrested under a warrant, Section 76 becomes applicable, and 
when he is arrested without a warrant, he can be kept into custody for a period not 
exceeding 24 hours, and before the expiry of that period he is to be produced before 
the nearest Magistrate, who can under Section 167 order his detention for a term not 
exceeding 15 days, or he can be taken to a Magistrate, under whose jurisdiction he is 
to be tried, and such Magistrate can remand him to custody for a term which may 
exceed 15 days but not more than 60 days. 
Officers in-charge of the concerned police stations shall report to the Magistrate 
the cases of all persons arrested without warrant, within the limits of their respective 
police stations whether such persons have been admitted to bail or otherwise. 
(Section 58) 
A person arrested by a police officer shall be discharged only on his own bond or 
on bail or under the special order of a Magistrate, (Section 59). If a person in lawful 
custody escapes or is rescued, the person, from whose custody he escaped or was 
rescued, is empowered to pursue and arrest him in any place in India and although 
the person making such arrest is not acting under a warrant and is not a police officer 
having authority to arrest, nevertheless, the provisions of Section 47 are applicable 
which stipulates provisions relating to search of a place entered by the person sought 
to be arrested.

6.  SUMMONS AND WARRANTS 
The general processes to compel appearance are: 
 
(1) Summons (Section 61) 
 
(2) Warrants (Section 70) 
7.  SUMMONS 
A summon is issued either for appearance or for producing a document or thing 
which may be issued to an accused person or witness. Every summons issued by the 
Court shall be in writing, in duplicate, signed by the Presiding Officer of such Court or 
by such officer as is authorised by the High Court and shall bear the seal of the Court 
(Section 61). The summons should be clear and specific in its terms as to the title of 
the Court, the place at which, the day and time of the day when, the attendance of 
the person summoned is required. 
Service of summons 
The summons shall be served by a police officer or by an officer of the Court or 
other public servant (Section 62). In case the service cannot be effected by the 
exercise of due diligence, the serving officer can perform substituted service by 
affixing one of the duplicates of the summons to some conspicuous part of the house 
or homestead in which person summoned ordinarily resides, and thereupon the 
Court, after making such enquiries as it thinks fit may either declare that the 
summons has been duly served or order fresh service, as it considers proper 
(Section 65). 
The service of summons on corporate bodies, and societies 
The service of summons on a corporation may be effected by serving it on the 
secretary, local manager or other principal officer of the corporation, or by letter sent 
by registered post, addressed to the Chief Officer of the corporation in India, in which 
case the service shall be deemed to have been effected when the letter would arrive 
in ordinary course of post. 
The word "corporation" in this Section means an incorporated company or other 
body corporate and includes a society registered under the Societies Registration 
Act, 1860. Thus, the societies may not be formally incorporated, yet they fall within 
the purview of this section. (Section 63) 
When personal service of summons cannot be affected under Section 62, the 
extended service under Section 64 can be secured by leaving one of the duplicates 
with some adult male member of his family residing with him who may also be asked 
to sign the receipt for that. A servant is not a member of the family within the meaning 
of Section 64. 
In the case of a Government Servant, the duplicate copy of the summons shall 
be sent to the head of the office by the Court and such head shall thereupon cause 
the summons to be served in the manner provided by Section 62 and shall return it to 
the Court under his signature with the endorsement required by Section 62. Such 
signature shall be evidence of due service. (Section 66)

Correct Answer: (a) 
 
8.  WARRANT OF ARREST 
Every warrant of arrest issued by a Court under this Code shall be in writing, 
signed by the presiding officer of such Court, and shall bear the seal of the Court. 
Such warrant shall remain in force until it is cancelled by the Court which issued it, or 
until it is executed. (Section 70) The form of warrant of arrest is Form No. 2 of the 
Second Schedule. The requisites of a warrant are as follows: 
 
1. It must be in writing. 
 
2. It must bear the name and designation of the person who is to execute it; 
 
3. It must give full name and description of the person to be arrested; 
 
4. It must state the offence charged; 
 
5. It must be signed by the presiding officer; and 
 
6. It must be sealed. 
Such warrant is only for protection of a person before the concerned Court and 
not before the police officer. 
Under Section 76 the police officer or other person executing the warrant of 
arrest shall (subject to the provisions of Section 71 as to security) bring the person 
arrested before the Court without unnecessary delay provided that such delay shall 
not in any case exceed 24 hours exclusive of the time necessary for the journey from 
the place of arrest to the Magistrate‘s Court. 
9.  PROCLAMATION AND ATTACHMENT 
Where a warrant remains unexecuted, the Code provides for two remedies: 
 (1) issuing a proclamation (Section 82); and 
 (2) attachment and sale of property (Section 83). 
If a Court has reason to believe that any person against whom a warrant has 
been issued by it has absconded or is concealing himself so that such warrant cannot 
be executed, the Court may publish a written proclamation requiring him to appear at 
EP-GCL-9 
382 
?
a specified place and at a specified time not less than 30 days from the date of 
publishing such proclamation. (Section 82) 
While issuing proclamation, the Magistrate must record to his satisfaction that the 
accused has absconded or is concealing himself. The object of attaching property is 
not to punish him but to compel his appearance. 
10.  SUMMONS TO PRODUCE 
Sometimes it is necessary that a person should produce a document or other 
thing which may be in his possession or power for the purposes of any investigation 
or inquiry under this Code. This can be compelled to be produced by issuing 
summons (Sections 91 and 92) or a warrant (Sections 93 to 98). 
11.  SEARCH WARRANT 
According to Section 93, a search warrant can be issued only in the 
following cases: 
 
(1) where the Court has reason to believe that a person 
summoned to produce any document or other thing will not produce it; 
 (2) where such document or thing is not known to the Court to be in the 
possession of any person; or 
 (3) where a general inspection or search is necesary. However, a search warrant 
may be general or restricted in its scope as to any place or part thereof. 
But such warrant shall not be issued for searching a document, parcel or other 
thing in the custody of the postal or telegraph authority, by a magistrate other than a 
District Magistrate or Chief Judicial Magistrate, nor would such warrant be issued so 
as to affect Sections 123 and 124 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 or the Bankers‘ 
Book Evidence Act, 1891. 
In terms of Section 97 any District Magistrate, Sub-Divisional Magistrate or 
Magistrate of the first class who has reasons to believe that any person is confined 
under such circumstances that the confinement amounts to an offence, he may issue 
a search warrant for the search of the person so confined. The person if found shall 
be immediately produced before the Magistrate for making such orders as in the 
circumstances of the case he thinks proper.

12. SECURITY FOR KEEPING THE PEACE AND GOOD BEHAVIOUR AND 
PROCEEDINGS FOR MAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC ORDER 
(i)  Security for keeping the peace and for good behaviour 
The provisions of Chapter VIII are aimed at persons who are a danger to the 
public by reason of the commission of certain offences by them. The object of this 
chapter is prevention of crimes and disturbances of public tranquillity and breach of 
the peace. 
Security for keeping the peace on conviction 
When a Court of Session or Court of a Magistrate of first class convicts a person 
of any of the offences specified in sub-section (2) or of abetting any such offence and 
is of opinion that it is necessary to take security from such person for keeping the 
peace, the Court may, at the time of passing sentence on such person, order him to 
execute a bond, with or without sureties, for keeping the peace for such period, not 
exceeding three years, as it thinks fit. 
The offences specified under sub-section (2) are as follows: 
 (a) any offence punishable under Chapter VIII of the India Penal Code 1860. 
 (b) any offence which consists of or includes, assault or using criminal force or 
committing mischief; 
 (c) any offence of criminal intimidation; 
 (d) any other offence which caused, or was intended or known to be likely to 
cause a breach of the peace. 
However, if the conviction is set-aside on appeal or otherwise, the bond so 
executed shall become void. (Section 106) 
Security for keeping the peace in other cases 
When an Executive Magistrate receives information that any person is likely to: 
 
(i) commit a breach of peace; or 
 (ii) disturb the public tranquillity; or 
 (iii) do any wrongful act that may probably occasion a breach of the peace; or 
disturb the public tranquillity; 
he may require such person to show cause why he should not be ordered to 
execute a bond for keeping the peace for a period not exceeding one year as the 
Magistrate deem fit. (Section 107) 
(ii)  Maintenance of public order and tranquillity  
A—Unlawful assemblies  
Dispersal of assembly by use of civil force 
Any Executive Magistrate or office in-charge of a police station or, in the absence 
of such officer in-charge, any other officer not below the rank of sub-inspector may 
EP-GCL-9 
384 
command any unlawful assembly or any assembly of five or more persons likely to 
cause a disturbance of the public peace, to disperse and it shall be thereupon the 
duty of the members of such assembly to disperse accordingly. 
If any such assembly does not disperse or conducts itself in a manner as to show 
a determination not to disperse, any Executive Magistrate or police officer referred to 
above may proceed to disperse such assembly by force and may require the 
assistance of any male person not being an officer or member of the armed forces 
and acting as such, for the purpose of dispersing such assembly and if necessary 
arresting and confining the persons who form part of it, in order to disperse such 
assembly. (Section 129) 
Use of armed forces to disperse assembly 
If any such assembly cannot be otherwise dispersed, and if it is necessary for the 
public security that it should be dispersed, the Executive Magistrate of the highest 
rank who is present may cause it to be dispersed by the armed forces and to arrest 
and confine such persons in order to disperse the assembly or to have them 
punished. 
Section 132 protects persons for any act purporting to be done under  
Sections 129 to 131. No prosecution shall be instituted against such persons in any 
criminal Court except with the sanction of Central Government if the person is an 
officer or member of the armed forces or with the sanction of State Government in 
any other case. (Section 130) 
B—Public nuisances 
Conditional order for removal of nuisance 
Section 133 lays down the following public nuisances which can be proceeded 
against: 
 (1) the unlawful obstruction or nuisance should be removed from any public 
place or from any way, river or channel which is or may be lawfully used by 
the public; or 
 (2) carrying on any trade or occupation, or keeping of any goods or 
merchandise, injurious to the health of the community; or 
 (3) the construction of any building or the disposal of any substance, as is likely 
to cause conflagration or explosion; etc. 
 (4) the building, tent or structure near a public place. 
 (5) the dangerous animal requiring destroying, confining or disposal. 
For initiating prevention under this Section the Magistrate should keep in mind 
that he is acting purely in the public interest. For the applicability of clause A, the 
public must have the right of way which is being obstructed. 
Power to issue order in urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger 
As per Section 144 of the Code where in the opinion of a District Magistrate, a 
Sub-divisional Magistrate or any other Executive Magistrate specially empowered by 
 
EP-GCL-9 
385 
the State Government in this behalf, there is sufficient ground for proceeding under 
this Section and immediate prevention or speedy remedy is desirable, in such cases 
the Magistrate may by a written order stating the material facts of the case and 
served in the manner provided by Section 134, direct any person to abstain from a 
certain act or to take certain order with respect to certain property in his possession 
or under his management, if such Magistrate considers that such direction is likely to 
prevent or tends to prevent, obstruction, annoyance of injury to any person lawfully 
employed, or danger to human life, health or safety or a disturbance of the public 
tranquillity, or a riot, or an affray. 
An order under this Section may be passed ex-parte in cases of emergency or in 
cases where the circumstances do not admit of the serving of notice in due time upon 
the person against whom the order is directed. An order under this Section can 
remain in force for two months, and may be extended further for a period not 
exceeding six months by the State Government if it considers necessary. 
13. PREVENTIVE ACTION OF THE POLICE AND THEIR POWERS TO 
INVESTIGATE 
Section 149 authorises a police officer to prevent the commission of any 
cognizable offence. If the police officer receives the information of a design to commit 
such an offence, he can communicate such information to his superior police officer 
and to any other officer whose duty it is to prevent or take cognizance of the 
commission of any such offence. The police officer may arrest the person without 
orders from Magistrate and without a warrant if the commission of such offence 
cannot be otherwise prevented 
The arrested person can be detained in custody only for 24 hours unless his 
further detention is required under any other provsions of this Code or of any other 
law. (Sections 150 and 151) Section 152 authorises a police officer to prevent injury 
to public property. 
Inspection of weights and measures 
Any officer incharge of the police station may without a warrant enter any place 
within the limits of such station for the purpose of inspecting or searching for any 
weights  or  measures  or  instruments  for weighing, used or kept therein, whenever 
he has reason to believe that there are in such place any weights, measures or 
instruments for weighing which are false, and if he finds in such place any false 
weights, measures or instruments he may seize the same  and shall give information 
of such seizure to a Magistrate having jurisdiction. (Section 153) 
14. INFORMATION TO THE POLICE AND THEIR POWERS TO INVESTIGATE 
Information in cognizable cases 
Every information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence, if given 
orally to an officer in charge of a police station, shall be reduced to writing by him or 
under his direction and be read over to the informant. Every such information shall be 
signed by the person giving it and the substance thereof shall be entered in a book 
kept by such officer in such form as may be prescribed by the State Government in 
this behalf. (Section 154) 
The above information given to a police officer and reduced to writing is known 
as First Information Report (FIR). Although such words are not mentioned in the 
EP-GCL-9 
386 
Criminal Procedure Code. The investigation of the case proceeds on this information 
only. Thus, the principal object of this Section is to set the criminal law in motion and 
to obtain information about the alleged criminal activities so as to punish the guilty. 
For the purpose of enabling the police to start investigation, it is open to the 
Magistrate to direct the police to register an FIR. There is nothing illegal in doing so. 
After all registration of an FIR involves only the process of entering the substance of 
the information relating to the commission of the cognizable offence in a book kept by 
the officer-in-charge of the police station as indicated in Section 154 of the Code. 
(Mohd. Yousuf v. Afaq Jahan,  AIR 2006 SC 708.) 
Any person aggrieved by a refusal on the part of an officer incharge of a police 
station to record the information may send the substance of such information in 
writing and by post to the Superintendent of Police concerned who if satisfied that 
such information discloses the commission of a cognizable offence shall either 
investigate the case himself or direct an investigation to be made by any police officer 
subordinate to him. 
A copy of the information as recorded under sub-section (1) shall be given to the 
informant free of cost. 
Information as to non-cognizable cases and investigation of such cases 
When information is given to an officer incharge of a police station of the 
commission within the limits of such station of a non-cognizable offence, he shall 
enter or cause to be entered the substance of the information in a book to be kept by 
such officer in such form as the State Government may prescribe in this behalf and 
refer the informant to the Magistrate. (Section 155) 
The police officer is not authorised to investigate a non-cognizable case without 
the order of Magistrate having power to try such cases, and on receiving the order, 
the police officer may exercise the same powers in respect of investigation as he may 
exercise in a cognizable case. 
Where a case relates to two or more offences of which at least one is cognizable, 
the case shall be deemed to be a cognizable case, notwithstanding that the other 
offences are non-cognizable. [Section 155(4)] 
Police officer’s powers to investigate cognizable case 
In case of a cognizable offence the police officer may conduct investigations 
without the order of a Magistrate. Investigation includes all proceedings under the 
Code for the collection of evidence by the police officer or by any person who is 
authorised by the Magistrate in this behalf. Any Magistrate empowered under Section 
190 may order such investigation as above mentioned. Sections 160 and 161 
authorise a police officer making an investigation to require the attendance of and 
may examine orally any person who appears to be acquainted with the facts and 
circumstances of the case. (Section 156) 
Search by police officer 
This Section authorises general search if the police officer has reason to believe 
that anything necessary for the purpose of an investigations may be found. The 
 
EP-GCL-9 
387 
? 
officer acting under this sub-section must record in writing his reasons for making of a 
search. But, the illegality of search will not affect the validity of the articles or in any 
way vitiate the recovery of the articles and the subsequent trial. (Section 165) 
Whenever any person is arrested or detained in custody and it appears that the 
investigation cannot be completed within the period of twenty four hours as laid down 
in Section 57 and that there are grounds for believing that the accusation or 
information is well founded, the officer in charge of the police station or other 
competent investigation officer shall promptly transmit to the nearest judicial 
Magistrate a copy of the entries in the diary relating to the case, and shall forward the 
accused to such Magistrate at the same time (required to be mentioned day by day 
under Section 172). The Magistrate may then authorise the detention of the accused 
in custody for a term not exceeding of fifteen days. (Section 167) Every investigation 
must be completed without undue delay. On completion of investigation, the 
competent police officer under the Code shall forward a police report with the 
prescribed details to a Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of the offence and 
send along with the report all documents or relevant extracts on which the 
prosecution intends to rely. (Section 173) 
 
Test your knowledge 
State whether the following statement is “True” or “False” 
If a case relates to two or more offences and one of the offences is a cognizable 
offence, the case will be treated as a non- cognizable case. 
Correct Answer: False 
 
15.  POWERS OF MAGISTRATE 
Cognizance of an offence by Magistrate 
Section 190 relates to cognizance of offences by Magistrates. The Court can take 
cognizance of an offence only when conditions requisite for initiation of proceedings 
before it are fulfilled otherwise the Court does not obtain jurisdiction to try the offence 
(Mohd. Safi, AIR 1966 SC 69). 
Any Magistrate of first class and of the second class specially 
empowered may take cognizance of an offence upon: 
 
(1) receiving a complaint of facts constituting such offence; 
 
(2) a police report of such facts; 
 (3) information received from any person other than a police officer; 
 (4) his own knowledge that such offence has been committed. 
When a Magistrate takes cognizance of an offence upon information received 
from any person other than a police officer or upon his own knowledge then the 
accused is informed that he is entitled to to have the case inquired into or tried by 
another Magistrate and if the accused objects to further proceedings before the 
EP-GCL-9 
388 
Magistrate taking cognizance, the case is transferred to other Magistrate as is 
specified by the Chief Judicial Magistrate. (Section 191) 
The Chief Judicial Magistrate may after taking cognizance of an offence transfer 
the case for inquiry or trial to any competent Magistrate subordinate to him. Similarly 
a first class Magistrate may transfer a case to such other competent Magistrate to try 
as the Chief Judicial Magistrate specifies. (Section 192) 
Cognizance of an offence by Courts of Session 
The Court of Session does not take cognizance of any offence, as a Court of 
original jurisdiction unless the case has been committed to it by a competent 
Magistrate. The Additional Sessions Judge and Asstt. Sessions Judge try such cases 
as the High Court may direct or the Sessions Judges may make over to them. 
(Sections 193 and 194) 
Complaints to Magistrates 
A Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence on complaint examines the 
complainant and the witnesses if any upon oath and then the substance of such 
examination is reduced to writing and signed by the complainant and witnesses and 
also by the Magistrate. 
However, when the complaint is made in writing, the Magistrate need not 
examine the complainant and the witnesses. If a public servant in the discharge of his 
official duties or a Court has made the complaint or if the Magistrate makes over the 
case for inquiry or trial to another Magistrate under Section 192. Further, if the 
Magistrate makes over the case to another Magistrate, under Section 192 after 
examining the complainant and the witnesses, they need not to be re-examined by 
the latter Magistrate. (Section 200) 
If a complaint is made to a Magistrate who is not competent to take cognizance 
of the offence, he shall return it for presentation to the proper Court if the complaint is 
in writing, and if the complaint is oral, he should direct the complainant to the proper 
Court. (Section 201) 
The Magistrate enquiring into a case may take evidence of witnesses on oath but 
where the offence is triable by the Court of Session, he shall call upon the 
complainant to produce all his witnesses and examines them on oath. He may 
dismiss the complaint if after considering the statement on oath and the result of the 
investigation or enquiry, there is no sufficient ground for proceeding and may record 
his reasons for doing so. (Sections 201 to 203) 
On the other hand if the Magistrate is of opinion that there is sufficient ground for 
taking cognizance of an offence he may either issue summons for attendance of the 
accused if the case appears to be a summons-case or he may in a warrant case 
issue a warrant or summons for the accused to be produced at a certain time before 
such Magistrate. It is important that no summon or warrant shall be issued against 
the accused unless a list of prosecution witnesses has been filed. In a proceeding 
instituted on the complaint in writing a copy of the complaint is to be sent with every 
summons or warrant. (Section 204)  
Every charge under this Code shall state the offence with which the accused is 
charged specifying the law and the name of the offence, particulars of time and place 
 
EP-GCL-9 
389 
? 
of the alleged offence (Sections 211 and 212). For every distinct offence of which any 
person is accused there shall be a separate charge and every such charge shall be 
tried separately (Section 218). If more than one offence is committed by the same 
person in one series of acts so connected together as to form the same transaction, 
he may be charged with and tried at one trial for every such offence (Section 220). 
Persons accused of the same offence, committed in the course of the same 
transaction, or abetment of such offence may be charged jointly and tried together. 
A person who has once been tried by a Court of competent jurisdiction for an 
offence and is convicted or acquitted of such offence shall while such conviction or 
acquittal remains in force not be liable to be tried again for the same offence, nor on 
the same facts for any other offence A person discharged under Section 258 (i.e. a 
summons-case where there is judgement of acquittal by a Judicial Magistrate) shall 
not be tried again for the same offence except with the consent of the Court by which 
he was discharged or of any other Court to which such Court is subordinate. 
The judgement in every trial in any Criminal Court of original jurisdiction shall be 
pronounced by the presiding officer by delivering or reading out the whole of the 
judgement or the operative part of the judgement in open Court. (Section 353) Every 
judgement should be written in the language of the Court and should contain the 
point or points for determination, the decision thereon and the reasons for the 
decision. It should specify the offence and the Section of Indian Penal Code or other 
law under which the accused is convicted and the punishment to which he is 
sentenced (Section 354). Except as otherwise specified in the Code, no court when it 
has signed its judgement or final order disposing of a case, shall alter or review the 
same except to correct a clerical or arithmetical error (Section 362). A copy of the 
judgement and also if so desired a certified copy are to be given to the accused free 
of cost. (Section 363) 
 
Test your knowledge 
State whether the following statement is “True” or “False” 
Summons or warrant can not be issued against the accused unless and until the list 
of prosecution witnesses has been filed. 
Correct Answer: True 
 
No appeal shall lie from any judgement or order of Criminal Court except as 
provided for by this Code (Section 372). In the case of an acquittal, the State. 
Government may direct the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal to the High Court 
from an original or appellate order of acquittal passed by any Court other than a High 
Court. Every appeal in the case of appealable orders shall be made in the form of a 
petition in writing presented by the appellant or his pleader and shall be accompanied 
by a copy of the judgement or order appealed against. No appeal shall be dismissed 
summarily unless the appellant or his pleader has had a reasonable opportunity of 
being heard in support of the same (Section 384). After perusing such record and 
hearing the parties, the apellant Court may dismiss the appeal if there are no 
sufficient grounds for interfering or alter the findings and acquit or discharge the 
accused or order re-trial by a competent court subordinate to the Appellate Court 
EP-GCL-9 
390 
(Section 386). An Appellate Court may if it thinks additional evidence to be necessary 
shall record its reasons and may either take such evidence itself or direct it to be 
taken by a Magistrate. (Section 391) 
A Court may refer a case to High Court if it is of the opinion that is involves a 
question as to validity of any Act, Ordinance or Regulation and the Court is of opinion 
that such Act, Ordinance, or Regulation is in-operative or invalid but has not been 
declared so by the High Court or the Supreme Court. The Court has to state setting 
out its opinion and the reasons therefor, and refer the same for the decision of the 
High Court. The High Court passes such order as it deems fit and causes a copy of 
such order to be sent to the Court making the reference which shall dispose of the 
case conformably to the said order. The High Court may in its discretion exercise any 
of the powers conferred on a Court of Appeal by Sections 386, 389, 390 and 391 or 
on a Court of Session by Section 307 in the case of any proceeding the record of 
which has been called for by itself or which otherwise comes to its knowledge. If an 
appeal lies, but an applications for revision has been made to the High Court by any 
person and the High Court is satisfied that such application was made under the 
erroneous belief that no appeal lies thereto, the High Court may treat the application 
for revision as a petition of appeal and deal with the same accordingly. 
Under Section 438, provisions have been made for a person who has reason to 
believe that he may be arrested on an accusation of having committed a non-bailable 
offence, he may apply to the High Court  or the Court of Session for a direction and 
that Court may if it thinks fit direct that in the event of such arrest, the person shall be 
released on bail on such conditions which the Court may include in such directions.  
Bail may be taken when any person other than a person accused of a non-
bailable offence, is arrested or detained without warrant by an officer-in-charge of a 
police station or is brought before a Court, and is prepared at anytime while in 
custody or at any stage of the proceedings before such Court to give bail, such 
person shall be released on bail. Such police officer or the Court if it thinks fit may 
instead of taking bail from such person discharge him on executing a bond without 
sureties for his appearance as may be required (Section 436). In case any surety 
becomes insolvent or dies, the Court by whose order such bond was taken, or a 
Magistrate (First class) may order the person from whom such security was 
demanded to furnish, fresh security in accordance with the directions of the original 
order. (Section 447) 
16.  LIMITATION FOR TAKING COGNIZANCE OF CERTAIN OFFENCES 
In general, there is no limitation of time in filling complaints under the Code. But 
delay may hurdle the investigation. Further, the Indian Limitation Act provides the 
period of limitation for appeal and revision applications. Therefore, chapter XXXVI 
has been introduced in the Code prescribing limitation period for taking cognizance of 
certain offences. (Sections 467 to 473) 
Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Code, no Court shall 
take cognizance of an offence after the expiry of the period of 
limitation mentioned below: 
 
(a) six months, if the offence is punishable with fine only. 
 (b) one year, if the offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term not 
exceeding one year; and 
 
EP-GCL-9 
391 
 (c) three years, if the offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term 
exceeding one year but not exceeding three years. 
The period of limitation in relation to offences which may be tried together shall 
be determined with reference to the gravity of the offence where the punishment 
inflicted for such offence is more severe or the most severe. 
Commencement of the period of limitation 
The period in relation to an offender commences (a) on the date of the offence; 
(b) if the commission of the offence was not known to the person aggrieved or to the 
police officer, the first day on which either such offence comes to the knowledge of 
such person or to any police officer, whichever is earlier; (c) where the identity of the 
offender is not known, the first day on which such identity becomes known either to 
the person aggrieved or the police officer whichever is earlier. (Section 469) 
The object of Section 468 is to prescribe the period of limitation and the Court is 
enjoined not to take cognizance of an offence specified in sub-section (2) after the 
expiry of such period of limitaiton. The object is to prevent the parties from filing the 
case after a long time so that the material evidence may not vanish. Section 469 fixes 
the day from which the period of limitation should begin to run. However, Section 470 
provides provisions for exclusion of time in certain cases. These are as under: 
 (a) the period during which another prosecution was deligently prosecuted (the 
prosecution should relate to the same facts and is prosecuted in good faith); 
 (b) the period of the continuance of the stay order or injunction (from the date of 
grant to the date of withdrawal) granted against the institution of prosecution; 
 (c) where notice of prosecution has been given, the period of notice; 
 (d) where previous sanction or consent for the institution of any prosecution is 
necessary, the period required for obtaining such consent or sanction 
including the date of application for obtaining the sanction and the date of the 
receipt of the order; 
 (e) the period during which the offender is absent from India or from territory 
outside India under Central Govt. Administration; and 
 
(f) period when the offender is absconding or concealing himself. (Section 470) 
If limitation expires on a day when the Court is closed, cognizance can be taken 
on the day the Court re-opens. (Section 471) 
Continuing offence — In the case of a continuing offence, a fresh period of 
limitation begins to run at every moment during which the offence continues. (Section 
472) 
Extension of period of limitation — The Court may take cognizance of an offence 
after the expiry of the period of limitation if it is satisfied that (i) the delay is properly 
explained or (ii) it is necessary to do so in the interests of justice. (Section 473) 
17.  SUMMARY TRIALS 
Summary trial means the "speedy disposal" of cases. By summary cases is 
meant a case which can be tried and disposed of at once. Generally, it will apply to 
such offences not punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding two years. 
EP-GCL-9

? 
Section 260(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code sets out the 
provisions for summary trials. It says: 
 
(a) any Chief Judicial Magistrate; 
 (b) any Metropolitan Magistrate; 
 (c) any Magistrate of the First class who is specially empowered in this behalf by 
the High Court, may, if he thinks fit, try in a summary way all or any of the 
following offences: 
 
(i) offences not punishable with death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment 
for a term exceeding two years; 
 
(ii) theft under Section 379, Section 380 or Section 381 of the Indian Penal 
Code, where the value of the property stolen does not exceed Rs. 200; 
 
(iii) receiving or retaining stolen property, under Section 411 of the Indian 
Penal Code, where the value of such property, does not exceed Rs. 200; 
 
(iv) assisting in the concealment or disposal of stolen property, under Section 
414 of the Indian Penal Code, where the value of such property does not 
exceed Rs. 200; 
 
(v) offences under Sections 454 and 456 of the Indian Penal Code; 
 
(vi) insult with intent to provoke a breach of the peace, under Section 504 of 
the Indian Penal Code; 
 
(vii) abetment of any of the foregoing offences; 
 
(viii) an attempt to commit any of the foregoing offences, when such attempt is 
an offence; 
 
(ix) any offence constituted by an act in respect of which a complaint may be 
made under Section 20 of the Cattle Trespass Act, 1871. 
Sub-section (2) states that when in the course of a summary trial it appears to the 
Magistrate that the nature of the case is such that it is undesirable to try it summarily, 
the Magistrate shall recall any witnesses who may have been examined and proceed 
to re-hear the case in the manner provided in this Code. Summary trial is a speedy 
trial by dispensing with formalities or delay in proceedings. 
Section 262 envisages procedure for summary trials. Sub-section (1) lays down 
that in all summary trials the summons-case procedure should be followed 
irrespective of the nature of the case i.e. whether it is a summons-case or a warrant 
case. Sub-section (2) laying down the limit of the sentence of imprisonment states 
that no sentence of imprisonment for a term exceeding 3 months shall be passed in 
any conviction in summary trials.

LESSON ROUND-UP 
 
 
The law of criminal procedure is meant to be complimentary to criminal law. It is 
intended to provide a mechanism for the enforcement of criminal law. The Code 
of Criminal Procedure creates the necessary machinery for apprehending the 
criminals, investigating the criminal cases, their trials before the criminal courts 
and imposition of proper punishment on the guilty person. 
 
For the purpose of the Code all offences have been classified into different 
categories. Firstly, all offences are divided into two categories – cognizable 
offences and non-cognizable offences; secondly, offences are classified into 
bailable and non-bailable offences; and thirdly, the Code classifies all criminal 
cases into summons cases and warrant cases. 
 
The Code enumerates the hierarchy of criminal courts in which different offences 
can be tried and then it spells out the limits of sentences which such Courts are 
authorized to pass. 
 
The Code contemplates two types of arrests – (a) arrest with a warrant; and (b) 
arrest without a warrant. Where a person has been concerned in a non-
cognizable offence, he cannot, except in a few cases be arrested without a 
warrant. Powers to arrest without a warrant are mainly conferred on the police. 
The Code envisages the various circumstances under which a police officer may 
arrest a person without a warrant. 
 
Further, a private person may arrest or cause to be arrested any person who in 
his presence commits a non-bailable and cognizable offence or who is a 
proclaimed offender. Furthermore, the Magistrate has been given power to arrest 
a person who has committed an offence in his presence and also commit him to 
custody. 
 
Whether the arrest to be made is with a warrant or without a warrant, it is 
necessary that in making such an arrest, the police officer or other person making 
such an arrest actually touches or confines the body of the person to be arrested 
and such police officer or other person may use all necessary means to effect the 
arrest if there is forcible resistance.  
 
Persons arrested are to be taken before the Magistrate or officer-in-charge of a 
police station without unnecessary delay. When a person is arrested under a 
warrant, Section 76 becomes applicable, and when he is arrested without a 
warrant, he can be kept into custody for  period not exceeding 24 hours, and 
before the expiry of that period he is to be produced before the nearest 
Magistrate, who can order his detention for a term not exceeding 15 days, or he 
can be taken to a Magistrate, under whose jurisdiction he is to be tried, and such 
Magistrate can remand him to custody for a term which may exceed 15 days but 
not more than 60 days.

Every warrant of arrest issued by a Court under this Code shall be in writing, 
signed by the presiding officer of such Court, and shall bear the seal of the Court. 
Such warrant shall remain in force until it is cancelled by the Court which issued 
it, or until it is executed. Where a warrant remains unexecuted, the Code provides 
for two remedies (i) issuing a proclamation; and (ii) attachment and sale of 
property. 
 
The main processes for compelling production of things and documents are (a) 
summons issued by a court; (b) warrant order issued by a police officer in charge 
of a police station; (c) search and seizure with or without a warrant. These 
processes may be used – (i) for the investigation, inquiry or trial in respect of an 
offence; or (ii) for any other proceeding generally taken as a preventive or 
precautionary measure. 
 
Every information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence, if given 
orally to an officer in charge of a police station, shall be reduced to writing by him 
or under his direction and be read over to the informant. Every such information 
shall be signed by the person giving it and the substance thereof shall be entered 
in a book kept by such officer in such form as may be prescribed by the State 
Government in this behalf. The above information given to a police officer and 
reduced to writing is known as First Information Report (FIR). The investigation of 
the case proceeds on this information only. 
 
In case of a cognizable offence the police officer may conduct investigations 
without the order of a Magistrate. Investigation includes all proceedings under the 
Code for the collection of evidence by the police officer or by any person who is 
authorized by the Magistrate in this behalf. 
 
Any Magistrate of first class and of the second class specially empowered may 
take cognizance of an offence upon: (i) receiving a complaint of facts constituting 
such offence; (ii) a police report of such facts; (iii) information received from any 
person other than police officer; (iv) his own knowledge that such offence has 
been committed. 
 
The Court of Session does not take cognizance of any offence, as a Court of 
original jurisdiction unless the case has been committed to it by a competent 
Magistrate. No Court shall take cognizance of an offence after the expiry of the 
period of limitation. The object is to prevent the parties from filing the case after a 
long time so that the material evidence may not vanish.  
 
Summary trial means the ―speedy disposal‖ of cases. By summary cases is 
meant a case which can be tried and disposed of at once. Generally, it will apply 
to such offences not punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding two 
years. The kinds of offences that can be tried summarily have been stipulated 
under the Code. In every case tried summarily in which the accused does not 
plead guilty, the Magistrate shall record the substance of the evidence and a 
judgement containing a brief statement of the reason for the finding. The 
concerned Magistrate must sign such record and judgement.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Throughout the world, the right to information is seen by many as the key to 
strengthening 
participatory 
democracy 
and 
ensuring 
more 
people-centred 
development. Nearly 70 countries around the world have now adopted 
comprehensive Freedom of Information Acts to facilitate access to records held by 
government bodies and another fifty have pending efforts. In India also, the 
397 
EP-GCL-10 
398 
? 
Government enacted Right to Information (RTI) Act in 2005 which came into force 
w.e.f. October 12, 2005.  
RIGHT TO KNOW 
Before dwelling on the RTI Act, 2005, mention should be made that in 
R.P.Limited v Indian Express Newspapers, the Supreme Court read into Article 21 
the right to know. The Supreme Court held that right to know is a necessary 
ingredient of participatory democracy. In view of transnational developments when 
distances are shrinking, international communities are coming together for 
cooperation in various spheres and they are moving towards global perspective in 
various fields including Human Rights, the expression ―liberty‖ must receive an 
expanded meaning. The expression cannot be limited to mere absence of bodily 
restraint. It is wide enough to expand to full range of rights including right to hold a 
particular opinion and right to sustain and nurture that opinion. For sustaining and 
nurturing that opinion it becomes necessary to receive information. Article 21 confers 
on all persons a right to know which include a right to receive information.  
It may be pointed out that the right to impart and receive information is a species 
of the right to freedom of speech and expression. Article 19(1) (a) of our Constitution 
guarantees to all citizens freedom of speech and expression. At the same time, 
Article 19(2) permits the State to make any law in so far as such law imposes 
reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the rights conferred by Article 19(1) (a) of 
the constitution in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the 
State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency, morality, contempt 
of court, defamation and incitement of offence.  
Thus, a citizen has a right to receive information and that right is derived from the 
concept of freedom of speech and expression comprised in Article 19(1) (a). The 
State is not only under an obligation to respect the Fundamental Rights of the 
citizens, but it is equally under an obligation to ensure conditions under which these 
rights can meaningfully and effectively be enjoyed by one and all.  
Right to freedom of speech and expression in Art.19 (1)(a) carries with it the right 
to propagate and circulate one‘s views and opinions subject to reasonable restrictions 
as mentioned above. The prerequisite for enjoying this right is knowledge and 
information. Information adds something ―new to our awareness and removes 
vagueness of our ideas‖.

Government enacted Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005 which came into force 
on October 12, 2005.  
 
The RTI Act provides for setting out the practical regime of right to information for 
citizens to secure access to information held by public authorities to promote 
transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority. Every 
public authority under the Act has been entrusted with a duty to maintain records 
and publish manuals, rules, regulations, instructions, etc. in its possession as 
prescribed under the Act. Further, it is obligatory on every public authority to 
publish the information about various particulars prescribed under the Act within 
one hundred and twenty days of the enactment of this Act.

a 
request 
for 
the 
information. 
The 
Public 
Information

involved.  
 
Only that part of the record which does not contain any information which is 
exempt from disclosure and which can reasonably be severed from any part that 
contains exempt information, may be provided.

Information Commissions.

aggrieved by a decision of the PIO may file an appeal under the Act. 
 
Stringent penalty may be imposed on a Public Information Officer for failing to 
provide information. The Information Commission (IC) at the Centre and at the

circumstances, including—

(b) whether a party has succeeded on part of its case, even if that party has not been wholly 
successful; 
(c) whether the party had made a frivolous counterclaim leading to delay in the disposal of 
the case; 
(d) whether any reasonable offer to settle is made by a party and unreasonably refused by the 
other party; and 
(e) whether the party had made a frivolous claim and instituted a vexatious proceeding 
wasting the time of the Court. 
(4) The orders which the Court may make under this provision include an order that a party must 
pay––
