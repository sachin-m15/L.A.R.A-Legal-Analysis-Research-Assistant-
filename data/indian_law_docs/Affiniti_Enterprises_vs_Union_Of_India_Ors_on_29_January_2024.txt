diverse businesses ranging from hospitality, Fast-Moving Consumer Goods ('FMCG')
to real estate, have been directed in accordance with Section 171 of Act, 2017, to pass
on the commensurate benefit of reduction in the rate of tax or the Input Tax Credit to
its consumers / recipients along with interest.
2. Learned counsel for the parties prayed that this Court may first decide the plea of
constitutional validity of Section 171 of Act, 2017 as well as Rules 122, 124, 126, 127,
129, 133 and 134 of the Rules, 2017. They stated that only in the event this Court were
to uphold the constitutional validity of the aforesaid Section and Rules, would the
need to examine the matters on merits arise.

W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE
PETITIONERS
4. Mr. P. Chidambaram, Mr. S. Ganesh, Mr. Tarun Gulati, Mr. Chinmoy Pradip Sharma and
Mr.Pritesh Kapoor, learned Senior counsel as well as Mr. V. Lakshmikumaran, Mr. Monish Panda,
Mr. Rohan Shah, Mr. Abhishek A. Rastogi, Mr. Tushar Jarwal, Mr. Sparsh Bhargava, Mr. Puneet
Aggarwal, Mr. Sujit Ghosh, Mr. K. S. Suresh, Mr. Nikhil Gupta, Mr. Shashank Shekhar and Mr.
Priyadarshi Manish, learned counsel addressed arguments on behalf of the petitioners.
5. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that Section 171(1) of the Act, 2017 and the Rules
126, 127 and 133 of the Rules, 2017 framed thereunder are unconstitutional as they are beyond the
legislative competence of Parliament. They submitted that the impugned provisions do not fall
within the law-making power of Parliament under Article 246A of the Constitution of India.
6. Some of the learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the anti- profiteering provision, as
provided under Section 171 of the Act, 2017, is in the nature of a tax or financial exaction. They
submitted that a tax can be levied from a subject only if there is a specific and unequivocal provision
in the parent statute authorising such an exaction. According to them, such a financial exaction
cannot be made lawfully by a subordinate legislation, when there is no empowering provision in the
parent statute. In support of their submissions, they relied on the decisions of the Supreme Court in
Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority v. Sharakumar Jayantikumar Pasawala, (1992) 3 SCC
285 and V.V.S. Sugars v. Govt. of A.P., (1999) 4 SCC 192.
7. Learned counsel for the petitioners further submitted that the impugned Section and Rules suffer
from vice of excessive delegation as they delegate essential legislative functions to the Government.
Additionally, they submitted W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 that the
impugned provisions are ambiguous, arbitrary, violative of Article 14 and confer excessive powers
on NAA to determine profiteering as no guidelines and/or legislative policy for the exercise of such
powers by the authority so constituted have been laid down in the statute. They submitted that the
failure to provide clear statutory guidance for exercise of powers by NAA in the formulation of such
methodology amounts to "delegation of essential legislative function" as these formulations were
essential and therefore, the same should have been stipulated by the Legislature. They submitted
that it is settled law that the legislative authority cannot be delegated under a statute without
appropriate guidelines or safeguards. In support of their submissions, they relied on the judgment
of the Supreme Court in Ramesh Birch vs. Union of India, 1989 Supp SCC 430.
8. They submitted that it is settled law that delegatus non potest delegare which essentially means
that a delegatee cannot further delegate unless expressly or impliedly authorized. They contended
that the Legislature vide Section 171 of the Act, 2017 delegated the authority to determine/prescribe
powers and functions of NAA to the Executive i.e. the Government of India. They submitted that the
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
53
Government of India by way of Rule 126 of the Rules, 2017, contrary to the legislative mandate
contained in Section 171 of the Act, 2017, further delegated the power to NAA to determine the
methodology and procedure for determining whether the reduction in taxes or the benefit of Input
Tax Credit had been passed on to the recipients. They stated that even NAA did not issue any
guidelines as to how to determine profiteering. In support of their submission, they relied on the
judgment of the Supreme Court in Barium Chemicals Ltd. & Ors. v Company Law Board & Ors. [AIR
1967 SC 295].
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
9. They submitted that the term 'commensurate' is not defined in the Act, 2017 and the expression
'profiteering' in Section 171 is dependent upon the scope and meaning of the phrase 'commensurate
reduction in the price'. According to them, as a result of this circular reasoning, NAA had complete
and unfettered discretion to determine the extent of profiteering. They pointed out that the
definition of profiteering inserted by way of amendment (that came into force only on 01st January,
2020) is vague and uncertain as to how the amount of profiteering or commensurate reduction in
price has to be determined and therefore, the same is ex facie arbitrary and violative of Articles 14
and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. They pointed out that even NAA, in the orders passed by it,
had not been consistent in its interpretation of the term "commensurate reduction".
10. They stated that without stipulating the specifics of the methodology to be adopted to determine
profiteering, the petitioners could not have been asked to reduce prices. They contrasted the lack of
guidelines in Section 171 of the Act, 2017 with Section 9A of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 which lays
down the broad guidelines on the basis of which the extent of dumping and anti-dumping duty is to
be quantified and Section 19(3) of the Competition Act, 2002, which lays down the factors to be
taken into consideration while determining whether an agreement has an appreciable adverse effect.
They stated that in the absence of any guidelines, NAA had acted arbitrarily as is evident from the
varied approaches taken by it while adjudicating cases of entities belonging to the same industry and
dealing with similar products.
11. Learned counsel for the petitioners emphasised that the formula used by the respondents, for
instance, for real estate companies during the course of investigation/adjudication, had not been
notified. They stated that the W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 methodology
adopted by NAA and the Director General of Anti-Profiteering ('DGAP') to arrive at the profiteering
amount of the real estate industry was generally based on the difference between the ratio of Input
Tax Credit to turnover under the pre-Goods and Services Tax and post-Goods and Services Tax
period. To drive home the point that the methodology adopted by the respondents was flawed, the
learned counsel for the petitioners gave an illustration of the contrasting results one would get after
calculating the amount profiteered/required to be passed on in case of two identical real estate
projects being developed by Developers A & B with the only difference being the advance payment
received by them prior to the Goods and Services Tax Regime. They stated that assuming that two
Developers (A & B) commenced construction of the two identical projects (having hundred flats of
rupees one crore each) in 2017 and the projects were executed at an identical pace with identical
inputs and with Developer A receiving sixty per cent of the amount (total sale price of the project) as
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
54
advance during the pre-Goods and Services Tax period, Developer B receiving only twenty per cent
as advance during that period, with all other factors being identical (like the credit availed/available
during the pre-Goods and Services Tax period), the credit to turnover ratio for the two projects
would vary drastically depending on the time when the payments from the customers were received.
According to the petitioners, if the methodology adopted by NAA /DGAP is to be accepted,
Developer A would be required to pass on 15% benefit to the flat- buyers and Developer B who
received 80% of the payment/amount post-Goods and Services Tax receive would be required to
pass no benefit to the flat-buyers. A graphical representation of the same, as furnished by the
petitioners, is as follows:
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
12. They stated that it is for this reason, the percentage of credit to turnover ratio (in Goods and
Services Tax regime) had varied from 0.2% (in Vatika Limited, Case No. 64/2019) to 20.98% (in
Emaar MGF Land Ltd, Case No. 26/2020) in the orders passed by NAA.
13. Learned counsel for the petitioners in Writ Petition No. 13657/2022 pointed out that DLF
calculated the total savings on account of introduction of Goods and Services Tax for each project.
He stated that the total savings/benefits were then divided by total area to arrive at the per square
feet benefit to be passed on to each flat buyer. He stated that as a result the flat-buyers with equal
area received equal benefit. In contrast to this, he pointed out that the NAA/DGAP calculated the
benefit by comparison of ratios as explained above and then computed the profiteered amount as a
percentage of consideration received from each flat-buyer in the Goods and Services Tax regime.
Therefore, as per NAA/DGAP, similarly placed flat-buyers received inconsistent benefits. For the
project Camellias, the benefits computed by both NAA/DGAP & DLF are tabulated below:

14. They also submitted that determination of profiteering can be made at different
levels such as entity level, Stock Keeping Unit (hereinafter referred to as 'SKU') level,
product level, customer level etc. Hence, an assessee intending to W.P.(C) 7743/2019
& other connected matters 18:24:48 comply with the law has no way of ensuring
whether its methodology is in compliance with Section 171(1) of the Act, 2017 or not.
15. Learned counsel for the petitioners also submitted that the operation of Section
171 of the Act, 2017 amounted to price-fixing and is therefore violative of Articles
19(1)(g) and 300A of the Constitution. They submitted that according to NAA's
interpretation of Section 171 of the Act, 2017, once any of the events contemplated in
Section 171 of the Act, 2017 occurs, i.e. either there is reduction in tax rate or benefit
of Input Tax Credit is availed, then the price of the product must be adjusted to (a)
the extent of the tax reduced and/or (b) the extent of increase in the credit
availability. They stated that there is no clarity on adjustments allowed on account of
rise either in input costs or in customs duty on import of inputs, supply and demand
conditions and other factors which impact pricing. They submitted that Section 171 of
the Act, 2017, to the extent it eliminates all factors from consideration in price
fixation, other than the rate of tax and credit availability, was clearly excessive,
disproportionate and unwarranted.
16. They pointed out that similar anti-profiteering provisions had been introduced in
Australia (in 2000) and in Malaysia (in 2015) to ensure that the benefit of reduction
of tax rate was passed on to the recipients. They stated that the provisions so
introduced prescribed clear policy guidelines before imposing the restrictive
conditions.
17. They stated that when Australia implemented the Goods and Services Tax
replacing the erstwhile Wholesale Sales Tax, the Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission ('ACCC') was entrusted with the responsibility to oversee
pricing responses to the introduction of Goods and Services Tax for a period of three
years between 1999 and 2002. They stated that Section 75AU of W.P.(C) 7743/2019
& other connected matters 18:24:48 the Trade Practices Act, 1974 which prohibited
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
56
price exploitation in relation to the New tax System provided that factors such as
increase in supplier's input costs, supply and demand conditions and other relevant
factors shall be taken into consideration while determining price exploitation. They
further stated that Section 75AV(1) of the aforesaid Act provided that the ACCC must
formulate detailed guidelines to explain when prices may be regarded to be in
contravention of the price exploitation provision. They stated that the ACCC had
framed detailed guidelines in July, 1999 which were later revised in March, 2000
after taking inputs from all stakeholders. It was pointed out that the fundamental
principle laid down in the aforesaid guidelines was based on a 'net dollar margin
rule'. According to them, the said guidelines enumerated all the relevant factors to be
taken into consideration for price adjustments and provided for considering the
increase in procurement cost and additional costs due to the tax change. They stated
that it also allowed averaging the impact of taxes and costs across goods or services
under specific circumstances.
18. While referring to the Goods and Services Tax system introduced in Malaysia,
they stated that the Anti- Profiteering measures had been incorporated under the
Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act, 2011 to control prices of goods, charges of
services and to prohibit unreasonably high profiteering by suppliers. They stated that
making unreasonably high profit was an offence under Section 14 of the said Act.
They further stated that Section 15 of the said Act provided that the Minister shall
prescribe the mechanism to determine whether the profit is unreasonably high
considering different conditions and taking into consideration factors such as: tax
imposition, suppliers' cost, supply and demand conditions and other relevant matters
in relation or price of goods and services W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 etc. It was pointed out that detailed guidelines were laid down
under the Regulations issued in 2014 and 2016.
19. Learned counsel for the petitioners further submitted that Section 171 of the Act,
2017 is manifestly arbitrary and unreasonable, as it does not fix a period of time
during which the reduced prices of the goods and services had to be maintained. They
emphasised that the time-frame for which an assessee could be subject to the
discipline of Section 171 of the Act, 2017 has been left undefined and open-ended.
According to them, this indefinite obligation hinders the petitioners' right to trade
and commerce and hence, the same is violative of Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the
Constitution of India.
20. They further stated that price reduction is not the only method by which
commensurate benefit can be passed on to the recipient. They stated that an increase
in the volume or weight of the product being sold for the same price is an equally
effective and legal way of commensurately reducing the price of the product. They
stated that mandating price reduction as the only way to pass the commensurate
benefit to the recipient is manifestly arbitrary and unreasonable.

21. Learned counsel for the petitioner in W.P.(C) 12557/2022, M/s. L'Oreal India Pvt.
Ltd., stated that in the FMCG industry, for low priced products, since the resultant
reduction in price is often miniscule, it was not feasible to pass on the benefit because
of the restriction in the Legal Metrology Act, 2009 and Legal Metrology (Packaged
Commodities) Rules, 2011 that require the prices of the goods to be rounded off to
the nearest fifty paisa. In support of his contention, he referred to the following table:
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 Original MRP Price 18% GST
Ideal revised MRP exclusive of MRP suggested by 28% GST Respondent 5 3.90625/-
0.703125/- 4.609375/- 4.5/-
4 3.125/- 0.5625/- 3.6874/- 3.5/-
3 2.34375/- 0.421875/- 2.765625/- 3/-
2 1.5625/- 0.28125/- 1.84375/- 2/-
22. Therefore, according to him, there is a legal impossibility in reducing the
Maximum Retail Price ('MRP'). As a result he stated that some of the companies had
passed on the commensurate benefit by way of increasing the grammage. He pointed
out that NAA vide order dated 24th December, 2018 passed in Ankit Kumar Bajoria
vs. M/s Hindustan Unilever Ltd., Case No.20/2018, had accepted the practice of
increasing grammage. However, this practice had not been accepted as a mode of
passing on commensurate benefit by NAA in subsequent orders.
23. Learned counsel for the petitioners pointed out that there is no provision of
appeal against the orders passed by NAA. They submitted that the absence of a
provision to appeal means that there is no judicial oversight over the decisions of
NAA and indicates that there is a presumption that the findings of NAA are infallible.
They submitted that Tribunals and Authorities which exercise functions similar to
NAA have a robust appellate mechanism. They submitted that lack of a provision to
appeal against the findings of NAA makes the Act, 2017 unconstitutional.
24. They submitted that Rule 124 of Rules, 2017 to the extent it deals with
appointment and terms and conditions of service of the Chairman and Members
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 of NAA is not in consonance
with Article 50 of the Constitution of India as there is scope for governmental
interference in the functioning of NAA.
25. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that NAA essentially determines
the rights of those complainants who filed complaints and determines liabilities of
the tax assessees against whom such an application/complaint is made / received.
Therefore, according to them, since the exercise of power by NAA is a quasi-judicial
function, the absence of a judicial member in the constitution of NAA renders Section
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
58
171 of the Act, 2017 and Rule 122 of the Rules, 2017 illegal and void. In support of
their submissions, they relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in Madras Bar
Association v. Union of India, (2015) 8 SCC 583, Madras Bar Association v. Union of
India, (2010) 11 SCC 1 and L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India, (1997) 3 SCC 261.
26. They further submitted that in case of equality of votes amongst the members of
NAA, the Chairperson has a second or casting vote, which renders Rule 134(2) illegal
and unconstitutional.
27. Learned counsel for the petitioner in W.P.(C) 12647/2018 stated that the report
issued by DGAP and the order passed by NAA in its case were barred by limitation as
provided under Rule 133 of the Rules, 2017. He submitted that Rule 133 uses the
word "shall" and thus mandates that NAA must determine and pass an order within a
period of three months (prior to amendment dated 28th June, 2019) from date of
receipt of the report from DGAP. He further submitted that the procedure that has
been prescribed under the Rule 129(6) ought to have been strictly followed by the
DGAP while investigating other products. He pointed out that in the case of the
petitioner in W.P.(C) 12647/2018, Rule 129(6) of the Rules, 2017 as on 25th
September, 2018 (the date on which NAA passed its order directing the DGAP to
conduct investigation on the amount allegedly profiteered W.P.(C) 7743/2019 &
other connected matters 18:24:48 by the petitioner) or 30th October, 2018 (the date
when the notice was issued by DGAP) mandatorily provided that DGAP was required
to complete its investigation within three months. However, the report was submitted
on 30th September, 2019 which is beyond the prescribed limitation period and thus,
the same was without jurisdiction. He submitted that at the time the proceedings
were initiated by NAA, Rule 129(6) of the Rules, 2017 mandated that the DGAP
"shall" submit its report to NAA within three months which could be further
extended to six months. Such time period was subsequently extended to six months
vide Notification No. 31/2019 dated 28th June, 2019 which could be further extended
to nine months. However, the impugned order is barred by limitation even if period
is taken as six months as applicable from 28th June, 2019.
28. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that under Rule 133(3) of the Rules, 2017, NAA
does not have any power or authority in law to pass an order in relation to any product, other than
the product against which complaint has been received by the authorities. They submitted that till
28th June, 2019 (when Rule 133(5) was enacted), NAA had no powers to direct investigation in
respect of any product, other than the product complained of. However, with effect from 28th June,
2019, Rule 133(5) was introduced, whereby for the first time, NAA was statutorily empowered in the
course of the proceedings before it, to direct the DGAP, to conduct an investigation in relation to
products, other than the product complained of. They submitted that as a result of the amendment,
the power to expand the scope of the investigation vests only with NAA and not with DGAP. They
pointed out that in many cases, DGAP had on its own expanded the scope of the investigation to
other products, which according to them, is without jurisdiction and ultra vires the provisions of the
Act, 2017 and Rules, 2017.

W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
29. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the levy of penalty and interest cannot be
ordered in the absence of corresponding specific substantive provisions under the Act, 2017. They
submitted that the consequences of the breach of Section 171 of Act, 2017 should have been provided
for in the first instance in the Act, 2017 itself and such wide and uncontrolled powers could not have
been conferred on NAA under Rules 127 and 133 of Rules, 2017. In support of their submission, they
relied upon the judgments of the Supreme Court in Indian Carbon Limited v. State of Assam (1997)
6 SCC 479 and Shree Bhagwati Steel Rolling Mills v. CCE 2015 (326) E.L.T. 209 (SC).
30. They stated that the petitioners have been issued show cause notices directing them to explain
why penalty prescribed under Section 171(3A) of the Act, 2017 read with Rule 133 (3) (d) of the
Rules, 2017 should not be imposed upon them. They, however, submitted that Section 171 (3A) has
been inserted in the Act, 2017 under Section 112 of the Finance Act, 2019 which came into force only
from 01st January, 2020 and so penalty under the aforesaid Section could not have been imposed
on the petitioners retrospectively.
31. Learned senior counsel for the petitioner in W.P.(C) 1171/2020 submitted that on a plain reading
of Section 171(1) with Section 2(108) of the Act, 2017, it is clear that it applies to a reduction in the
rate of Goods and Services Tax levied on a particular commodity or a grant of Input Tax Credit
under the Act, 2017. He stated that the term 'tax on any supply of goods or services' and Input Tax
Credit in Section 171 do not refer to any tax levied prior to 1st July, 2017 or to any Input Tax Credit
granted under any such prior statute. Therefore, according to him, Section 171(1) of the Act, 2017
does not contemplate a comparison of the taxes levied after the introduction of the Act, 2017 with a
basket of distinct indirect taxes applicable on goods and services before the operation of the Act. He
stated W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 that the indirect taxes levied on
goods and services prior to July, 2017 by the States such as the VAT/Sales-tax, Octroi duty and
Entry tax varied widely from State to State and often from area to area within a State. He stated that
as a result, it is impossible to make any meaningful comparison between the rates of the pre- Goods
and Services Tax taxes with the rates of tax levied under the Goods and Services Tax regime.
32. According to him, Section 171 of the Act, 2017 only permits a comparison between two single
rates and not a comparison between one single tax rate (Goods and Services Tax) and a basket or
combination of several other tax rates (pre-Goods and Services Tax indirect taxes). He submitted
that Sections 2(62) and 2(63) of the Act, 2017 make it clear that the benefit of Input Tax Credits
referred to in Section 171(1) are the Input Tax Credit granted under the Act, 2017 and not the Input
Tax Credits granted under the Central Excise Act, the Service- Tax statute or the Sales-tax Acts. He
further submitted that Section 9 of the Act, 2017 which provides for the levy of 'a tax called the
central goods and services tax on all intra-State supplies of goods or services or both...' uses the
same language as Section 171 and therefore Section 171 refers only to a reduction in the rate of tax
levied / referred to under Section 9 of the Act, 2017.
33. Learned senior counsel for the petitioners in W.P.(C) 2897/2021, submitted that in a contract
made after the reduction in the tax rate has come into effect, the parties are free to agree on any
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024

60
price. In support of his submission, he relied on Section 64-A of the Sale of Goods Act, which reads
as under:-
"64A. In contracts of sale, amount of increased or decreased taxes to be added or
deducted.--
(1) Unless a different intention appears from the terms of the contract, in the event of
any tax of the nature described in sub-section (2) being imposed, increased,
decreased or remitted in respect of any goods after the making of W.P.(C) 7743/2019
& other connected matters 18:24:48 any contract for the sale or purchase of such
goods without stipulation as to the payment of tax where tax was not chargeable at
the time of the making of the contract, or for the sale or purchase of such goods
tax-paid where tax was chargeable at that time,--
(a) if such imposition or increase so takes effect that the tax or increased tax, as the
case may be, or any part of such tax is paid or is payable, the seller may add so much
to the contract price as will be equivalent to the amount paid or payable in respect of
such tax or increase of tax, and he shall be entitled to be paid and to sue for and
recover such addition; and
(b) if such decrease or remission so takes effect that the decreased tax only, or no tax,
as the case may be, is paid or is payable, the buyer may deduct so much from the
contract price as will be equivalent to the decrease of tax or remitted tax, and he shall
not be liable to pay, or be sued for, or in respect of, such deduction.
(2) The provisions of sub-section (1) apply to the following taxes, namely:--
(a) any duty of customs or excise on goods;
(b) any tax on the sale or purchase of goods."
34. Learned counsel for the petitioner in W.P.(C) 2785/2021 submitted that as per Section 171(2)
read with Section 2(80) of the Act, 2017, the authority (empowered to examine whether there has
been commensurate reduction in price) has to be constituted by way of a duly gazetted notification
and as per Section 166 of the Act, 2017, such notification has to be laid before the Parliament. He
stated that contrary to these requirements, NAA had been constituted vide an administrative order
No.343/2017 dated 28th November, 2017. He stated that Rule 122 of the Rules, 2017 has been
notified and gazetted vide Notification No. 10/2017-Central Tax dated 28th June, 2017, which, at
first blush, suggests that NAA had been constituted thereunder. However, on a closer analysis, it is
clear that the said Rule cannot be said to be the fountainhead of constitution of NAA as Rule 122
essentially provides for composition of NAA and not for the constitution of NAA, even though the
heading of the Rule is couched to suggest that the same apparently constitutes NAA. He submitted
that if the said Rule W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 (which was notified on
28th June, 2017) was indeed the fountainhead of constitution of NAA, the same would go against

61
the very understanding of the respondents as recorded in the 35th and 45th Goods and Services Tax
Council Minutes of Meeting as well as the Memo dated 09th September, 2019 of the Department of
Revenue, Ministry of Finance, wherein it has been specifically observed that NAA had been
constituted vide an office order dated 28th November, 2017.
ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
35. Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondent-authorities,
prefaced his submissions by stating that Parliament introduced the Act, 2017 in order to simplify
and harmonise the indirect taxes regime in the country by eliminating the multiplicity of taxes that
were levied on the same supply system as a result of which there was a cascading effect.
36. According to him, the "anti-profiteering" measures were introduced in the Goods and Services
Tax regime in order to provide for a mechanism to ensure that the full benefits of input tax credits
and reduced Goods and Services Tax rates flow to the consumers who bear the burden of tax and to
prevent the suppliers from appropriating these benefits for themselves. He contended that
anti-profiteering provisions under the Act, 2017 and the Rules, 2017 have been brought into force in
the interest of consumer welfare and so any interpretation of the same must be in favour of the
consumer.
37. He stated that the provisions essentially create a substantive restriction on the suppliers from
appropriating the benefits of the Goods and Services Tax regime which may either be in the form of
reduction in the tax rate effected pursuant to a decision of the Goods and Services Tax Council or in
the form of W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 benefit of Input Tax Credit
which was unavailable under the earlier regime. He stated that correspondingly a substantive right
has been created in favour of consumers to receive the benefit of reduction in rates and benefit of
Input Tax Credit. He stated that in considering the constitutional vires of such a provision, the
larger public welfare intended to accrue from the provision ought to be taken into consideration. He
relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Ltd. vs.
Union of India, (2019) 8 SCC 416, wherein the Supreme Court examined a challenge to the
amendments to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. He stated that in the aforesaid case the
fact that the impugned provisions were part of a beneficial legislation was treated as an important
factor in order to uphold the provisions.
38. He further submitted that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 has been enacted in furtherance of the
goals of redistributive justice contained in the Directive Principles of State policy in Articles 38,
39(b) and 39(c) of the Constitution of India. The relevant portion of Articles 38, 39(b) and 39(c) are
reproduced hereinbelow:-
"Article 38 - State to secure a social order for the promotion of welfare of the people
(1) The State shall strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing and
protecting as effectively as it may a social order in which justice, social, economic and
political, shall inform all the institutions of the national life.
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024

62
Article 39 - Certain principles of policy to be followed by the State The State shall, in particular,
direct its policy towards securing-- ...
(b) that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as
best to sub serve the common good;
(c) that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and
means of production to the common detriment;"
(emphasis supplied) W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
39. He submitted that the scope of judicial review in a fiscal statute is fairly limited as laid down by
the Supreme Court in multiple judgments such as State of M.P. v. Rakesh Kohli, (2012) 6 SCC 312
and R. K. Garg v. Union of India, 1981 (4) SCC 675.
40. He further submitted that Article 246A of the Constitution of India empowers the Legislature to
make laws 'with respect to' Goods and Services Tax. Article 246A of the Constitution reads as
under:-
"246A. Special provision with respect to goods and services tax.--
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in articles 246 and 254, Parliament, and,
subject to clause (2), the Legislature of every State, have power to make laws with
respect to goods and services tax imposed by the Union or by such State.
(2) Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to goods and services
tax where the supply of goods, or of services, or both takes place in the course of
inter-State trade or commerce.
Explanation.--The provisions of this article, shall, in respect of goods and services tax referred to in
clause (5) of article 279A, take effect from the date recommended by the Goods and Services Tax
Council."
41. He submitted that the impugned Section 171 of the Act, 2017 does not violate Article 246A of the
Constitution of India as the said Section is not a taxing provision but is only meant to ensure that
the sacrifice of tax revenue by the Central and State Governments for the welfare of the consumer is
passed on to them by the supplier.
42. He stated that the reduction of the tax burden and elimination of the cascading effect of taxes
were important objectives behind the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax and so the
impugned Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is very much a provision 'with respect to' Goods and Services
Tax and, therefore, Section 171 of the Act, 2017 falls well within the ambit of law-making powers of
the Parliament and the State legislatures. He further submitted that it is a well W.P.(C) 7743/2019 &
other connected matters 18:24:48 settled principle that in the field of taxation, the legislature enjoys
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
63
a greater latitude for classification as has been noted by the Supreme Court in various cases [See:
Steelworth Ltd. vs. State of Assam [1962] Supp (2) SCR 589]; Gopal Narain vs. State of U.P. [AIR
1964 SC 370]; Ganga Sugar Corp. Ltd. vs. State of U.P. [(1980) 1 SCC 223].
43. Countering the submissions of the Petitioners that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 suffers from the
vice of excessive delegation, Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel, submitted that no essential
legislative function has been delegated by the Legislature to NAA by way of Section 171 of the Act,
2017. He stated that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is very clear when it states that any reduction in the
rate of tax or the benefit of input tax credit has to be passed on to the recipient by way of
commensurate reduction in prices, that is to say that every person who is a recipient of goods or
services has to get the benefit. He further stated that it cannot be said that Section 171 of the Act,
2017 does not provide method and procedure for determining profiteering as it clearly stipulates
that 'any reduction' in the rate of tax on 'any supply of goods or services' or the benefit of input tax
credit shall be passed on to the recipient by way of 'commensurate reduction in prices'.
44. He emphatically denied that the word 'commensurate' as used in Section 171 of the Act, 2017 has
no clear and definite meaning. He referred to the Cambridge Dictionary where the word
'commensurate' is defined as 'in a correct and suitable amount compared to something else; suitable
in amount or quality compared to something else; matching in degree'. Thus, according to him,
Section 171 lays down a clear legislative policy and hence, no essential legislative function has been
delegated. He submitted that the Courts have consistently held that after laying down the broad
legislative policy, the minutiae can always be left W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters
18:24:48 to be decided by way of a subordinate legislation (See: Lohia Machines Ltd. vs. Union of
India, (1985) 2 SCC 197, Pt. Banarsi Das Bhanot vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, AIR 1958 SC 909, Sita
Ram Bishambher Dayal vs. State of U.P. (1972) 4 SCC 485). He further stated that it is well settled
that the question whether any particular legislation suffers from excessive delegation, has to be
determined by the Court having regard to the subject matter, the scheme, the provisions of the
statute including its preamble and the background on which the statute is enacted. In support of his
contentions, he relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Bhatnagars & Co. Ltd. vs. Union of
India, AIR 1957 SC 478 and Mohmedalli and Ors. vs. Union of India and Ors., AIR 1964 SC 980.
45. He further submitted that power of NAA to determine procedure and methodology flows from
Section 171 of the Act, 2017 itself which empowers the Authority to examine whether Input Tax
Credits availed by any registered person or the reduction in the tax rate on the goods or services had
actually resulted in commensurate reduction in the price of such goods or services. He stated that
the rule-making powers of the Central Government as prescribed in sub section (2) of Section 171 of
the Act, 2017 as well as Section 164 of the Act, 2017 empower the Central Government to prescribe
the powers and functions of the authority as well as to prescribe a Rule conferring the Authority with
the power to determine the methodology for determining whether the benefits of Goods and
Services Tax rate reductions and Input Tax Credits have been passed on. According to him, it is in
this background that the power to prescribe the powers and functions of NAA was delegated to the
Central Government by the Section. He, therefore, submitted that the principle delegatus non potest
delegare is not applicable to the present batch of matters.

64
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
46. He stated that Section 171(3) of the Act, 2017 duly provides that the Authority shall exercise such
powers and discharge such functions as may be prescribed. Accordingly, he stated that the Goods
and Services Tax Council which is a federal, constitutional body, comprising all the Finance
Ministers of all the States and UTs and the Union Finance Minister, in its due wisdom, and the
Central and the State Governments have framed Rules 127 and 133 which prescribe the functions
and powers of the Authority. He pointed out that these rules have been framed under the provisions
of Section 164 of the Act, 2017 which also has sanction of the Parliament and the State Legislatures.
Therefore, since the functions and powers to be exercised by the Authority have been approved by
competent legislatures, the same are legal and binding on the Petitioners. In support of his
submissions, he relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in M.K. Papiah vs. Excise Commr.
(1975) 1 SCC 492.
47. Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel stated that even if the petitioners' contention that no
methodology for calculating the profiteered amount had been prescribed is accepted, then also the
said Section will not be rendered unconstitutional because as per Rule 126 of the Rules, 2017, NAA
has been empowered to determine the said methodology. He pointed out that the Rule does not
stipulate that NAA must necessarily determine the methodology and procedure to compute
profiteering as it merely stipulates that the authority 'may' determine the methodology and
procedure for such computation. He stated that substantive provision of Section 171 of the Act, 2017
provides sufficient guidance to the NAA to determine the methodology on a case to case basis
depending on the peculiar facts of each case and the nature of the industry and its peculiarities.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
48. Additionally he stated that no uniform calculation method can be prescribed because the
computation of commensurate reduction in prices is purely a mathematical exercise and would vary
from SKU to SKU or unit to unit or service to service and hence for determining the quantum of
benefit as the extent of profiteering has to be arrived at on a case to case basis, by adopting suitable
method based on the nature and facts of each case. He further stated that NAA in exercise of the
powers conferred under Rule 126 of the Central Goods and Services Tax has notified the "National
Anti-Profiteering Authority:
Methodology and Procedure, 2018" dated 28th March, 2018 which contains the
methodology and procedure for determination as to whether the reduction in the rate
of tax on supply of goods or services or the benefit of Input Tax Credit has been
passed on by the registered person to the recipient by way of commensurate
reduction in prices.
49. In the context of the real estate sector, he stated that in cases where completion certificate had
not been issued prior to 01st July, 2017 and the supply of service by the developer continued past
01st July, 2017, the supplier got the benefit of Input Tax Credits under the Goods and Services Tax
regime. That being the case, there is no reason why a supplier ought not to be required to pass on
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
65
the benefit of Input Tax Credits under the Goods and Services Tax regime, with respect to the
remaining supply. According to him, a plain reading of Section 171 of the Act, 2017 would require
such developers to pass on the benefit of Input Tax Credits.
50. He stated that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 when it uses the term 'any supply' refers to each
taxable supply made to each recipient thereby clearly indicating that netting off of the benefit of tax
reduction by any supplier is not allowed. Hence, according to him, this benefit has to be calculated
for the SKU of W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 every product and has to be
passed on to every buyer of such SKU. These benefits, he stated cannot be passed on at the
entity/organization/branch/invoice/ product/business vertical level as they have to be passed on to
each and every buyer at each SKU/unit/service level by treating them equally. Additionally, he
stated that the language of the impugned provisions does not provide flexibility to adopt any other
mode for transferring benefit of reduction in tax rate and benefit of Input Tax Credit. He, thus,
stated that the Methodology & Procedure for passing on the benefits and for computation of the
profiteered amount has been duly prescribed in Section 171 of the Act, 2017 itself and hence, it is not
required to be prescribed separately.
51. He stated that in the case of reduction in the rate of tax, the quantum of benefit would depend
upon the pre reduction base price of the product which is required to be maintained during the post
rate reduction period on which the reduced rate of tax is required to be charged which would result
in reduction in the price. According to him, the new MRP is required to be declared by affixing
additional sticker or stamping or online printing in terms of letter No. WM/10(31)/2017 dated 16th
November, 2017 issued by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution,
Government of India.
52. While dealing with the argument of the Petitioners that it is legally impossible to pass on the
benefits of the reduction of rate of tax in cases of low priced products in the FMCG industry,
Mr.Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel, submitted that the Rules 2(m) and 6(1)(e) of Legal Metrology
(Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 (as amended from time to time) provide guidance to the
suppliers on how the MRP of the products is to be rounded off. The relevant portion of the aforesaid

Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 as amended by the Legal Metrology
(Packaged Commodities) Amendment Rules, 2017 with effect from 1st January, 2018:
2. Definitions:-
'(m) "retail sale price" means the maximum price at which the commodity in

53. He agreed with the contention of the petitioners that in some cases, commercial factors might
necessitate an increase in price despite reduction in rate W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 of tax or availability of benefit of Input Tax Credits. However, he stated that the
prices must not be increased to appropriate the benefit of the reduced tax rate or benefit of
additional Input Tax Credit that accrues to the Petitioners. According to him, if the supplier never
passed on the benefit of such reduced tax rate or Input Tax Credit by way of a commensurate
reduction in prices of the goods or services, by increasing the base price of such goods or services, he
would be depriving the recipients of the benefits of the reduction of tax rates or Input Tax Credits.
Hence, he stated that if the supplier when increasing the base prices of the goods or services does
not account for the (commensurate) reduction of prices as a result of the reduction of the tax rates
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
67
or benefit of the Input Tax Credits, the supplier would be said to be profiteering under Section 171 of
the Act, 2017. He, however, stated that NAA as well as this Court ought to be cautious of attempts of
entities to justify suspicious increase in base prices contemporaneous with the reduction in tax rates
or accruing of benefits of Input Tax Credits, under the garb of other commercial factors. According
to him, the Courts and implementing authorities must be vigilant about devices designed for
avoidance and must seek to adopt interpretations of the provisions that are least prone to resulting
in avoidance. He referred to the judgment in McDowell & Co. Ltd. v. CTO, (1985) 3 SCC 230 where it
has been held that "the proper way to construe a taxing statute, while considering a device to avoid
tax, is not to ask whether the provisions should be construed literally or liberally, nor whether the
transaction is not unreal and not prohibited by the statute, but whether the transaction is a device to
avoid tax, and whether the transaction is such that the judicial process may accord its approval to it"
and that "it is up to the Court to take stock to determine the nature of the new and sophisticated
legal devices to avoid tax and consider whether the situation created by the devices could be related
to the W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 existing legislation with the aid of
"emerging" techniques of interpretation." He submitted that although the aforesaid findings were
made in the context of tax avoidance, they would apply with equal force in the context of any
beneficial legislation.
54. Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel further stated that reference made by the petitioners to
guidelines under other laws and to certain foreign laws, is irrelevant to the issue of the
constitutional validity of Section 171 of the Act, 2017 as validity has to be determined on its own
merits.
55. He further stated that according to petitioners' own submissions the anti- profiteering provisions
introduced in Australia and Malaysia were essentially price control mechanisms as the legislation
enacted in Australia was aimed at prohibiting 'price exploitation' and the Act enacted in Malaysia
was aimed at prohibiting manufacturers from 'making unreasonably high profits'.
56. He stated that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is not a price-fixing provision as was sought to be
asserted by the Petitioners. He submitted that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 only concerns itself with
the indirect-tax component of the price of goods and services and does not impinge upon the
freedom of suppliers to fix prices of their goods and services keeping in view relevant commercial
and economic factors. He stated that the impugned section in pith and substance is a provision
pertaining to the Goods and Services Tax and through its enactment the Parliament sought to
ensure that the businesses pass on the benefits granted by the Government in term of reduction of
tax rate and availability of Input Tax Credit to the consumers and does not seek to interfere with the
right to trade by fixing the price at which the goods and services ought to be supplied. He pointed
out that the impugned provision applies irrespective of the price of the goods or services. He stated
that it cannot be said that a law which forbids recovery of W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 Goods and Services Tax at a rate higher than that applicable on the goods and
services and which forbids suppliers from recovering Input Taxes from the recipients where credits
are obtained on such Input Taxes, amounts to price- control or price-fixing.

68
57. He further submitted that even if Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is presumed to be a price-fixing
legislation, it would not render the Section violative of Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India.
He submitted that the Supreme Court in several cases such as Diwan General and Sugar Mills Pvt.
Ltd. & Ors. vs. Union of India, AIR (1959) SC 626; Union of India vs. Cynamide India Ltd., (1987) 2
SCC 720 where price fixing orders had been challenged, had upheld such orders by examining
whether the orders take into account relevant factors/considerations.
58. He submitted that there is no legal principle on the basis of which the petitioners can contend
that the mere absence of a time period, up to which reduced prices are required to be maintained,
would render the provision unconstitutional.
59. He submitted that recently, a three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Madras Bar
Association v. Union of India & Anr., (2021) SCC OnLine SC 463, while considering the challenge to
the vires of Tribunal Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2021 and
Sections 184 and 186(2) of the Finance Act, 2017 as amended by the Tribunal Reforms
(Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2021, held that "the apprehensions of misuse
of a statutory provision is not a ground to declare the provisions of a statute as void."
60. Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel, submitted that for an appeal to be maintainable, it must
have its genesis in the authority of law [See: M. Ramnarain W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 (P) Ltd. v. State Trading Corpn. of India Ltd. [(1983) 3 SCC 75 and Gujarat Agro
Industries Co. Ltd. v. Municipal Corpn. of the City of Ahmedabad (1999) 4 SCC 468]. He submitted
that the principle of "appeal being a statutory right and no party having a right to file appeal except
in accordance with the prescribed procedure" is now well settled as held by the Supreme Court in
CCI v. SAIL, (2010) 10 SCC 744. According to him, the right to appeal is not a right which can be
assumed by logical analysis much less by exercise of inherent jurisdiction. It essentially should be
provided by the law in force. In the absence of any specific provision creating a right in a party to file
an appeal, such right can neither be assumed nor inferred in favour of the party.
61. He stated that Section 171(2) of the Act, 2017 lays down the role of NAA which is to examine
whether Input Tax Credit availed by any registered person and/or the reduction in tax rates have
actually resulted in a commensurate reduction in the price of goods or services supplied by him and
the duties of NAA have been further elaborated upon in Rule 127 of the Rules, 2017. He further
stated that from a perusal of the aforesaid provision, it is clear that the functions of NAA are in the
nature of a fact-finding exercise. He submitted that even if it is assumed that the Authority
undertakes an exercise which determines the rights and liabilities of registered persons under the
Act, the contention of the Petitioners that the absence of a judicial member in NAA renders the
authority unconstitutional is not tenable as there is no universal principle that every quasi- judicial
authority at every level must have a judicial member. According to him, such a requirement would
not only be wholly impractical but also be legally suspect. He stated that the judgments which have
been relied upon by the petitioners follow a uniform principle that whenever a judicial tribunal is
intended to replace or supplant the High Court with respect to judicial power which was W.P.(C)
7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 hitherto vested in or exercised by Courts, such
Tribunals must be manned by judicial members in addition to technical members who have
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
69
specialized knowledge or expertise in a given field. In support of his submissions, he relied on the
judgments of the Supreme Court in Union of India vs. R. Gandhi, (2010) 11 SCC 1, Rojer Mathews
vs. South Indian Bank, (2019) SCC OnLine SC 1456. He stated: (a) the NAA did not replace or
substitute any function which Courts were exercising hitherto; (b) it performs quasi-judicial
functions but cannot be equated with a judicial tribunal; (c) it performs its functions in a fair and
reasonable manner in accordance with the Act but does not have the trappings of a Court and (d)
absence of a judicial member does not render the constitution of the NAA unconstitutional or legally
invalid.
62. He further stated that there are several statutory bodies that exercise quasi- judicial functions,
but are not required to have judicial members. For example, Section 4(1) of the Securities and
Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 which provides for the composition of the Securities and
Exchange Board of India ('SEBI'), does not necessarily require the presence of Judicial Members in
SEBI. He pointed out that the fact that the SEBI inter-alia performs judicial functions has been
recognized by the Supreme Court in Clariant International Ltd. & Anr. vs. Securities and Exchange
Board of India (2004) 8 SCC 524. Similarly, he stated that Telecom Regulatory Authority of India,
Medical Council of India, Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the Assessing Officers,
CIT (Appeals), Dispute Resolution Panel under the Income Tax Act perform quasi- judicial
functions but there is no requirement that such members must possess either a law degree or have
had judicial experience.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
63. He submitted that a casting vote in the hands of the chairperson is a fair and reasonable manner
of deciding a tie in votes and is commonly provided for in several laws.
64. He stated that NAA has been constituted as per the provisions of Rule 122 of the Rules, 2017.
The Rules, 2017, including Rule 122, have been duly notified by the Ministry of Finance, Department
of Revenue, Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs vide Notification No. 3/2017- Central Tax
dated 19th June, 2017 and published in the Gazette of India- Extraordinary vide G.S.R. No. 610(E)
on the same date and hence NAA has been duly constituted by a Notification as required under
Section 171(2) of the Act, 2017. The above notification dated 19th June, 2017 was laid before the Lok
Sabha on 11th August, 2017 and before the Rajya Sabha on 08th August, 2017 as required by Section
166 of the Act, 2017.
65. He submitted that in the absence of an express provision to the effect that anti-profiteering
proceedings would abate if time-lines are not strictly adhered to, and if the time-lines are read to be
mandatory, it would result in gross injustice to the consumers who would be left remediless on
account of no fault of theirs.
66. Further, in the absence of anything to the contrary in the amendment or the amended provision,
on a plain reading of the provision, the amended/extended time-period for passing of an order
would apply to all pending and future proceedings before NAA. He submitted that the time-frames
provided in the anti- profiteering provisions are merely directory in nature and not mandatory.

67. Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel, stated that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is widely worded
and does not limit the scope of examination to only the goods and services in respect of which a
complaint is received by the authorities. He submitted that Rule 129 of the Rules, 2017, which
provides for the scope of W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 powers of the
DGAP, uses the words 'any supply of goods or services' and so the scope of powers of DGAP is very
wide.
68. He stated that the contention of the petitioners that there was no mechanism for recovery of the
alleged profiteered amount under Section 171 of the Act, 2017 overlooks Rule 133(3)(b) of the Rules,
2017 prescribed under Section 171(3) of the Act, 2017 which empowers NAA to order a supplier to
return to the recipient, an amount equivalent to the amount not passed on by way of commensurate
reduction in prices along with interest at the rate of eighteen per cent [18%] from the date of
collection of the higher amount till the date of the return of such amount or recovery of the amount
not returned including interest, as the case may be.
69. Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel, submitted that the judgments of Supreme Court in Indian
Carbon Ltd. Vs. State of Assam, (1997) 6 SCC 479 and Shree Bhagwati Steel Rolling Mills vs. CCE
(2016) 3 SCC 643 etc. relied upon by the petitioners were delivered in the context of considering the
question of whether interest can be levied for delayed payment of tax and whether penalty can be
imposed for non-payment of tax under a Rule where the Statute does not authorize the same.
70. He submitted that by virtue of Rule 133(3)(d) of the Rules, 2017, NAA was already vested with
the powers to impose penalties even before Section 171(3A) came into force. According to him,
Section 171(3A) of the Act, 2017 is therefore merely clarificatory in nature. He further submitted that
in the absence of a power to impose penalties, there would be no consequence arising out of the
violation of Section 171(1) of the Act, 2017 by suppliers and consequently, there would be no
deterrence against non-compliance.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
71. Even otherwise, he stated that show cause notices initiating penalty proceedings in relation to
violation of Section 171(1) prior to the coming into force of Section 171(3A) of the Act, 2017, have
been withdrawn by NAA and penalty proceedings in all such cases are not being pressed and so this
issue has become infructuous. Insofar as the objection regarding levy of interest is concerned, he
submitted that the object of the anti-profiteering measures provided in Section 171 of the Act, 2017
is to ensure that the Input Tax Credits availed by any registered person or the reduction in tax rate
result in a commensurate reduction in the price of goods or services or both supplied by him and as
a result, the benefit of the same passed on to the recipients. He stated that the profiteered amount
includes the benefit of reduction in taxes or Input Tax Credits which was required to be passed on by
way of reduction in prices as well as the tax thereon which the consumer is forced to pay as a result
of the non-reduction of prices as required under Section 171(1) of the Act, 2017. He emphasised that
had the supplier passed on the benefit of reduction in tax rates or Input Tax Credit by way of
reduction in prices, the consumer would not have been required to pay the additional Goods and
Services Tax.

72. Mr. Zoheb Hossain submitted that without prejudice to the fact that each and every Act of NAA
is well reasoned and justified and can be defended to the satisfaction of this Court as and when the
same are taken up case-wise, the case- specific submissions of the petitioners have no bearing
whatsoever while considering the constitutional vires of Section 171 of the Act, 2017 and Rules
contained in Chapter XV of the Rules, 2017.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE
LEARNED AMICUS CURIAE
73. Mr. Amar Dave, learned Amicus Curiae stated that the cardinal objective with which the Goods
and Services Tax had been introduced was inter alia to ensure an efficient and robust indirect taxing
system.
74. He contended that a perusal of the reports and the discussions preceding the introduction of
Goods and Services Tax regime clearly indicated that the impact on prices of various goods and
services had been factored in as a necessary consequence of the shift over to the Goods and Services
Tax regime.
75. He pointed out that the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India ('CAG') of June,
2010 dealt with the manner in which the Value Added Tax ('VAT') was implemented in India and
accordingly threw light on the lessons for transition to Goods and Services Tax. One of the elements
covered in the said report was the impact that VAT had on prices of goods. The report found that the
white paper at the time of introduction of VAT was sanguine that implementation of VAT would
bring down the prices of goods due to rationalisation of tax rates and abolition of cascading effect of
tax in the legacy systems. However, on the examination and analysis of a small data survey, the CAG
found that the manufacturers did not reduce the maximum retail prices after introduction of VAT
even when there had been a substantial reduction in tax rates. It was, therefore, found that despite
introduction of VAT and reduction in the tax rates, the benefits ensuing from such reduction were
not passed on to the consumers by the manufacturers and the dealer networks across the VAT chain
had enriched themselves at the cost of the common man. The report highlighted these aspects as
those to be borne in mind at the time of considering the shift over to the Goods and Services Tax
regime and to ensure mechanism for the purposes W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters
18:24:48 of passing on the benefit of tax rationalisation to the ultimate common man.
76. He stated that similarly, another report of the taskforce on Goods and Services Tax i.e. the 13th
Finance Commission Report of 15th December, 2009 comprehensively dealt with minute aspects of
the contemplated Goods and Services Tax ecosystem and various elements of such switchover. In its
introduction, the report contemplated inter alia that the prevailing indirect tax system both at the
Central and the State level included high import tariffs, excise duties and turnover tax on domestic
goods and services having cascading effects, leading to a distorted structure of production,
consumption and exports and this problem could be effectively addressed by shifting the tax burden
from production and trade to final consumption. The report highlighted the implications of the
switchover to Goods and Services Tax and the benefits that would entail from such a switchover. He
pointed out that para 7.22 of the said report specifically recorded that the benefit to the poor from
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
72
the implementation of Goods and Services Tax would flow from two sources, first through increase
in the income levels and second through reduction in prices of goods consumed by them. It was
specifically observed that the proposed switchover to the flawless Goods and Services Tax system
should therefore be viewed as a pro-poor system and not regressive. The report further specifically
went into the implications of the proposed switchover to Goods and Services Tax on various
products and sectors including prices of the goods.
77. He further stated that the Report of the Select Committee (presented to the Rajya Sabha on 22nd
July, 2015) dealt with the issues of transition to Goods and Services Tax and the same dealt with
inter alia issues of consumer benefit that would arise on account of the transition and related
aspects.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
78. Learned Amicus Curiae contended that the discussions at the time of the introduction of the
Goods and Services Tax Bill in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha with regard to Section 171 of the
Act, 2017 left no room for doubt that the said measure was introduced as a consumer benefit
measure in order to ensure that the past experiences of the stakeholders retaining the benefit of tax
reductions due to lack of legal mechanism is not repeated at the time of the switchover to Goods and
Services Tax regime.
79. He submitted that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is a stand-alone provision and provides for all the
parameters which act as navigational tools while applying the said provision. He submitted that the
pre-requisites for triggering the provision are specifically provided therein and the consequence of
the section is also specifically provided for. He submitted that the beneficiary of the contemplated
benefit provided under the provision is clearly specified, and therefore, all critical aspects of its
applicability and workability stand embedded in the section itself.
80. Learned Amicus Curiae stated that by its very nature, Section 171 of the Act, 2017 provides for an
inherent assumption that the reduction of tax rate or the benefit of Input Tax Credit under the
Goods and Services Tax mechanism specifically requires, as a consequence thereof, a commensurate
reduction in price. He stated that the contention that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 amounts to price
regulation is not correct as the provision has been inserted to ensure specifically that the
consequential effect of the tax rate must enure to the benefit of the consumer. The very foundation
of the same is based on the concept that when the tax rate undergoes a reduction under the Goods
and Services Tax regime, it obviously must translate into price reduction. He submitted that if there
is a variation (which can be justified by the supplier) of other factors such as any W.P.(C) 7743/2019
& other connected matters 18:24:48 costs necessitating the setting off of such reduction of price, the
inherent presumption is a rebuttable presumption.
81. He submitted that the concept of Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is based on consumer welfare and
equity. He contended that it is also the spirit of the constitutional provisions that no entity can be
permitted to collect any tax (in any direct or indirect manner or by any implicit representation to
that effect) except by the authority of law. Hence, when in spite of the reduction in the applicable tax
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
73
rate, consequential reduction of the actual price does not take place and the amount is retained by
the supplier, it would qualify as an unjust enrichment at the cost of the recipient who is the
otherwise beneficiary of the reduction of the tax rate.
82. He stated that any indirect manner of passing on the benefit like 'Diwali Dhamaka' or
cross-subsidisation would be interfering with the right of the recipient to get the direct benefit.
According to him, such an indirect method to pass the benefit is not contemplated under the express
provisions and is also not in sync with the right of the recipient to get the actual benefit of the
change in the tax rate. He stated that no such indirect method to pass on the benefit can be
read-into the provision when the same is consciously not provided for therein thereby
establishing/cementing the right of the recipient/consumer to get the benefit by way of
commensurate reduction of the price itself.
83. Learned Amicus Curiae submitted that under the scheme of the Act, 2017, it is contemplated
that the Central Government on the recommendations of the Goods and Services Tax Council (a
constitutional body formed under the provisions of Article 279A of the Constitution of India) may
constitute an Authority or empower an existing Authority constituted under any law for the purpose
of examining whether benefit has actually been passed on to the W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other
connected matters 18:24:48 recipients as contemplated under Section 171 of the Act, 2017. He
pointed out that Chapter XV of the Rules deals with the subject of anti-profiteering and inter- alia
provides the different layers of fact-finding examination that have to be undertaken with respect to
the actual passing of benefit contemplated under Section 171 of the Act, 2017. According to him, it is
clear from the said Rules that the same contemplates constitution of Standing Committee and
Screening Committee at different levels. Further, under the scheme of the Rules, it is provided that
the Standing Committee shall within a stipulated time frame after following the process prescribed
therein determine whether there is any prima facie evidence to support the claim of the applicant
that the benefit of reduction in the rate of tax or the benefit of Input Tax Credit or the benefit of
Input Tax Credit has, in fact, not been passed on to the recipient. He stated that the scheme of the
Rules therefore contemplates that such application(s) from the interested parties shall be first
examined by the State level Screening Committee if they pertain to issues local in nature and
subsequently be forwarded to the Standing Committee for action. Further, when the Standing
Committee reaches a prima facie conclusion, it shall refer the matter to the DGAP for a detailed
investigation. Rule 129 of the Rules, 2017 provides for a comprehensive mechanism which the
DGAP is required to follow once the matter is forwarded to it. Once the report of the DGAP is
forwarded to the Authority, the Rules provide for the mechanism in which the Authority is to
undertake the exercise of further considerations and reaching its final conclusions. Thus, according
to him, the perusal of the said Scheme under the Rules, 2017 therefore clearly establishes a
fact-finding mechanism at different levels culminating in the final determination of the matter by
the Authority.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
84. He submitted that in view of the purely fact-based nature of the exercise and the different levels
contemplated for such findings under the Rules the contention that there is lack of appropriate
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
74
redressal measures under the Scheme of Anti-Profiteering measures in the Goods and Services Tax
framework is clearly negated.
85. Learned Amicus Curiae submitted that there is no question of any unbridled powers being
conferred on the authority which is entrusted with the obligation of ensuring the compliance of the
said provision as enough guidance emanates from the parent provision itself. He contended that all
the factors such as the nature of the exercise to be carried out; the objective sought to be achieved by
the said exercise; the incorporation of all critical elements which are to guide any such exercise in
the section itself; the nature of the authority contemplated and tasked to carry out the functions; the
period monitoring of the same by the Goods and Services Tax Council etc. are to be considered when
dealing with the subject matter.
COURT'S REASONING PRINCIPLES FOR ADJUDICATING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF AN
ENACTMENT
86. This Court is of the view that the principles for adjudicating the constitutionality of an
enactment are well settled. Though they have been succinctly set out in a number of judgments, yet
this Court considers it appropriate to reiterate them.
87. A Statute can be declared as unconstitutional only if the Petitioners make out a case that the
Legislature did not have the legislative competence to pass such a Statute or that the provisions of
the Statute violate the Fundamental Rights W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
guaranteed under Part-III of the Constitution of India or that the Legislature concerned has
abdicated its essential legislative function or that the impugned provision is arbitrary, unreasonable
or vague in any manner. D.D. Basu in Shorter Constitution of India (16th Edn., 2021) has
enumerated the grounds on which a law may be declared to be unconstitutional as follows:-
(i) Contravention of any fundamental right, specified in Part III of the Constitution.
(ii) Legislating on a subject which is not assigned to the relevant legislature by the
distribution of powers made by the Seventh Schedule, read with the connected
articles.
(iii) Contravention of any of the mandatory provisions of the Constitution which
impose limitations upon the powers of a legislature e.g. Article 301.
(iv) In the case of a State law, it will be invalid insofar as it seeks to operate beyond
the boundaries of the State.
(v) That the legislature concerned has abdicated its essential legislative function as
assigned to it by the Constitution or has made an excessive delegation of that power
to some other body.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/

88. It must also be kept in mind that there is always a presumption in favour of constitutionality of
an enactment and the burden to show that there has been a clear transgression of constitutional
principles is upon the person who attacks such an enactment. Whenever constitutionality of a
provision is challenged on the ground that it infringes a fundamental right, the direct and inevitable
effect/consequence of the legislation has to be taken into account. The Supreme Court in Namit
Sharma vs. Union of India, (2013) 1 SCC 745 has held as under:-
"20. Dealing with the matter of closure of slaughterhouses in Hinsa Virodhak Sangh
v. Mirzapur Moti Kuresh Jamat [(2008) 5 SCC 33] , the Court while noticing its
earlier judgment Govt. of A.P. v. P. Laxmi Devi [(2008) 4 SCC 720] , introduced a
rule for exercise of such jurisdiction by the courts stating that the court should
exercise judicial restraint while judging the constitutional validity of the statute or
even that of a delegated legislation and it is only when there is clear violation of a
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 constitutional provision
beyond reasonable doubt that the court should declare a provision to be
unconstitutional....."
(emphasis supplied) COURTS' APPROACH WHILE DEALING WITH TAX OR ECONOMIC LAWS
89. Further, the Courts have consistently held that the laws relating to economic activities have to be
viewed with greater latitude than laws touching civil rights and that the Legislature has to be
allowed some play in the joints because it has to deal with complex problems. The Supreme Court in
its recent judgment in Union of India vs. VKC Footsteps India (P) Ltd., 2021 SCC OnLine SC 706 has
reiterated the approach that the Courts have to adopt while dealing with tax or economic
regulations. The relevant portion of the said judgment is reproduced hereinbelow:-
"135. While we are alive to the anomalies of the formula, an anomaly per se cannot
result in the invalidation of a fiscal rule which has been framed in exercise of the
power of delegated legislation. In R.K. Garg [R.K. Garg v. Union of India, (1981) 4
SCC 675 : 1982 SCC (Tax) 30] , P.N. Bhagwati, J. (as the learned Chief Justice then
was) speaking for the Constitution Bench underscored the importance of the
rationale for viewing laws relating to economic activities with greater latitude than
laws touching civil rights. The Court held : (SCC pp. 690- 91, para 8) "8. Another rule
of equal importance is that laws relating to economic activities should be viewed with
greater latitude than laws touching civil rights such as freedom of speech, religion,
etc. It has been said by no less a person than Holmes, J., that the legislature should
be allowed some play in the joints, because it has to deal with complex problems
which do not admit of solution through any doctrinaire or straitjacket formula and
this is particularly true in case of legislation dealing with economic matters, where,
having regard to the nature of the problems required to be dealt with, greater play in
the joints has to be allowed to the legislature. The court should feel more inclined to
give judicial deference to legislative judgment in the field of economic regulation than
in other areas where fundamental human rights are involved. Nowhere has this
admonition been more felicitously expressed than in Morey v. Doud [Morey v. Doud,
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
76
1957 SCC OnLine US SC 105 : 1 L Ed 2d 1485 : 354 US 457 (1957)] where Frankfurter,
J., said in his inimitable style:
In the utilities, tax and economic regulation cases, there are good reasons for judicial
self-restraint if not judicial deference to legislative judgment. The legislature after all
has the affirmative responsibility. The courts have only the power to destroy, not to
reconstruct. When these are added to the complexity of economic regulation, W.P.(C)
7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 the uncertainty, the liability to error,
the bewildering conflict of the experts, and the number of times the Judges have been
overruled by events -- self-limitation can be seen to be the path to judicial wisdom
and institutional prestige and stability. The Court must always remember that
'legislation is directed to practical problems, that the economic mechanism is highly
sensitive and complex, that many problems are singular and contingent, that laws are
not abstract propositions and do not relate to abstract units and are not to be
measured by abstract symmetry'; 'that exact wisdom and nice adaption of remedy are
not always possible' and that 'judgment is largely a prophecy based on meagre and
uninterpreted experience'. Every legislation particularly in economic matters is
essentially empiric and it is based on experimentation or what one may call trial and
error method and therefore it cannot provide for all possible situations or anticipate
all possible abuses. There may be crudities and inequities in complicated
experimental economic legislation but on that account alone it cannot be struck down
as invalid. The courts cannot, as pointed out by the United States Supreme Court in
Secy. of Agriculture v. Central Roig Refining Co. [Secy. of Agriculture v. Central Roig
Refining Co., 1950 SCC OnLine US SC 14 : 94 L Ed 381 : 338 US 604 (1950)] be
converted into tribunals for relief from such crudities and inequities. There may even
be possibilities of abuse, but that too cannot of itself be a ground for invalidating the
legislation, because it is not possible for any legislature to anticipate as if by some
divine prescience, distortions and abuses of its legislation which may be made by
those subject to its provisions and to provide against such distortions and abuses.
Indeed, howsoever great may be the care bestowed on its framing, it is difficult to
conceive of a legislation which is not capable of being abused by perverted human
ingenuity. The Court must therefore adjudge the constitutionality of such legislation
by the generality of its provisions and not by its crudities or inequities or by the
possibilities of abuse of any of its provisions. If any crudities, inequities or
possibilities of abuse come to light, the legislature can always step in and enact
suitable amendatory legislation. That is the essence of pragmatic approach which
must guide and inspire the legislature in dealing with complex economic issues.""
(emphasis supplied) ACT, 2017 MARKS A PARADIGM SHIFT IN THE FIELD OF INDIRECT
TAXES
90. This Court is of the view that the Act, 2017 not only simplifies and harmonises the indirect tax
regime in the country, but it also marks a paradigm shift in the manner in which they are enacted,
levied and collected in India.
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
77
91. The Act, 2017 primarily intends to provide a common national market for Goods and Services as
reflected in its moto 'One Nation One Tax'. It is a consumer-centric Act, as it eliminates the levy of
multiple taxes, avoids any cascading tax effect, streamlines the credit mechanism by weeding out
distortions W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 in the supply chains and
ensures a smooth pass-through and transparent mechanism for levying tax. This is apparent from
the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act, 2017. The same is reproduced hereinbelow:-
"Presently, the Central Government levies tax on, manufacture of certain goods in the
form of Central Excise duty, provision of certain services in the form of service tax,
inter-State sale of goods in the form of Central Sales tax. Similarly, the State
Governments levy tax on and on retail sales in the form of value added tax, entry of
goods in the State in the form of entry tax, luxury tax and purchase tax, etc.
Accordingly, there is multiplicity of taxes which are being levied on the same supply
chain.
2. The present tax system on goods and services is facing certain difficulties as
under--
(i) there is cascading of taxes as taxes levied by the Central Government are not
available as set off against the taxes being levied by the State Governments;
(ii) certain taxes levied by State Governments are not allowed as set off for payment
of other taxes being levied by them;
(iii) the variety of Value Added Tax Laws in the country with disparate tax rates and
dissimilar tax practices divides the country into separate economic spheres; and
(iv) the creation of tariff and non-tariff barriers such as octroi, entry tax, check posts,
etc., hinder the free flow of trade throughout the country. Besides that, the large
number of taxes create high compliance cost for the taxpayers in the form of number
of returns, payments, etc.
3. In view of the aforesaid difficulties, all the above mentioned taxes are proposed to
be subsumed in a single tax called the goods and services tax which will be levied on
supply of goods or services or both at each stage of supply chain starting from
manufacture or import and till the last retail level. So, any tax that is presently being
levied by the Central Government or the State Governments on the supply of goods or
services is going to be converged in goods and services tax which is proposed to be a
dual levy where the Central Government will levy and collect tax in the form of
central goods and services tax and the State Government will levy and collect tax in
the form of state goods and services tax on intra-State supply of goods or services or
both.
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024

78
4. In view of the above, it has become necessary to have a Central legislation, namely
the Central Goods and Services Tax Bill, 2017. The proposed legislation will confer
power upon the Central Government for levying goods and services tax on the supply
of goods or services or both which takes place within a State. The proposed legislation
will simplify and harmonise the indirect tax regime in the country. It is expected to
reduce cost of production and inflation in the economy, thereby making the Indian
trade and industry more competitive, domestically as well as internationally. Due to
the seamless transfer of input tax credit from one W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other
connected matters 18:24:48 stage to another in the chain of value addition, there is
an in-built mechanism in the design of goods and services tax that would incentivise
tax compliance by taxpayers. The proposed goods and services tax will broaden the
tax base, and result in better tax compliance due to a robust information technology
infrastructure.
5. The Central Goods and Services Tax Bill, 2017, inter alia, provides for the
following, namely:--
(a) to levy tax on all intra-State supplies of goods or services or both except supply of
alcoholic liquor for human consumption at a rate to be notified, not exceeding twenty
per cent. as recommended by the Goods and Services Tax Council (the Council);
(b) to broad base the input tax credit by making it available in respect of taxes paid
on any supply of goods or services or both used or intended to be used in the course
or furtherance of business;
(c) to impose obligation on electronic commerce operators to collect tax at source, at
such rate not exceeding one per cent. of net value of taxable supplies, out of payments
to suppliers supplying goods or services through their portals;
(d) to provide for self-assessment of the taxes payable by the registered person;
(e) to provide for conduct of audit of registered persons in order to verify compliance
with the provisions of the Act;
(f) to provide for recovery of arrears of tax using various modes including detaining
and sale of goods, movable and immovable property of defaulting taxable person;
(g) to provide for powers of inspection, search, seizure and arrest to the officers;
(h) to establish the Goods and Services Tax Appellate Tribunal by the Central
Government for hearing appeals against the orders passed by the Appellate Authority
or the Revisional Authority;
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
79
(i) to make provision for penalties for contravention of the provisions of the proposed
Legislation;
(j) to provide for an anti-profiteering clause in order to ensure that business passes
on the benefit of reduced tax incidence on goods or services or both to the
consumers; and
(k) to provide for elaborate transitional provisions for smooth transition of existing
taxpayers to goods and services tax regime.
6. The Notes on clauses explain in detail the various provisions contained in the Central Goods and
Services Tax Bill, 2017.
7. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives."
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
92. From the aforesaid, it is apparent that the Act, 2017 levies a single tax on the supply of goods or
services on the value addition at each stage of the supply chain from purchase of raw materials,
manufacture of product or import, till the finished good reaches the hands of the consumer. This is
best illustrated by the following example:-
Stages Actions Price+Tax=cost Cost/ Total Tax@10% Total Addition only on price
addition st 1 Purchase of raw - 2000 2000 200 2200 material by manufacturer 2nd
Sold finished goods to 2000+200=2200 500 2700 50 2750 wholesaler (raw material
to finished goods) 3rd Purchase of finished 2700+50=2750 400 3150 40 3190 goods
by Trader 4th Purchase of finished 3150+40=3190 300 3490 30 3520 goods by actual
consumer Total 3200 320 3520
93. The Goods and Service Tax is a destination-based tax and is levied at the point of consumption.
Accordingly, the taxes get accumulated with the original price and due to the effect of Input Tax
Credit, the cascading effect i.e. tax on tax is removed. This is best illustrated by the following
example:-
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 OLD SYSTEM GOODS AND
SERVICES TAX SYSTEM MANUFACTURING COST OF CAR MANUFACTURING
COST OF CAR 250,000 250,000 ADD: PROFIT @20% 50,000 ADD: PROFIT @20%
50,000 TOTAL COST 300,000 TOTAL COST 300,000 ADD: EXCISE DUTY @10%

SERVICES TAX @ 20% 60000 COST TO CUSTOMER 3,60,000
94. Consequently, the intent of the Act, 2017 is to provide a common national market, boost
productivity, increase competitiveness, broaden the tax base and make India a manufacturing hub.

SECTION 171 MANDATES THAT TAX FOREGONE HAS TO BE PASSED ON AS A
COMMENSURATE REDUCTION IN PRICE.
95. As rightly pointed out by the learned Amicus Curiae, the introduction of the system of Goods and
Services Tax was preceded by a comprehensive examination of the subject by different committees
and the reports of such committees had been factored in while finalizing the framework of the
Goods and Services Tax.
96. An area of concern identified in the said reports was that though with the doing away of
multiplicity and cascading of taxes, the prices of goods and services would come down, yet would
this benefit, if any, be passed on to the consumer by the manufacturers and sellers. To ensure that
the benefit is passed on, an anti-profiteering provision in the form of Section 171 of the Act, 2017,
was introduced.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
97. Section 171 of the Act, 2017 mandates that the suppliers shall pass on the benefit of reduction of
the rate of Goods and Services Tax or Input Tax Credits by way of commensurate reduction in prices
to the recipient. Section 171 deals with amounts that the Central and State Governments have
foregone from the public exchequer in favour of the consumers. This Court is of the view that the
amounts foregone from the public exchequer in favour of the consumers cannot be appropriated by
the manufacturers, traders, distributors etc. To allow them to do so would amount to unjust
enrichment. Consequently, when the Goods and Services Tax rate gets reduced or the benefit of
input tax credit, becomes available as a necessary consequence the final price paid by the recipient
obviously requires to be reduced. In the absence of such anti-profiteering provisions, there would be
no legal obligation to pass on the benefit of the Goods and Services Tax regime and, consequently,
the intended objective of reducing overall tax rates and mitigating the cascading effect would not be
achieved.
98. The expression 'profiteered' has been defined in the Explanation to Section 171 of the Act, 2017
to mean 'the amount determined on account of not passing the benefit of reduction in rate of tax on
supply of goods or services or both or the benefit of input tax credit to the recipient by way of
commensurate reduction in the price of the goods or services or both'. According to Collins English
Dictionary - Complete and Unabridged, 12th Edition 2014, the word 'commensurate' means "1.
having the same extent or duration; 2. corresponding in degree, amount, or size; proportionate; 3.
able to be measured by a common standard; commensurable." The word 'commensurate' has been
used in several judgments of the Supreme Court for laying down yardsticks in different contexts,
from determining the rightfulness of the posting of a public servant, to assessing the correctness of
criminal sentencing and calculating maintenance amounts W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 indicating that the Courts too have a clear and definite understanding of this word.
[See: P.K. Chinnasamy v. Govt. of T.N., (1987) 4 SCC 601; Centre for PIL v. Housing & Urban
Development Corpn. Ltd., (2017) 3 SCC 605; Dinesh v. State of Rajasthan, (2006) 3 SCC 771; Vimala
(K.) v. Veeraswamy (K.), (1991) 2 SCC 375].
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
81
99. The obligation of effecting/making a "commensurate" reduction in prices, as mentioned
hereinabove, is relevant to the underlying objective of the Goods and Services Tax regime which is to
ensure that suppliers pass on the benefits of reduction in the rate of tax and Input Tax Credit to the
consumers, especially since the Goods and Services Tax is a consumption-based tax (as adopted in
India) and the recipient (consumer) practically pays the taxes which are included in the final price.
Section 171 of the Act, 2017, therefore, is not to be looked at as a price control measure but is to be
seen to be directly connected with the objectives of the Goods and Services Tax regime.
Consequently, the word 'commensurate' in Section 171 of the Act, 2017 means that whatever actual
saving arises due to the reduction in rates of tax or the benefit of the Input Tax Credit, in rupee and
paisa terms, must be reflected as equal or near about reduction in price . In other words, tax
foregone by the authorities has to be passed on to the consumer as commensurate reduction in
price.
100. Accordingly, Section 171 of the Act, 2017 has been enacted, in public interest, with the
consumer welfare objective of ensuring that suppliers pass on the benefit of Input Tax Credits and
reduction of rate of Goods and Services Tax to the consumers. The Section does this by firstly
creating a substantive obligation under sub-section (1) requiring manufacturers / suppliers to pass
on benefits of Input Tax Credits and/or reduction in rate of tax by way of commensurate reduction
in prices to the recipients. The said Section further W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters
18:24:48 enables the establishment of an Authority to determine whether Suppliers have passed on
the benefits of Input Tax Credits and reduction of the tax rates, and to exercise such other powers
and functions as may be prescribed.
101. This Court is in agreement with the submission of the Respondents that the objective behind
Section 171 is directly relatable to the Directive Principles of State Policy contained in Article 38(1)
of the Constitution which requires the State to strive to secure a social order in which justice, social,
economic and political shall inform all institutions of the national life and Articles 39(b) and (c) of
the Constitution which require the State to direct its policy towards ensuring that the ownership and
control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to sub-serve the
common good and that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of
wealth and means of production to the common detriment.
102. To summarise, Section 171 of the Act, 2017 mandates that whatever is saved in tax must be
reduced in price. Section 171 of the Act, 2017 incorporates the principle of unjust enrichment.
Accordingly, it has a flavor of consumer welfare regulatory measure, as it seeks to achieve the
primary objective behind the Goods and Services Tax regime i.e. to overcome the cascading effect of
indirect taxes and to reduce the tax burden on the final consumer. Consequently, the judgments of
Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (supra), Indian Carbon Limited (supra), V.V.S. Sugars
(supra) and Shree Bhagwati Steel Rolling Mills v. CCE (supra), relied on by the Petitioners, are not
applicable as they deal with the validity of delegated authority imposing tax/fee or charging interest
on delayed payment of tax in the absence of empowering provision in the statute.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 SECTION 171 FALLS WITHIN THE
LAW-MAKING POWER OF THE PARLIAMENT UNDER ARTICLE 246A
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
82
103. Article 246A of the Constitution of India defines the source of power as well as the field of
legislation (with respect to goods and services tax) obviating the need to refer to the Seventh
Schedule of the Constitution. Article 246A is available to both the Parliament and the State
Legislatures. The said Article embodies the constitutional principle of simultaneous levy as distinct
from the principle of concurrence. However, the Parliament has the exclusive power to enact Goods
and Services Tax legislation where the supply of goods or services takes place in the course of
inter-State trade or commerce. The Supreme Court in Union of India vs. VKC Footsteps India (P)
Ltd. (supra) has held, 'The One Hundred and First Amendment to the Constitution is a watershed
moment in the evolution of cooperative federalism'.
104. Article 246A of the Constitution of India empowers the Parliament and Legislatures to make
laws 'with respect to' goods and services tax. This expression is similar to that used in Article 246
which empowers the Parliament and State Legislatures to make laws 'with respect to' the various
subject-matters enumerated in the Seventh Schedule. The Supreme Court has consistently held that
the expression 'with respect to' is of wide amplitude and thus, the law making power with regard to
Goods and Services Tax includes all ancillary, incidental and necessary matters. In Welfare
Association, A.R.P., Maharashtra Vs. Ranjit P. Gohil, (2003) 9 SCC 358, the Supreme Court has held
as under:-
"28. The fountain source of legislative power exercised by Parliament or the State
Legislatures is not Schedule 7; the fountain source is Article 246 and other provisions
of the Constitution. The function of the three lists in the Seventh Schedule is merely
to demarcate legislative fields between Parliament and States and not to confer any
legislative power. The several entries mentioned in the three lists are fields of
legislation. The Constitution-makers purposely used general and W.P.(C) 7743/2019
& other connected matters 18:24:48 comprehensive words having a wide import
without trying to particularize. Such construction should be placed on the entries in
the lists as makes them effective; any construction which will result in any of the
entries being rendered futile or otiose must be avoided. That interpretation has
invariably been countenanced by the constitutional jurists, which gives the words
used in every entry the widest- possible amplitude. Each general word employed in
the entries has been held to carry an extended meaning so as to comprehend all
ancillary and subsidiary matters within the meaning of the entry so long as it can be
fairly accommodated subject to an overall limitation that the courts cannot extend
the field of an entry to such an extent as to result in inclusion of such matters as the
framers of the Constitution never intended to be included within the scope of the
entry or so as to transgress into the field of another entry placed in another list.
29. In every case where the legislative competence of a legislature in regard to a
particular enactment is challenged with reference to the entries in the various lists, it
is necessary to examine the pith and substance of the Act and to find out if the matter
comes substantially within an item in the list. The express words employed in an
entry would necessarily include incidental and ancillary matters so as to make the
legislation effective. The scheme of the Act under scrutiny, its object and purpose, its
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
83
true nature and character and the pith and substance of the legislation are to be
focused at. It is a fundamental principle of constitutional law that everything
necessary to the exercise of a power is included in the grant of the power (see the
Constitution Bench decision in Chaturbhai M. Patel v. Union of India [AIR 1960 SC
424 : (1960) 2 SCR 362] )."
(emphasis supplied)
105. In R.S. Joshi, Sales Tax Officer, Gujarat & Ors. vs. Ajit Mills Limited & Anr., (1977) 4 SCC 98, a
Seven-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court clearly held that providing for measures dealing with
aspects of unjustly retained amounts as tax in the concerned statute were necessary / ancillary
aspects connected with the subject of taxation. The relevant portion of the said judgment is
reproduced hereinbelow:-
"13. Bearing in mind the quintessential aspects of the rival contentions, let us stop
and take stock. The facts of the case are plain. The professed object of the law is clear.
The motive of the legislature is irrelevant to castigate an Act as a colourable device.
The interdict on public mischief and the insurance of consumer interests against
likely, albeit, unwitting or "ex abundanti cautela" excesses in the working of a statute
are not merely an ancillary power but surely a necessary obligation of a social welfare
state. One potent prohibitory process for this consummation is to penalize the trader
by casting a no-fault or absolute liability W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 to "cough up" to the State the total "unjust" takings snapped up and
retained by him "by way of tax" where tax is not so due from him, apart from other
punitive impositions to deter and to sober the merchants whose arts of dealing with
customers may include "many a little makes a mickle'. If these steps in reasoning
have the necessary nexus with the power to tax under Entry 54 List II, it passes one's
comprehension how the impugned legislation can be denounced as exceeding
legislative competence or as a "colourable device" or as "supplementary, not
complementary'. But this is precisely what the High Court has done, calling to its aid
passages culled from the rulings of this Court and curiously distinguishing an earlier
Division Bench decision of that very Court -- a procedure which, moderately
expressed, does not accord with comity, discipline and the rule of law. The puzzle is
how minds trained to objectify law can reach fiercely opposing conclusions.
xxx xxx xxx
24. In a developing country, with the mass of the people illiterate and below the
poverty line, and most of the commodities concerned constitute their daily
requirements, we see sufficient nexus between the power to tax and the incidental
power to protect purchasers from being subjected to an unlawful burden. Social
justice clauses, integrally connected with the taxing provisions, cannot be viewed as a
mere device or wanting in incidentality. Nor are we impressed with the contention
turning on the dealer being an agent (or not) of the State vis-a-vis sales tax ; and why
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
84
should the State suspect when it obligates itself to return the moneys to the
purchasers? We do not think it is more feasible for ordinary buyers to recover from
the common run of dealers small sums than from Government. We expect a sensitive
government not to bluff but to hand back. So, we largely disagree with Ashoka while
we generally agree with Abdul Quader. We must mention that the question as to
whether an amount which is illegally collected as sales tax can be forfeited did not
arise for consideration in Ashoka.
25. We may conclude with the thought that Parliament and the State legislatures will
make haste to inaugurate viable public interest litigation procedures cutting costs
and delays. After all, the reality of rights is their actual enjoyment by the citizen and
not a theoretical set of magnificent grants. "An acre in Middlesex', said Macaulay, "is
better than a principality in Utopia'. Added Prof. Schwartz : "A legal system that
works to serve the community is better than the academic conceptions of a bevy of
Platonic guardians unresponsive to public needs."
(emphasis supplied)
106. Keeping in view the aforesaid, this Court is of the view that the anti- profiteering mechanism as
incorporated in Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is in the exercise of the Parliament's power to legislate
on ancillary and necessary aspects/matters of Goods and Services Tax apart from being a social
welfare W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 measure as it amplifies and extends
the earlier concept of barring persons to undertake exercise of collecting monies from the
consumers by false representation.
107. Consequently, this Court is of the view that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 falls within the
law-making power of the Parliament under Article 246A of the Constitution dealing with the
ancillary and necessary aspects of Goods and Services Tax and is not beyond the legislative
competence of the Parliament.
SECTION 171 LAYS OUT A CLEAR LEGISLATIVE POLICY AND DOES NOT DELEGATE ANY
ESSENTIAL LEGISLATIVE FUNCTION
108. This Court is of the view that Section 171 of the Act 2017 is a complete code in itself and it does
not suffer from any ambiguity or arbitrariness. Section 171 of the Act 2017 sets out the function,
duty, responsibility and power of NAA with exactitude. It stipulates that the pre-conditions for
applicability of the provision are either the event of reduction in rate of tax or the availability of
benefit of input tax credit (resulting in such reduction). Once the said pre- requisites/conditions
exist, the direct consequence contemplated i.e. reduction of the price must follow. Therefore, if
before such reduction of rate of taxes or benefit of Input Tax Credit, the price paid by the recipient
inclusive of the applicable tax at the relevant time was a particular amount, then on account of the
reduction of the tax rate or the benefit of the Input Tax Credit, there has to be reduction in the
subject price. Further, the reduction in the tax rate or the benefit of Input Tax Credit which is
mandated to be passed on to the recipient is a matter of right for the recipient and consequentially,
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024

the price reduction must be commensurate to such benefit. For instance, when the Goods and
Services Tax rate on a service of Rs.100 is 28%, the MRP of the service at which it is sold to W.P.(C)
7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 the consumer is Rs.128. When the Goods and
Services Tax rate is reduced by the Government from 28% to 18%, the provision requires that this
reduction in Goods and Services Tax rate should be reflected in the price of the service and the
benefit from such reduction of tax rate should be passed on to the consumers by way of
commensurate reduction in the price. As a result, the new MRP of the service should be Rs.118.
109. In Re The Delhi Laws Act AIR (1951) SC 332, while answering the question of what is an
essential legislative function, the Supreme Court held that "the essential legislative function consists
in the determination or choosing of the legislative policy and of formally enacting that policy into a
binding rule of conduct. It is open to the legislature to formulate the policy as broadly and with as
little or as much details as it thinks proper and it may delegate the rest of the legislative work to a
subordinate authority who will work out the details within the framework of that policy."
110. Keeping in view the aforesaid mandate of law, it is apparent that Section 171 of the Act, 2017
lays out a clear legislative policy. This Court is of the view that the necessary navigational tools,
guidelines as well as checks and balances have been incorporated in the provision itself to guide any
authority tasked with ensuring its workability. Consequently, Section 171 of the Act 2017 neither
delegates any essential legislative function nor violates Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
111. As per Section 171(2), the Central Government may, on recommendations of the Council, by
notification, constitute an Authority to examine whether Input Tax Credits availed by any registered
person or the reduction in the tax rate have actually resulted in a commensurate reduction in the
price of the goods or services. Section 171(3) of the Act, 2017 stipulates that the Authority i.e. NAA
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 shall exercise such powers and discharge
such function as may be prescribed. It is in exercise of this power that the Central Government has
enacted Rule 126 of the Rules, 2017 empowering NAA to determine the methodology and procedure
for determining whether the benefit has been passed on to the recipient by way of commensurate
reduction in prices. Consequently, on a conjoint reading of Sections 171(2) and 171(3) of the Act,
2017, it is evident that the powers conferred on NAA by the Central Government under Rule 126 of
the Rules, 2017 were intended by the Legislature to be exercised by the NAA itself. In fact, in
exercise of its powers under Rule 126 of the Rules, 2017, NAA has issued the 'National
Anti-Profiteering Authority: Methodology and Procedure, 2018' dated 28th March, 2018.
112. The Supreme Court in Sahni Silk Mills (P) Ltd. v. ESI Corpn., (1994) 5 SCC 346 while discussing
the maxim of delegatus non potest delegare has held that, "The basic principle behind the aforesaid
maxim is that "a discretion conferred by statute is prima facie intended to be exercised by the
authority on which the statute has conferred it and by no other authority, but this intention may be
negatived by any contrary indications found in the language, scope or object of the statute". (Vide
John Willis, "Delegatus non potest delegare, (1943) 21 Can. Bar Rev. 257, 259)". Therefore, the
principle of delegatus non potest delegare is not applicable to the present batch of matters.

113. Further, Section 166 of the Act, 2017 provides that every rule made by the Government in
exercise of its powers under Section 164 of the Act, 2017 shall be laid before each house of the
Parliament and that if both Houses agree to make any modification in the rule or both Houses agree
that the rule should not be made, the rule shall thereafter have effect only in such modified form or
be of no effect as the case maybe.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
114. The Supreme Court in D.S. Grewal v. State of Punjab 1958 SCC OnLine SC 9 in respect of a
similar provision in the All-India Services Act, 1951 has observed as follows:
" At the same time Parliament took care to see that these rules were laid on the table
of Parliament for fourteen days before they were to come into force and they were
subject to modification, whether by way of repeal or amendment on a motion made
by Parliament during the session in which they are so laid. This makes it perfectly
clear that Parliament has in no way abdicated its authority, but is keeping strict
vigilance and control over its delegate."
(emphasis supplied) [
115. Consequently, the Executive by framing Rule 126 of the Rules, 2017 has in no manner
encroached upon the jurisdiction of the Parliament. The Petitioners, throughout the hearing of the
case, have repeatedly pointed out that the NAA has adopted varied approaches with regard to
entities dealing with similar products in identical circumstances. If that is the case, then, it may
make the orders passed by NAA bad, but would not invalidate either Section 171 or the Rules framed
thereunder. Further, as the substantive mandate under Section 171(1) is itself a sound guiding
principle for the framing of Rules and the functioning of NAA, the argument that Rule 126 suffers
from excessive delegation is untenable in law.
IMPUGNED PROVISIONS ARE NOT A PRICE FIXING MECHANISM. THEY DO NOT VIOLATE
EITHER ARTICLE 19(1)(g) OR ARTICLE 300A OF THE CONSTITUTION
116. Section 171 of the Act, 2017 does not violate Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India, as it is
not a price-fixing mechanism. As rightly pointed out by the learned counsel for the Respondents,
Section 171 of the Act, 2017 only relates to the indirect-tax component of the price of goods and
services and does not impinge upon the freedom of suppliers to fix their own prices keeping in view
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 relevant commercial and economic factors.
This Court is in agreement with the learned Amicus Curiae that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is solely
focused on ensuring that the consequential benefit of reduction of the rate of tax by the Government
reaches the recipient.
117. The contention of the petitioners that the fundamental presumption under Section 171 that
every tax reduction must result in 'price reduction' is not correct. The use of the expression 'shall' in
Section 171 of the Act, 2017 means that the supplier is required to pass on the benefit of the reduced
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
87
tax rate and the benefit of Input Tax Credit, and that such passing on is to be carried out only by way
of commensurate reduction of price of the goods or services. Accordingly, costing and
market-related factors are irrelevant for NAA, as it is only required to examine whether or not there
is any reduction in tax rate or benefit of accruing Input Tax Credits and if so whether the same has
been passed on by way of commensurate reduction of prices. The NAA is not concerned with the
price determined by a supplier, for the supply of particular goods or services, exclusive of the GST or
Input Tax Credit component. The supplier is at liberty to set his base prices and vary them in
accordance with the relevant commercial and economic factors or any applicable laws.
Consequently, NAA is only mandated to ensure that the benefit of reduced rates of taxes and Input
Tax Credit is passed on. NAA cannot force the petitioners to sell their goods or services at reduced
prices.
118. This Court is of the view that the manufacturer/supplier despite reduction on rate of tax or
benefit of Input Tax Credits can raise the prices based on commercial factors, as long as the same is
not a pretense. During the hearing, Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel, conceded (as recorded
earlier) that in some cases, commercial factors might necessitate an increase in price despite
reduction in rate of tax or increase in availability of benefit of Input Tax Credits.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
119. This Court is in agreement with the submission of learned Amicus Curiae that if there is any
variation on account of other factors, such as any costs necessitating the setting off of such reduction
of price, the same needs to be justified by the supplier. The inherent presumption that these must
necessarily be a reduction in prices of the goods and services is a rebuttable presumption. It is
clarified that if the supplier is to assert reasons for offsetting the reduction, it must establish the
same on cogent basis and must not use it merely as a device to circumvent the statutory obligation of
reducing the prices in a commensurate manner contemplated under Section 171 of the Act, 2017.
120. This Court is further of the view that the present batch of matters deals with amounts that the
Revenue had foregone in favour of the consumers which however had been either wrongfully
appropriated by the petitioners/suppliers and/or used in their business and/or used for
cross-subsidisation and/or passed off as a special discount to the dealer or the consumer. Therefore,
there cannot be any proprietary interest of the suppliers in such amount which the Government has
foregone in favour of consumers by way of reduction in taxes and no legal or constitutional right can
be asserted thereunder.
121. Clearly, Section 171 of the Act, 2017 has been incorporated with the intent of creating a
framework that ensures that the benefit reaches the ultimate consumer. There cannot be any room
for allowing unjust retention of benefit of reduction in rate of tax or benefit of input tax credit with
the manufacturer/supplier/distributor. The reliance placed by the petitioners on the judgment of
CIT vs. B.C. Srinivasa Setty (1981) 2 SCC 460 and CCE vs. Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (2016) 1 SCC 170, is
completely misconceived as both these judgments were passed specifically in the context of levy of
taxes. As held hereinabove, Section 171 of the Act, 2017 does not levy any tax on supplies and
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 hence these judgments do not apply to the
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
88
present batch of matters. Consequently, the impugned provisions are not a price fixing mechanism
and they do not violate either Article 19(1)(g) or Article 14 or Article 300A of the Constitution of
India.
REFERENCE TO ANTI-PROFITEERING PROVISIONS OF AUSTRALIA AND MALAYSIA IS
MISCONCEIVED
122. The reference to Anti-profiteering provisions under the Australian Trade Practices Act by the
petitioners is misplaced as pointed out by the learned counsel for the Respondents and as according
to the petitioner's own submissions, the Australian Act prohibits 'price exploitation' in relation to
the New Tax System i.e. that the Act by its nature regulates prices. This is different from Section 171
of the Act, 2017 which only requires the suppliers to pass on the benefit of tax reduction and Input
Tax Credit to the recipients of the goods and services. The 'price' aspect comes into play in the
context of Section 171 of the Act, 2017 only when it comes to the manner in which the principal
obligation of passing on benefits as aforesaid, is to be carried out i.e., by way of commensurate
reduction of prices. Consequently, in the case of Section 171, there is no intent of any over- riding
regulation on 'price exploitation' like in the case of the Australian Trade Practices Act referred to by
the petitioners.
123. Similarly, the reference made by the petitioners to the Malaysian Price Control and
Anti-Profiteering Act, 2011 is also misplaced as the said Act, according to the petitioner's own
submission, prohibits suppliers from 'making unreasonably high profit'. By its very nature, the
Malaysian Act controls pricing unlike Section 171 of the Act, 2017 which does not seek to regulate
the pricing of the goods and services or the profits of the suppliers. Consequently, the reference to
Anti-Profiteering provisions of Australia and Malaysia is misconceived.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 NO FIXED/UNIFORM METHOD OR
MATHEMATICAL FORMULA CAN BE LAID DOWN FOR DETERMINING PROFITEERING
124. This Court is of the view that no fixed/uniform method or mathematical formula can be laid
down for determining profiteering as the facts of each case and each industry may be different. The
determination of the profiteered amount has to be computed by taking into account the relevant and
peculiar facts of each case. There is 'no one size that fits all' formula or method that can be
prescribed in the present batch of matters. Consequently, NAA has to determine the appropriate
methodology on a case to case basis keeping in view the peculiar facts and circumstances of each
case.
125. It is also well-established that where a power exists to prescribe a procedure and such power
has not been exercised, the implementing authorities are at liberty to determine and adopt such
procedure as they may deem fit subject to the same being fair and reasonable. In Dhanjibhai
Ramjibhai vs. State of Gujarat (1985) 2 SCC 5, the Supreme Court has held, "...Merely because
procedural rules have not been framed does not imply a negation of the power. In the absence of
such rules, it is sufficient that the power is exercised fairly and reasonably, having regard to the
context in which the power has been granted.". In Chairman & MD, BPL Ltd. vs. S.P. Gururaja and
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
89
Ors., (2003) 8 SCC 567, the Supreme Court has held, "....Under the Act or the Regulations framed
thereunder, no procedure for holding such consultations had been laid down. In that situation it was
open to the competent authorities to evolve their own procedure. Such a procedure of taking a
decision upon deliberations does not fall foul of Article 14 of the Constitution of India."
126. Consequently, Rule 126 of the Rules, 2017 to the extent it grants flexibility to NAA to determine
the methodology and procedure to decide whether reduction W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 in rate of tax or benefit of Input Tax Credit has been passed on or not to the
recipient is reasonable and legal. Moreover, as per Rule 126 NAA 'may determine' the methodology
and not 'prescribe' it. The substantive provision i.e. Section 171 of the Act, 2017 itself provides
sufficient guidance to NAA to determine the methodology on a case by case basis depending upon
peculiar facts of each case and the nature of the industry and its peculiarities. Consequently, so long
as the methodology determined by NAA is fair and reasonable, the petitioners cannot raise the
objection that the specifics of the methodology adopted are not prescribed.
127. Since considerable emphasis was laid by learned counsel for the Petitioners on the methodology
adopted by NAA to determine commensurate reduction qua real estate industry, this Court deems it
appropriate to deal with the same at some length. With the introduction of the Goods and Services
Tax scheme/regime, the availability of Input Tax Credit against various goods and services used in
construction has increased or Input Tax Credit was available against more goods and services then
before this resulted in a decrease in the cost of the builders as they now had more Input Tax Credit
available to be set off against Goods and Services Tax paid by them in the Goods and Services Tax
regime as compared to before and the same was not required to be collected from the consumers.
128. There is no dispute with regard to the methodology to be adopted in the following four
scenarios:-
a. If the flat was completely constructed in the pre-Goods and Services Tax period i.e.
before 01st July, 2017 and if it was purchased by making upfront payment of the
whole price in the pre-Goods and Services Tax period no benefit of Input Tax Credit
would be required to be passed on as the price will include W.P.(C) 7743/2019 &
other connected matters 18:24:48 the cost of taxes on which Input Tax Credit was not
available in the pre-Goods and Services Tax period viz. Central Excise Duty, Entry
Tax etc. b. If the construction of the flat had started in the pre-Goods and Services
Tax period and continued/completed in the post-Goods and Services Tax period and
a buyer purchased the flat by making full upfront payment in the post-Goods and
Services Tax period he is entitled to the benefit of Input Tax Credit on the material
which has been purchased in respect of this flat during the post-Goods and Services
Tax period and on which benefit of Input Tax Credit has been availed by the builder.
The builder has to reduce the price commensurately and pass on the benefit. c. If the
construction of the flat is started in the pre-Goods and Services Tax period and its
construction was continued in the post-Goods and Services Tax period and it was
purchased by the consumer by paying the full amount of price upfront in the pre-
Goods and Services Tax period, the buyer is entitled to claim benefit of Input Tax
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
90
Credit on the taxes paid on the construction material purchased by the builder in the
post-Goods and Services Tax period during which he has been given benefit of Input
Tax Credit on the taxes on which Input Tax Credit was not available in the pre-Goods
and Services Tax and cost of such taxes has been built in the price of the flat by the
builder.
d. If the flat is constructed in the post-Goods and Services Tax period and it is
purchased after construction being complete by making upfront payment of the full
price, no benefit of Input Tax W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters
18:24:48 Credit would be available as the price of the flat would have been fixed after
taking into account the Input Tax Credit which has become available to the builder in
the post-Goods and Services Tax period and which was not available to him in the
pre-Goods and Services Tax.
129. However, this Court finds that the methodology adopted by NAA and DGAP to arrive at the
profiteering amount of the real estate industry was generally based on the difference between the
ratio of Input Tax Credit to turnover under the pre-Goods and Services and Tax and post- Goods
and Services and Tax period. This Court is in agreement with the contention of the learned counsel
for the petitioners representing the real estate companies that the methodology adopted by NAA is
flawed as in the real estate sector, there is no direct correlation between the turnover and the Input
Tax Credit availed for a particular period. The expenses in a real estate project are not uniform
throughout the life cycle of the project and the eligibility of credit depends on the nature of the
construction activity undertaken during the particular period. As it is an admitted position that
neither the advances received nor the construction activity is uniform throughout the life cycle of the
project, the accrual of Input Tax Credit is not related to the amount collected from the buyers. This
Court is in agreement with learned counsel of the petitioners that one needs to calculate the total
savings on account of introduction of Goods and Services and Tax for each project and then divide
the same by total area to arrive at the per square feet benefit to be passed on to each flat buyer. This
would ensure that flat-buyers with equal square feet area received equal benefit. The Court, while
hearing the present batch of matters on merits, shall take the aforesaid direction/interpretation into
account.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 IT IS THE PREROGATIVE OF THE
LEGISLATURE TO DECIDE HOW THE BENEFIT IS TO BE PASSED ON TO THE CONSUMERS
130. It is settled law that it is the prerogative of the Legislature to decide the manner as to how the
reduction in rate of tax or the benefit of Input Tax Credit is to be passed on to the consumer. In
Dr.Ashwani Kumar vs. Union of India, (2020) 13 SCC 585, the Supreme court has held as under:-
"11. The legislature as an elected and representative body enacts laws to give effect to
and fulfil democratic aspirations of the people. The procedures applied are designed
to give careful thought and consideration to wide and divergent interests, voices and
all shades of opinion from different social and political groups. Legislature functions
as a deliberative and representative body. It is directly accountable and answerable to
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
91
the electorate and citizens of this country. This representativeness and principle of
accountability is what gives legitimacy to the legislations and laws made by
Parliament or the State Legislatures. Article 245 of the Constitution empowers
Parliament and the State Legislatures to enact laws for the whole or a part of the
territory of India, and for the whole or a part of the State respectively, after due
debate and discussion in Parliament/the State Assembly."
(emphasis supplied)
131. In the present instance, the legislative mandate is that reduction of the tax rate or the benefit of
Input Tax Credit must not only be reflected in reduction of prices but it must also reach the recipient
of the goods or services. Such a mandate cannot be tampered with by the supplier by substituting
the benefit in the form of reduction of actual price with any other form such as increase in volume or
weight or by supply of additional or free material or festival discount like 'Diwali Dhamaka' or
cross-subsidisation.
132. Further, the requirement that the benefit of the rate reduction and Input Tax Credit reach the
final consumer by way of 'cash in hand' through commensurate reduction in prices, cannot be said
to be manifestly arbitrary. No fundamental or other rights of any of the petitioners are being
affected in any manner by W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 requiring that
the benefit in reduction of tax rate or Input Tax Credits, be passed on to the recipients by way of
commensurate reduction in prices.
133. This Court is in agreement with the submission of Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel for the
Respondents, that the benefit of tax reduction has to be passed on at the level of each supply of SKU
to each buyer and in case it is not passed on, the profiteered amount has to be calculated on each
SKU.
134. The contention of the learned counsel for the Petitioners that it is legally impossible to pass on
the benefits by reducing the price of goods in cases of low priced products is untenable in law. As
pointed out by Mr.Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel for the Respondents, the provisions of the Legal
Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 are applicable. In cases for period prior to 31st
December, 2017, the erstwhile Rule 2(m) of the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules,
2011 which provided detailed instructions for rounding off of the MRP would be applicable.
Similarly, Rule 6(1)(e) of the above Rules as amended in 2017 with effect from 01st January, 2018 to
31st March, 2022 provides that the retail price of the package shall clearly indicate that it is the MRP
inclusive of all taxes and the price in rupees and paise be rounded off to the nearest rupee or 50
paise would be applicable. Consequently, there would be no legal impossibility in reducing the MRP
even in such cases. There is nothing inconsistent in Section 171 with such rounding off.
ACT 2017 RIGHTLY DOES NOT FIX A TIME PERIOD DURING WHICH PRICE-REDUCTION HAS
TO BE OFFERED
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
92
135. This Court is in agreement with the submissions of the respondents and the learned Amicus
Curiae that bearing in mind the very nature of the Act, 2017, it is not proper or feasible to
contemplate any specific period of time for application of W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 the reduced price, as the same has to take effect so long as the direct relation
between the reduction of tax rate or the benefit of Input Tax Credits exists and there is no other
factor effecting/countering the same. If, conceptually, the reduction of tax rate has taken place on a
specified date and there are no justified variations in the cost price or other factors for offsetting
such reduction in the prices for a particular period of time, clearly for that period a reduced price
must govern the transaction. This Court is of the view that providing for a particular period of time
for operation of the provisions would be not be in conformity with the scheme and intent of the Act,
2017 itself.
SECTION 64A OF SALE OF GOODS ACT IS NOT APPLICABLE TO THE OBLIGATION UNDER
SECTION 171
136. This Court is in agreement with the submission of learned counsel for the Respondents that
Section 64A of Sale of Goods Act, 1930 has no applicability to the obligation under Section 171 of the
Act, 2017 as the former only confers a discretion on the buyer to reduce the contract price to the
extent of reduction in taxes, whereas Section 171 imposes a positive obligation on the supplier to
make a commensurate reduction in the price when the Government reduces the rate of tax.
Therefore there is no inconsistency between the two laws.
137. Moreover, the CGST/SGST Acts, 2017 are independent Acts and there is no provision under
these Acts that tax reduction ordered under these Acts would be subject to the provisions of Sale of
Goods Act, 1930 or the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Tax reduction is given by sacrificing tax revenue
and hence the Governments are legally competent to direct the suppliers to pass on the benefit of
such tax reduction to the consumers after its notification. Any contract made in violation of public
policy of passing on the benefit would be void. Consequently, W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 all contracts (a) whether they are pending to be performed or (b) executed after
tax reduction and/or (c) have already been concluded before tax reduction, have to implemented
keeping in view the mandate enshrined in Section 171 of the Act, 2017.
A STATUTORY PROVISION CANNOT BE STRUCK DOWN ON THE GROUND OF POSSIBILITY
OF ABUSE
138. During the course of hearing, learned counsel for the petitioners advanced a number of
hypothetical situations to suggest that there is a possibility of abuse of Section 171 of the Act, 2017.
However, it is settled law that Acts and their provisions are not to be declared unconstitutional on
the fanciful theory that power would be exercised in an unrealistic fashion or in a vacuum or on the
ground that there is an apprehension of misuse of statutory provision or possibility of abuse of
power. It must be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that administration and application of a
particular law would be done "not with an evil eye and unequal hand". Some of the relevant
Supreme Court judgments are reproduced hereinbelow:-
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
93
A. In Maganlal Chhaganlal (P) Ltd. Vs. Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay &
Ors., (1974) 2 SCC 402 it has been held as under:-
"15.....The statute itself in the two classes of cases before us clearly lays down the
purpose behind them, that is that premises belonging to the Corporation and the
Government should be subject to speedy procedure in the matter of evicting
unauthorized persons occupying them. This is a sufficient guidance for the
authorities on whom the power has been conferred. With such an indication clearly
given in the statutes one expects the officers concerned to avail themselves of the
procedures prescribed by the Acts and not resort to the dilatory procedure of the
ordinary civil court. Even normally one cannot imagine an officer having the choice
of two procedures, one which enables him to get possession of the property quickly
and the other which would be a prolonged one, to resort to the latter. Administrative
officers, no less than the courts, do not function in a vacuum. It would be extremely
unreal to hold that an administrative officer would in taking W.P.(C) 7743/2019 &
other connected matters 18:24:48 proceedings for eviction of unauthorised occupants
of Government property or Municipal property resort to the procedure prescribed by
the two Acts in one case and to the ordinary civil court in the other. The provisions of
these two Acts cannot be struck down on the fanciful theory that power would be
exercised in such an unrealistic fashion. In considering whether the officers would be
discriminating between one set of persons and another, one has got to take into
account normal human behaviour and not behaviour which is abnormal. It is not
every fancied possibility of discrimination but the real risk of discrimination that we
must take into account. This is not one of those cases where discrimination is writ
large on the face of the statute. Discrimination may be possible but is very
improbable. And if there is discrimination in actual practice this Court is not
powerless. Furthermore, the fact that the Legislature considered that the ordinary
procedure is insufficient or ineffective in evicting unauthorised occupants of
Government and Corporation property and provided a special speedy procedure
therefore is a clear guidance for the authorities charged with the duty of evicting
unauthorised occupants. We, therefore, find ourselves unable to agree with the
majority in the Northern India Caterers case."
(emphasis supplied) B. In Collector of Customs v. Nathella Sampathu Chetty, 1962 SCC OnLine SC
30 , the Supreme Court has held as under:-
"34....This Court has held in numerous rulings, to which it is unnecessary to refer,
that the possibility of the abuse of the powers under the provisions contained in any
statute is no ground for declaring the provision to be unreasonable or void. *** The
possibility of abuse of a statute otherwise valid does not impart to it any element of
invalidity. The converse must also follow that a statute which is otherwise invalid as
being unreasonable cannot be saved by its being administered in a reasonable
manner. The constitutional validity of the statute would have to be determined on the
basis of its provisions and on the ambit of its operation as reasonably construed. If so
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
94
judged it passes the test of reasonableness, possibility of the powers conferred being
improperly used is no ground for pronouncing the law itself invalid and similarly if
the law properly interpreted and tested in the light of the requirements set out in Part
III of the Constitution does not pass the test it cannot be pronounced valid merely
because it is administered in a manner which might not conflict with the
constitutional requirements. In saying this we are not to be understood as laying
down that a law which might operate, harshly but still be constitutionally valid
should be operated always with harshness or that reasonableness and justness ought
not to guide the actual administration of such laws."
(emphasis supplied) W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 C. In Mafatlal
Industries Ltd. v. Union of India, (1997) 5 SCC 536, a nine Judge Bench of the Supreme Court while
considering the validity of provisions of the Central Excise and Customs Law (Amendment) Act,
1991 has held as under:-
"88.....It is equally well-settled that mere possibility of abuse of a provision by those
in charge of administering it cannot be a ground for holding the provision
procedurally or substantively unreasonable. In Collector of Customs v. Nathella
Sampathu Chetty [(1962) 3 SCR 786 : AIR 1962 SC 316] , this Court observed:
"The possibility of abuse of a statute otherwise valid does not impart to it any element
of invalidity." It was said in State of Rajasthan v. Union of India [(1977) 3 SCC 592 :
(1978) 1 SCR 1] (SCR at p. 77), "it must be remembered that merely because power
may sometimes be abused, it is no ground for denying the existence of power. The
wisdom of man has not yet been able to conceive of a government with power
sufficient to answer all its legitimate needs and at the same time incapable of
mischief". (Also see Commr., H.R.E. v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri
Shirur Mutt [1954 SCR 1005 : AIR 1954 SC 282] (SCR at p. 1030)."
(emphasis supplied) TO NOT COMPARE TAXES LEVIED AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF THE
ACT, 2017 WITH A BASKET OF DISTINCT INDIRECT TAXES APPLICABLE BEFORE THE
OPERATION OF THE ACT WOULD GO AGAINST THE INTENT AND OBJECTIVE OF ACT, 2017.
139. Prior to coming into force of the Act, 2017, several taxes were levied on goods and services by
the Central Government (such as Central Excise tax, Service tax, Central Sales tax etc.) and by the
State Government (such as Value Added tax, Luxury tax, Purchase tax etc.). There was multiplicity
of taxes as they were levied on the same supply system. This had a cascading effect as there was no
provision for set off. The Hon'ble Prime Minister at the launch of Goods and Services Tax stated "If
we take into consideration the 29 states, the 7 Union Territories, the 7 taxes of the Centre and the 8
taxes of the States, and several different taxes for different commodities, the number of taxes sum
up to a figure W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 of 500! Today all those taxes
will be shred off to have ONE NATION, ONE TAX right from Ganganagar to Itanagar and from Leh
to Lakshdweep".

140. Additionally, a plethora of non-tariff barriers like octroi, entry tax, check posts etc. hindered
free flow of trade throughout the country and this entailed a high compliance cost for taxpayers. The
Act, 2017 has subsumed the earlier catena of indirect taxes (Central as well as State indirect taxes),
inasmuch as, it levies a single tax on the supply of goods and services. Consequently, the submission
of learned senior counsel for the Petitioner in W.P.(C) 1171/2020 that Section 171(1) of the Act, 2017
does not contemplate a comparison of the taxes levied after the introduction of the Act, 2017 with a
basket of distinct indirect taxes applicable on goods and services before the operation of the Act goes
against the grain, intent and object of the Act, 2017.
THERE IS NO VESTED RIGHT OF APPEAL AND AN APPEAL IS A CREATURE OF THE STATUTE
141. As discussed earlier, Rule 129 of the Rules, 2017 provides for a comprehensive mechanism for
initiation and conduct of proceedings relating to anti-profiteering. The conscious provisioning of
different layers of examination which, in the first place, is purely fact-based clearly demonstrates
that appropriate precautions and redressal measures are provided for in the Scheme of the Act, 2017
read with the Rules, 2017 in connection therewith on the subject of Anti- Profiteering. Consequently,
there is no basis for contending that unbrindled powers have been given to the Authority or that
there is a lack of appropriate redressal mechanism under the Scheme.
142. In any event, it is well settled that there is no vested right of appeal and an appeal is a creature
of the Statute. Right of appeal is neither a natural nor an inherent right vested in a party. It is a
substantive statutory right regulated by the W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48
Statute creating it. To provide for an appeal or not under a Statute is a pure question of legislative
policy (See: Kondiba Dagadu Kadam v. Savitribai Sopan Gujar (1999) 3 SCC 722 and Kashmir Singh
v. Harnam Singh (2008) 12 SCC
796).
143. If Legislature chooses not to provide for a right to appeal against an order of the authority that
itself cannot be a ground to declare an enactment as unconstitutional. This Court in Wing
Commander Shyam Naithani vs. Union of India and Ors., W.P.(C) 6483/2021 & connected matters,
2022 SCC OnLine Del 769 has held as under:
"40. However, this Court would like to clarify that a right to appeal is a creation of
Statute and it cannot be claimed as a matter of right. The right to appeal has to exist.
It cannot be created by acquiescence of the parties or by the order of the Court. It is
neither a natural nor an inherent right attached to the litigant being a substantive,
statutory right. [See: United Commercial Bank Ltd. v. Their Workmen, AIR 1951 SC
230; Kondiba Dagdu Kodam v. Savitribai Sopan Gujar, AIR 1999 SC 2213; and UP
Power Corporation Ltd. v. Virenddra Lal, (2013) 10 SCC 39]. Jurisdiction cannot be
conferred by mere acceptance, acquiescence, consent or by any other means as it can
be conferred only by the legislature as conferring jurisdiction upon a Court or
Authority, is a legislative function..."

(emphasis supplied)
144. Further, the decisions of NAA are subject to judicial review under Article 226 before the
jurisdictional High Courts as is evident from the fact that several petitions have been filed before
this Court challenging orders of the NAA. This shows that the affected parties are exercising their
right to seek remedies under Article 226 against orders of NAA.
145. Consequently, a robust mechanism in conformity with the constitutional requirements is in
place for dealing with grievances of breach of Section 171(1) of the Act, 2017 and hence, it cannot be
said that there is no judicial oversight over the decisions of NAA [See: CCI v. SAIL (supra), Shiv
Shakti Coop. Housing Society v. Swaraj Developers, (2003) 6 SCC 659].
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT OF
JUDICIAL MEMBER IN NAA
146. By its very nature, Section 171(1) of the Act, 2017 clearly lays down the express issues which
need to be examined by the Authority and this examination is in the nature of a fact-finding
exercise. Therefore, the mandate of the Authority is very specific in nature and is akin to a
fact-finding exercise. This Court is of the opinion that NAA is primarily a fact-finding body which is
required to investigate whether suppliers have passed on the benefit to their recipients by way of
reduced prices as mandated by Section 171 of the Act, 2017. On examining the role and duties of
NAA under Section 171(2) of the Act, 2017 and Rule 127 of the Rules, 2017, it is apparent that NAA
performs functions that are to be discharged by domain experts.
147. Even otherwise NAA has not assumed any jurisdiction which was hitherto being exercised by
the High Court or any other judicial body, and so, the principle that there must be a judicial member
in quasi-judicial entities as laid down in the decisions relied upon by the petitioners does not apply
in the present batch of matters.
148. In the case of Namit Sharma vs. Union of India (2013) 1 SCC 745, the Supreme Court
considered the question of the requirement of a judicial member for performing the functions and
exercising the powers of the Chief Information Commissioner. The Supreme Court initially held that
the Information Commission and the Central Information Commissioners perform judicial
functions possessing the essential attributes and trappings of a court and hence, it must have
judicial members. However, while deciding the review petition filed by the Union of India, the
Supreme Court in its judgment reported as Union of India vs. Namit Sharma (2013) 10 SCC 359 has
held that "the powers exercised W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 by the
Information Commissions under the Act were not earlier vested in the High Court or subordinate
court or any other court and are not in any case judicial powers and therefore the legislature need
not provide for appointment of judicial members in the Information Commission."
149. Similarly, statutory bodies like TRAI, Medical Council of India, Institute of Chartered
Accountant of India etc., perform quasi-judicial functions but do not have judicial members.
Furthermore, Assessing Officers, CIT(Appeals) and the Dispute Resolution Panel under the Income
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10215791/
97
Tax Act, 1961 all perform quasi- judicial functions but there is no requirement that such members
must possess either a law degree or have judicial experience. Consequently, this Court is of the view
that there is no requirement for a judicial member in NAA.
150. While this Court is in agreement with the submission of the Petitioners that the provision of a
second or casting vote to the Chairman in the event of a tie/equality of votes as was given in Rule
134(2) of the Rules, 2017 is impermissible, yet as the Respondents have stated that the said
provision has never been used, this Court does not deem it necessary to delve into a detailed
discussion of the same.
151. Additionally, the Petitioners have challenged the validity of the constitution of the NAA on
account of absence of a gazette notification as allegedly required under Section 171(2) of the Act,
2017. This Court is of the opinion that this issue does not affect the constitutional validity of the
impugned section which is presently under consideration and so this issue is not being dealt with in
the present judgment.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 RULE 124 IS IN CONSONANCE WITH
ARTICLE 50. THERE IS NO SCOPE FOR GOVERNMENTAL INTERFERENCE IN FUNCTIONS
EXERCISED BY NAA
152. This Court is of the view that Rule 124 of the Rules, 2017 is in consonance with Article 50 of the
Constitution, inasmuch as, selection to NAA is made on the recommendation by a Selection
Committee constituted by the Goods and Services Tax Council which is a constitutional body.
Similarly the services of the Chairperson and members of NAA can be terminated only with the
approval of the Chairman of the Goods and Services Tax Council. Consequently, the members of
NAA are free to carry out their function as they deem fit and there is no scope whatsoever for any
Governmental interference in the functions exercised by NAA.
RULE 133 TO THE EXTENT IT PROVIDES FOR LEVY OF INTEREST AND PENALTY IS WITHIN
THE RULE MAKING POWER OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
153. This Court is of the view that Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is broad enough to empower the
Central Government to prescribe penalty and interest to ensure that the suppliers are deterred from
pocketing the benefits meant for the consumers when taxes are foregone by the Government. Merely
empowering NAA to direct returning of the amounts so pocketed by the supplier/registered person
would not have a sufficient deterrent effect on deviant behavior unless interest and penalty are
levied to prevent such actions from taking place in the first place. The width and amplitude of
Section 171 by which the authority is empowered to ensure that reduction in tax rate or the Input
Tax Credit availed results in commensurate reduction in the price of goods or services clearly
encompasses within it the power to ensure that such conduct which leads to profiteering does not
take place.

154. Section 164 of the Act, 2017 gives power to the Government to make rules for carrying out
provisions of the Act and in particular to provide for penalty. Section 164 of the Act, 2017 is
reproduced hereinbelow:-
"164. Power of Government to make rules (1) The Government may, on the
recommendations of the Council, by notification, make rules for carrying out the
provisions of this Act.
(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of sub-section (1), the
Government may make rules for all or any of the matters which by this Act are
required to be, or may be, prescribed or in respect of which provisions are to be or
may be made by rules.
(3) The power to make rules conferred by this section shall include the power to give
retrospective effect to the rules or any of them from a date not earlier than the date
on which the provisions of this Act come into force.
(4) Any rules made under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) may provide that a
contravention thereof shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding ten thousand rupees."
155. Accordingly, Rule 133(3)(b)&(d) of the Rules, 2017 which empower the authority to levy
interest @ 18% from the date of collection of the higher amount till the date of the return of such
amount as well as imposition of penalty are intra vires and within the Rule making power of the
Central Government.
156. Moreover, as pointed out by Mr. Zoheb Hossain, the show cause notices initiating penalty
proceedings in relation to violation of Section 171(1) prior to the coming into force of Section
171(3A), have been withdrawn by NAA and penalty proceedings in all such cases are not being
pressed. Consequently, this issue has become infructuous.
W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected matters 18:24:48 GOODS AND SERVICES TAX
COLLECTED ON THE ADDITIONAL REALIZATION HAS RIGHTLY BEEN INCLUDED IN THE
PROFITEERED AMOUNT
157. Both the Central as well as the State Government had no intent of collecting additional Goods
and Services Tax on the higher price as they had sacrificed their revenue in favour of the buyer. By
compelling the buyers to pay the additional Goods and Services Tax on a higher price, the supplier
has not only defeated the intent of the Governments but has also acted against the interest of the
consumer and therefore, the Goods and Services Tax collected by him on the additional realization
has rightly been included in the profiteered amount.
TIME LIMIT FOR FURNISHING OF REPORT BY DGAP IS DIRECTORY AND NOT MANDATORY
Affiniti Enterprises vs Union Of India & Ors. on 29 January, 2024

158. In some cases, the Petitioners have pointed out that the timelines as provided in the Rules, 2017
have not been followed. They further contended that as a result, the proceedings are vitiated.
However, it is important to note that the Rules, 2017 do not provide any consequences in case the
time limits provided thereunder lapse. As held earlier, the anti-profiteering provisions in the Act,
2017 and the Rules, 2017 are in the nature of a beneficial legislation as they promote consumer
welfare. The Courts have consistently held that beneficial legislation must receive liberal
construction that favors the consumer and promotes the intent and objective of the Act. That being
the scenario, it cannot be said that the proceedings as a whole abate on lapse of time limit of
furnishing of report by DGAP. The Supreme Court in P.T. Rajan Vs. T.P.M. Sahir and Ors. (2003) 8
SCC 498 has held that "It is well-settled principle of law that where a statutory functionary is asked
to perform a statutory duty within the time prescribed W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other connected
matters 18:24:48 therefore, the same would be directory and not mandatory." and that "a provision
in a statute which is procedural in nature although employs the word "shall" may not be held to be
mandatory if thereby no prejudice is caused." Consequently, the time limit provided for furnishing
of report by DGAP is directory in nature and not mandatory.
EXPANSION OF INVESTIGATION BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE COMPLAINT IS NOT ULTRA
VIRES THE STATUTE
159. Section 171 of the Act, 2017 is widely worded and does not limit the scope of examination to
only goods and services in respect of which a complaint is received. The scope of powers of the
DGAP is provided for in Rule 129 of the Rules, 2017. From a reading of the said Rule especially the
expression 'any supply of goods or services' used in sub-rule (2) of Rule 129, it is apparent that the
scope of the DGAP's powers is very wide and is not limited to the goods or services in relation to
which a Complaint is received. The word 'any' includes within its scope 'some' as well as 'all'.
160. In any event, the ignorance of the consumer or lack of information or surrounding complexity
in the supply chain cannot be permitted to defeat the objective of a consumer welfare regulatory
measure and it is in this light that the subject provision is required to be construed.
161. In the context of similar powers of investigation exercised by the Director General under the
Competition Act, 2002, the Supreme Court in Excel Crop Care Ltd. vs. Competition Commission of
India, (2017) 8 SCC 47, has held that the Director General would be well within its powers to
investigate and report on matters not covered by the complaint or the reference order of the
Commission, and an interpretation to the contrary would render the entire purpose of investigation
nugatory. The High Court of Delhi in Cadila Healthcare Ltd. & W.P.(C) 7743/2019 & other
connected matters 18:24:48 Anr. vs. CCI & Ors., (2018) SCCOnline Del 11229, relying on the
judgment of the Supreme Court in Excel Crop Care (supra) has clarified in express terms that the
scope of investigation by the Director General is not restricted to the matter stated in the Complaint
and includes other allied as well as unenumerated matters. Consequently, the expansion of
investigation or proceedings beyond the scope of the complaint is not ultra vires the statute.

162. Before parting with the present batch of matters, this Court places on record its appreciation for
the assistance rendered by all the learned counsel, who appeared, in particular, Mr. Amar Dave,
learned Amicus Curiae, Mr. V. Lakshmikumaran and Mr. Zoheb Hossain, Advocates as they filed not
only multiple written submissions but also ensured that hearing in the present batch of matters
(exceeding 100 cases) was conducted in an orderly and proper manner.
TO SUM UP
163. Keeping in view the aforesaid conclusions, the constitutional validity of Section 171 of Act, 2017
as well as Rules 122, 124, 126, 127, 129, 133 and 134 of the Rules, 2017 is upheld. This Court clarifies
that it is possible that there may be cases of arbitrary exercise of power under the anti-profiteering
mechanism by enlarging the scope of the proceedings beyond the jurisdiction or on account of not
considering the genuine basis of variations in other factors such as cost escalations on account of
which the reduction stands offset, skewed input credit situations etc. However, the remedy for the
same is to set aside such orders on merits. What will be struck down in such cases will not be the
provision itself which invests such power on the concerned authority but the erroneous application
of the power.
